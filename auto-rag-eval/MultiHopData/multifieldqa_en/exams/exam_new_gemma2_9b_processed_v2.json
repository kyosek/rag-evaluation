      "The bounded depth-first search (BDFS) algorithm tries to improve the dequeuing process. The goal is to prevent a vertex in conflict with some adjacent colored vertices from entering in the conflict set. At the first level, the algorithm searches for a recoloring of some adjacent vertices which allows us to directly recolor the conflict vertex. If no solution is found, the algorithm In both figures the algorithm uses p = 1.2, easy vertices, q max = 59022, but does not use the BDFS nor any clique. For \u03c3 \u2265 0.25, no solution better than 248 colors is found. could recolor some vertices at larger distances from the conflict vertex. To do so, a local search is performed by trying to recolor vertices at a bounded distance from the conflict vertex in the current partial solution. The BDFS algorithm has two parameters: adjacency bound a max and depth d. In order to recolor a vertex v, BDFS gets the set C of color classes with at most a max neighbors of v. If a class in C has no neighbor of v, v is assigned to C. Otherwise, for each class C \u2208 C, BDFS tries to recolor the vertices in C which are adjacent to v by recursively calling itself with depth d \u2212 1. At depth d = 0 the algorithm stops trying to color the vertices. During the challenge the Shadoks used BDFS with parameters a max = 3 and d = 3. The depth was increased to 5 (resp. 7) when the number of vertices in the queue was 2 (resp. 1). Degeneracy order Given a target number of colors k, we call easy vertices a set of vertices Y such that, if the remainder of the vertices of G are colored using k colors, then we are guaranteed to be able to color all vertices of G with k colors. This is obtained using the degeneracy order Y . To obtain Y we iteratively remove from the graph a vertex v that has at most k \u2212 1 neighbors, appending v to the end of Y . We repeat until no other vertex can be added to Y . Notice that, once we color the remainder of the graph with at least k colors, we can use a greedy coloring for Y in order from last to first without increasing the number of colors used.",
      "Adding the conflict-minimization phase gave minor improvements to some of the challenge instances. Shadoks\n\nIn this section, we describe the choices used by the Shadoks team for the options described in Section 2.1. The Shadoks generally chose to eliminate the color with the smallest number of elements. However, if the multistart option is toggled on, then a random color is used each time. The conflict set S is stored in a queue. The Shadoks tried other strategies, but found that the queue gives the best results. The weight function used is w(u) = 1 + q(u) p , mostly with p = 1.2. The effect of the parameter p is shown in Fig. . Notice that in all figures, the number of colors shown is the average of ten executions of the code using different random seeds. The algorithm uses \u03c3 = 0.15, easy vertices, q max = 59022, but does not use the BDFS nor any clique. If q(u) is larger than a threshold q max , the Shadoks set w(u) = \u221e so that the vertex u never reenters S. If at some point an uncolored vertex v is adjacent to some vertex u of infinite weight in every color class, then the conflict optimizer is restarted. When restarting, the initial coloring is shuffled by moving some vertices from their initial color class to a new one. Looking at Fig. , the value of q max does not seem to have much influence as long as it is not too small. Throughout the challenge the Shadoks almost exclusively used q max = 2000 \u2022 (75000/m) 2 , where m is the number of vertices. This value roughly ensures a restart every few hours. q max =0.5k q max =5k q max =50k q max =100k q max =250k The Shadoks use the function f as a Gaussian random variable of mean 1 and variance \u03c3. A good default value is \u03c3 = 0.15. The effect of the variance is shown in Fig. . Notice that setting \u03c3 = 0 gives much worse results. Option (e) The goal of BDFS is to further optimize very good solutions that the conflict optimizer is not able to improve otherwise. Fig. shows the influence of BDFS. While on this figure, the advantages of BDFS cannot be noticed, its use near the end of the challenge improved about 30 solutions."

Its tricky. ey dun new ho to yet it uff. Yet you complain almost everyday here, on your website, Twitter, and YouTube channel that the game needs to change because cubing has such an impact. It was fun. Swarm had me scared at first, but it turned into kind of a bullying match between us and legion. Last hour became p obvious which way it was gonna go. Legion rly stepped up their game in the end there, respect. We are investigating this. Here is what we know: Several of the accounts used the same password. Most of the accounts belonged to people who knew each other personally. The accounts were all switched from the same IP Addresses. The person who logged in, got into each account on the first attempt, so they knew the password for each account. What you should know: QONQR never stores passwords, not even in the logs. Passwords are hashed (one way encrypted) and can never be decrypted When you authenticate to our servers, we hash the password you gave us and compare it to the encrypted password in the database to see if they match. Access to our database in the could is restricted tightly and we are confident no one breached the system. What you should do: Don't use the same password as other people you play with. Don't share your password with anyone. I heard all the French players fled to the UK after one German player accidentally shot a single missile into France. Most factions now use GroupMe or Line as their means of communication, the forums are too slow as a means of communication and insecure for specific faction conversations. Think of the forums are more of a gaming information resource rather than a means of communication. Contact the top players of your faction in the leader boards of your state and they will likely point you in the right direction to chatting with your local faction.",

You do not have to play for every faction for 60 days in order to earn free switching status.

Without the self-destruct, you would be required to battle against your former self to regain control of your zones. You will lose the capture and leadership of any zones you currently hold. Lifetime captures will be unaffected. If you are still completing the training levels and have not reached Level 100, you may switch as often as you like to find the faction that suits you best.

      "Specifically, the original plastic network now provides the agent with information about the value of the nearest food. The embodied agent has additional sensors for the distance from the nearest food, the angle between the current velocity and the nearest food direction, its own velocity, and its own energy level (sum of consumed food values). These inputs are processed by two hidden layers (of 30 and 15 neurons) with tanh activation. The network's outputs are angular and linear acceleration, Fig. . The embodied agents spawn in a 2D space with periodic boundary conditions along with a number of food particles that are selected such that the mean of the food value distribution is \u223c 0. An agent can eat food by approaching it sufficiently closely, and each time a food particle is eaten, it is The sensor layer receives inputs at each time step (the ingredients of the nearest food), which are processed by the plastic layer in the same way as the static sensory network, Fig. . The output of that network is given as input to the motor network, along with the distance d and angle \u03b1 to the nearest food, the current velocity v, and energy E of the agent. These signals are processed through two hidden layers to the final output of motor commands as the linear and angular acceleration of the agent re-spawned with the same value somewhere randomly on the grid (following the setup of ). After 5000 time steps, the cumulative reward of the agent (the sum of the values of all the food it consumed) is taken as its fitness. During the evolutionary optimization, the parameters for both the motor network (connections) and plastic network (learning rule parameters) are co-evolved, and so agents must simultaneously learn to move and discriminate good/bad food. Reward-modulated plasticity is one of the most promising explanations for biological credit assignment . In our network, the plasticity rule that updates the weights of the linear sensor network is a rewardmodulated rule which is parameterized as a linear combination of the input, the output, and the reward at each time step:\nAdditionally, after each plasticity step, the weights are normalized by mean subtraction, an important step for the stabilization of Hebbian-like plasticity rules ."

A conventional regression model indicated a positive relationship between seafood consumption rates and hair mercury concentrations suggesting the importance of mercury exposure through seafood consumption. The annual-average daily methylmercury intake rate for the studied communities calculated by Monte Carlo simulations followed the sequence: Vietnamese community\u00c2 >\u00c2 Chinese community\u00c2 >\u00c2 non-Asian communities. Regardless, their daily methylmercury intake rates were all lower than the United States Environmental Protection Agency reference dose of 0.1\u00c2 \u00c2\u00b5g/kg body weight-day. In conclusion, fish-consumption patterns differed among communities, which resulted in different levels of mercury exposure. The greater seafood and mercury ingestion rates of studied Asian groups compared with non-Asian groups suggest the need for specific seafood consumption advice for ethnic communities in the United States. Otherwise the health benefits from fish consumption could be perceived as trivial compared with the ill-defined risk of mercury exposure. Feather growth influences blood mercury level of young songbirds. Condon, Anne M; Cristol, Daniel A\nDynamics of mercury in feathers and blood of free-living songbirds is poorly understood. Nestling eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) living along the mercury-contaminated South River (Virginia, USA) had blood mercury levels an order of magnitude lower than their parents (nestling: 0.09 +/- 0.06 mg/kg [mean +/- standard deviation], n = 156; adult: 1.21 +/- 0.57 mg/kg, n = 86). To test whether this low blood mercury was the result of mercury sequestration in rapidly growing feathers, we repeatedly sampled free-living juveniles throughout the period of feather growth and molt.",

      "Moreover, the use of general search terms may not provide the accuracy or precision needed by the user. Furthermore, even if a user may eventually determine the information, the effort and time required may distract the user from the media asset. Accordingly, methods and systems are described herein for quickly and easily displaying supplemental information about an event occurring in a media asset. In some embodiments, a media application may use a content-recognition module to determine the context of an event in a media asset and distribute itemized tasks to multiple users in order to generate the supplemental information about the event. The context-recognition module prevents the user from being distracted from the media asset (e.g., while the user attempts to describe the context of the event or search for information about the event). In addition, by distributing tasks to multiple entities (e.g., crowd-sourcing), the media application may collect large amounts of information in relatively short periods of time (or in real-time) and aggregate and/or filter the information to generate the supplemental information about the event based on multiple viewpoints and/or sources. By using multiple viewpoints and/or sources, the media application enhances the completeness (e.g., by providing unbiased information) and accuracy of the supplemental information. For example, when a statement or action is made by a character or person appearing on a media asset (e.g., a television program), a user may request supplemental information about the statement or action. In response, the media application may determine the context of the statement (e.g., who said the statement and to what the statement was referring) or action (e.g., what was the reason for the action). After determining the context of the statement or action, the media application may itemize into tasks the additional information it requires in order to generate the supplemental information. The media application may then transmit requests including the tasks to a plurality of other users.",
      "In addition, the methods and systems increase the completeness and accuracy of the information compared to information gathered using traditional searching methods (e.g., an Internet search engine), without distracting the user from the media asset. In some embodiments, a media application may receive a user input from a user device for supplemental information about the context of an event shown in a media asset. The media application may determine additional information required to generate the supplemental information about the context of the event shown in a media asset, and transmit requests for the additional information to one or more users. The media application may receive one or more messages, which include the requested additional information, from the one or more users and generate the supplemental information based on the one or more message. The media application may then instruct the user device to display the supplemental information. As used herein, \u201csupplemental information\u201d refers to any information related to or associated with an event in a media asset. For example, supplemental information may include, but is not limited to, the verification of a statement or claim in a media asset, further descriptions and/or information about objects or entities shown and/or described in a media asset, and/or any other information, including, but not limited to, a video or audio segment, that may interest a user about an event in a media asset. In some embodiments, the media application may generate supplemental information based on one or more pieces of additional information. As used herein, \u201cadditional information\u201d refers to any information used to generate supplemental information. For example, in an embodiment in which supplement information is the verification of a statement made by a person displayed in a media asset, and a request for the additional information from the media application includes a request for a fact needed to verify the factual basis of the statement, the additional information may be the fact used to verify the statement."

      "Software is becoming ever more important than hardware. Multiplying SoCs means multiplying product development costs, making support and updates more difficult... Again, unless volumes are huge, OEMs are probaly better off going the way of the car industry and using modular \"platforms\" housed in different chassis with various screen sizes, keyboards, radios, digitizers...I'm wondering why the \"single device\" trend does not figure in your analysis. Is it stillborn ? Does it have no impact nor dependency on/with SoCs ? Samsung has its own bespoke OS: Bada and it is used on an extensive line of devices. I think there are numbers somewhere that it outsold Windows Phone 7 for a time. gypsumfantastic wrote:Why wouldn't the foundries be able close the process gap with Intel? Is it a matter of money? Scale?First mover advantage. SoC? System on a Chip I guess? You're way off on the Moore's Law/cost of smartphones point. The processors used in today's high-end smartphones are already cheap, around $25. And there are less expensive options if you want a lower end product. In fact, the hardware in the whole smartphone is relatively cheap. Analyst's estimate the Z10's materials cost around $160, the iPhone 5 around $140. They're using expensive glass and metals, then there's the battery, memory, etc. which means the processor is a small factor of the cost. And then there's the jump from $140 in materials to the unsubsidized costs. The reason these phones cost $650 is because of the high margins these companies are able to get and the high cost of hardware design and/or software development. But the point is that making the processors 4 times better/cheaper isn't going to change the economics of the smartphone. What will change the economics is commoditized designs and software and cheaper materials all around. Then you'll have a $50 smartphone that's decent.

      "The future of mobile CPUs, part 1: Today\u2019s fork in the road | Ars Technica\n2013 may be a big year for the evolution of smartphones and tablets. Mobile computing's rise from niche market to the mainstream is among the most significant technological trends in our lifetimes. And to a large extent, it's been driven by the bounty of Moore\u2019s Law\u2014the rule that transistor density doubles every 24 months. Initially, most mobile devices relied on highly specialized hardware to meet stringent power and size budgets. But with so many transistors available, devices inevitably grew general-purpose capabilities. Most likely, that wasn't even the real motivation. The initial desire was probably to reduce costs by creating a more flexible software ecosystem with better re-use and faster time to market. As such, the first smartphones were very much a novelty, and it took many years before the world realized the potential of such devices. Apple played a major role by creating innovative smartphones that consumers craved and quickly adopted. To some extent, this is where we still stand today. Smartphones are still (relatively) expensive and primarily interesting to the developed world. But over the next 10 years, this too will change. As Moore\u2019s Law rolls on, the cost of a low-end smartphone will decline. At some point, the incremental cost will be quite minimal and many feature phones of today will be supplanted by smartphones. A $650 unsubsidized phone is well beyond the reach of most of the world compared to a $20 feature phone, but a $30 to $40 smartphone would naturally be very popular. In this grand progression, 2013 will certainly be a significant milestone for mobile devices, smartphones and beyond. It's likely to be the first year in which tablets out-ship notebooks in the US. And in the coming years, this will lead to a confluence of high-end tablets and ultra-mobile notebooks as the world figures out how these devices co-exist, blend, hybridize, and/or merge. Against this backdrop, in this two-part series, we'll explore the major trends and evolution for mobile SoCs."

      "Since both $S(t)\\geq 0$ and $E(t)\\geq 0$ we further derive from Eq.~\\eqref{eq:energya} and Eq.~\\eqref{eq:energyb} that the kinetic energy\nis bounded by $E(t) \\leq T_eS(t) + E(t) = T_e S(0)$; a feature absent from the gravitational system with \nincompressible flows, where $S(t) = S(0)$. \n\nWe now show that the invariants Eqs.~\\eqref{eq:energya} and \\eqref{eq:energyb} present restrictions on the velocity and\nacceleration of plasma blobs. First, we define the blobs' center of mass (COM) via $X(t):= \\int\\mathrm{dA}\\, x(n-n_0)/M$ and \nits COM velocity as $V(t):=\\d X(t)/\\d t$. The latter is proportional to the total radial particle flux~\\cite{Garcia_Bian_Fundamensky_POP_2006, Held2016a}. We assume\nthat $n>n_0$ and $(n-n_0)^2/2 \\leq [ n\\ln (n/n_0) - (n-n_0)]n $ to show for both systems \n\\begin{align}\n  (MV)^2 &= \\left( \\int \\mathrm{dA}\\, n{\\phi_y}/{B} \\right)^2\n  = \\left( \\int \\mathrm{dA}\\, (n-n_0){\\phi_y}/{B} \\right)^2\\nonumber\\\\\n \n&\\leq 2 \\left( \\int \\mathrm{dA}\\, \\left[n\\ln (n/n_0) -(n-n_0)\\right]^{1/2}\\sqrt{n}{\\phi_y}/{B}\\right)^2\\nonumber\\\\\n \n  &\\leq 4 S(0) E(t)/m_i \n \n  \\label{eq:inequality}\n\\end{align} Here we use the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and \n$\\phi_y:=\\partial\\phi/\\partial y$. \nNote that although we derive the inequality Eq.~\\eqref{eq:inequality} only for amplitudes $\\triangle n >0$  we assume that the results also hold for depletions. This is justified by our numerical results later in this letter. If we initialize our density field with a seeded blob of radius $\\ell$ and amplitude $\\triangle n$ as \n\\begin{align}\n  n(\\vec x, 0) &= n_0 + \\triangle n \\exp\\left( -\\frac{\\vec x^2}{2\\ell^2} \\right), \\label{eq:inita}\n \n \n\\end{align}\nand  \n$\\phi(\\vec x, 0 ) = 0$,\nwe immediately have $M := M(0) = 2\\pi \\ell^2 \\triangle n$, $E(0) = G(0) = 0$ and \n$S(0) = 2\\pi \\ell^2 f(\\triangle n)$, where $f(\\triangle n)$ captures the amplitude dependence of \nthe integral for $S(0)$. \n\nThe acceleration for both incompressible and compressible flows can be estimated\nby assuming a linear acceleration $V=A_0t$ and $X=A_0t^2/2$~\\cite{Held2016a} and using \n$E(t) = G(t)",
      "No differences to the results presented here were found. Initial perturbations on the particle density field are given by Eq.~\\eqref{eq:inita},\nwhere the perturbation amplitude $\\triangle n/n_0$ was chosen between $10^{-3}$ and $20$ for blobs and $-10^0$ and $ -10^{-3}$ for depletions. Due to computational reasons we show results only for $\\triangle n/n_0\\leq 20$. \n\n\nFor compressible flows we consider two different cases $\\ell/R_0 = 10^{-2}$ and\n$\\ell /R_0 = 10^{-3}$. \n For incompressible flows Eq.~\\eqref{eq:generala} and \\eqref{eq:vorticity}\n can be normalized such that the blob radius is absent from the equations~\\cite{Ott1978, Kube2012}. The simulations of incompressible flows can thus be used for both sizes. The numerical code as well as input parameters and output data can be found \nin the supplemental dataset to this contribution~\\cite{Data2017}. \\begin{figure}[htb]\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{com_blobs}\n    \\caption{\n      The maximum radial COM velocities of blobs for compressible and incompressible flows are shown. The continuous lines show Eq.~\\eqref{eq:vmax_theo} while the \n      dashed line shows the square root scaling Eq.~\\eqref{eq:sqrt} with \n      $\\mathcal Q = 0.32$ and $\\mathcal R=0.85$.\n    }\n    \\label{fig:com_blobs}\n\\end{figure} In Fig.~\\ref{fig:com_blobs} we plot the maximum COM velocity for blobs \nwith and without drift compression. For incompressible flows blobs follow the square root scaling almost \nperfectly. Only at very large amplitudes velocities are slightly below\nthe predicted values. For small amplitudes we observe that the compressible blobs follow\na linear scaling. When the amplitudes increase there is a transition to the\nsquare root scaling at around $\\triangle n/n_0 \\simeq 0.5$ for \n$\\ell/R_0=10^{-2}$ and $\\triangle n/n_0 \\simeq 0.05$ for $\\ell/R_0=10^{-3}$, which is consistent with Eq.~\\eqref{eq:vmax_theo} and Reference~\\cite{Kube2016}. In the transition regions the simulated velocities are slightly larger than the predicted ones from Eq.~\\eqref{eq:vmax_theo}."

      "To do so, we group digital assets using the 50 most common tags in our dataset (e.g. \"bnb-chain\", \"defi\", and \"collectibles-nfts\") and estimate the probability distributions of the median exponents \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 (Supplementary Figures ). These results show that design and purpose affect the dynamics of large price variations in the cryptocurrency market as the medians of typical exponents range from 2.4 to 3.7 among the groups. The lowest values occur for cryptocurrencies tagged as \"doggone-doggerel\" (medians of \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 are 2.38 and 2.83), \"memes\" (2.41 and 2.87), and \"stablecoin\" (2.65 and 2.79). Digital currencies belonging to the first two tags overlap a lot and have Dogecoin (DOGE, rank 9) and Shiba Inu (SHIB, rank 13) as the most important representatives. Cryptoassets with these tags usually have humorous characteristics (such as an Internet meme) and several have been considered as a form of pump-and-dump scheme , a type of financial fraud in which false statements artificially inflate asset prices so the scheme operators sell their overvalued cryptoassets. Conversely, cryptoassets tagged as \"stablecoin\" represent a class of cryptocurrencies designed to have a fixed exchange rate to a reference asset (such as a national currency or precious metal) . While the price of stablecoins tends to stay around the target values, their price series are also marked by sharp variations, which in turn are responsible for their typically small power-law exponents. This type of cryptoasset has been shown to be prone to failures , such as the recent examples of TerraUSD (UST) and Tron's USDD (USDD) that lost their pegs to the US Dollar producing large variations in their price series. The asymmetry between positive and negative large returns also emerges when grouping the cryptocurrencies using their tags. All 50 tags have distributions of \u03b1+ shifted to smaller values when compared with the distributions of \u03b1\u2212 , with differences between their medians ranging from \u22120.74 (\"okex-blockdream-ventures-portfolio\") to \u22120.14 (\"stablecoin\").",
      "Panels (c) and (d) show the distributions of these median exponents when considering the top 2000 and the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, respectively. We observe that the distributions of \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 tend to shift toward larger values when considering the largest cryptoassets. number of return observations (between 100 and 300 days) and filtering out cryptoassets with missing observations (Supplementary Figures ). Still, it is worth noticing the existence of a few cryptoassets (9 of them) with relatively small market capitalization (ranking below the top 1000) for which the power-law hypothesis is always rejected (Supplementary Table ). Having verified that large price movements in the cryptocurrency market are generally well-described by powerlaw distributions, we now focus on the power-law exponents that typically characterize each cryptoasset. To do so, we select all exponent estimates over the entire history of each digital asset for which the power-law hypothesis is not rejected and calculate their median values for both the positive ( \u03b1+ ) and negative ( \u03b1\u2212 ) returns. The dashed lines in Fig. ) show these median values for Bitcoin where \u03b1+ = 4.50 and \u03b1\u2212 = 2.99. It is worth noticing that the variance of large price movements \u03c3 2 is finite only for \u03b1 > 3, as the integral \u03c3 2 \u223c \u221e r min r 2 p(r)dr diverges outside this interval. Thus, while the typical variance of large positive returns is finite for Bitcoin, negative returns are at the limit of not having a typical scale and are thus susceptible to much larger variations. Figure shows the probability distribution for the median power-law exponents of all cryptoassets grouped by large positive and negative returns. We note that the distribution of typical power-law exponents associated with large positive returns is shifted to smaller values when compared with the distribution of exponents related to large negative returns. The medians of these typical exponents are respectively 2.78 and 3.11 for positive and negative returns."

      "A) The upregulation of the OA1 transgene is directly responsible for the observed changes in the expression of LTR-retrotransposons during starvation.",
      "B) The expression patterns of LTR-retrotransposons and the OA1 transgene are independent of each other and are both influenced by starvation-induced cellular stress.",
      "C) The upregulation of the OA1 transgene is correlated with the upregulation of LTR-retrotransposons, suggesting a potential shared regulatory mechanism or pathway.",
      "D) The downregulation of DNA transposons and L1 non-LTR retrotransposons during starvation is a compensatory mechanism to ensure the preferential upregulation of the OA1 transgene."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "In particular, Cluster 1 contains sequences that, similarly to the OA1 transgene, are progressively upregulated upon starvation (Fig 1A and 1C) , while Cluster 2 contains sequences that are upregulated at early time points. Interestingly, repeat families that are significantly enriched in these two clusters belong mostly to the group of LTR-retrotransposons, including ERV1, ERVK, ERVL, ERVL-MaLR and other LTR sequences (Fig 1D; S1A and S2A Figs). By contrast, DNA transposons (such as TcMar-Tigger) and L1 non-LTR retrotransposons are enriched among repeats that are downregulated during starvation, particularly at late time points (Clusters 3 and 4) (Fig 1D; S1A and S2A Figs). Consistent results were obtained by selecting significantly up- or downregulated genomic repeats (overall 181 species), based on their average expression out of three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h, when the transgene upregulation is more homogeneous) and controls, and on a P value <0.05 (S1B and S2B Figs). These findings suggest that EAA starvation induces genome-wide effects involving repetitive elements, and that\u2014among major repeat classes\u2014it upregulates in particular the expression of ERVs. In addition, to obtain a general overview of main gene pathways changing their expression together with the transgene during AA starvation, we performed gene expression and enrichment analyses of regular genes, by considering three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h) and controls. Differentially expressed genes were selected based on a P value <0.05 and a fold change between means of at least 2, and analyzed with the EnrichR tool . As shown in Fig 2 and S1 File, enrichment analyses against the KEGG and Reactome databases reveals a predominance of downregulated pathways, namely ribosome and translation, proteasome, AA metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and other pathways related to mitochondrial functions, which are affected in Huntington, Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html).",
      "To this aim, cells were cultured either in normal medium, or in absence of Met/Cys for different time points (6-15-30-72-120 hours), resulting in the progressive upregulation of the OA1 transgene during starvation (Fig 1A and 1B), consistent with previously published results . The expression of genomic repeats was determined according to RepeatMasker annotation and classification into classes, families, and subfamilies. Repeat species were then subjected to differential expression and enrichment analyses in starved vs control conditions. Out of 1396 annotated repeat subfamilies, 172 species displayed a differential expression profile during starvation. Fig 1. Exogenous transgene and endogenous retroviruses are upregulated in Met/Cys-deprived HeLa cells. (A,B) Exogenous integrated transgene (OA1) mRNA abundance in HeLa-OA1 cells, cultured in Met/Cys-deprived medium for the indicated time points, and analyzed by RNAseq (A), or RT-qPCR (B), compared to full medium. Data represent RPKM (A), or mean \u00b1 SD of 2 technical replicates, expressed as fold change vs. control (full medium at 6 h = 1) (B). (C) Clustering of 172 genomic repeat subfamilies, differentially expressed upon starvation, according to their expression profile. (D) Class distribution of repeat subfamilies belonging to differential expression clusters, compared to all genomic repeat subfamilies (first column). Class DNA includes DNA transposons; SINE includes Alu; LINE includes L1 an L2; LTR includes endogenous retroviruses and solitary LTRs; Satellite includes centromeric acrosomal and telomeric satellites; Others includes SVA, simple repeats, snRNA, and tRNAs. LTR-retroelements are significantly enriched among repeats that are upregulated upon starvation, while LINEs are significantly enriched among repeats that are downregulated. *P<0.05, ***P<0.001 (Fisher exact test). As shown in Fig 1C, the clustering of differentially expressed repeats, according to their expression pattern, reveals profiles comparable to the behavior of the transgene in the same conditions, i.e. upregulation upon starvation and no change in regular medium (Cluster 1 and 2)."

    "question": "Given the potential for gypsy moth outbreaks to cause significant defoliation and tree mortality, what is the most likely scenario that would lead to a resurgence of the gypsy moth population after a period of successful biological control using *Entomophaga maimaiga*?",
    "choices": [
      "A) A shift in the preferred host tree species of the gypsy moth.",
      "B) The development of resistance to *E. maimaiga* within the gypsy moth population.",
      "C) A prolonged period of drought conditions that hinder the growth and spread of *E. maimaiga*.",
      "D) Increased human intervention through the widespread use of chemical pesticides."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "Other favored tree species include apple, birch, poplar and willow. If the infestation is heavy, they will also attack certain conifers and other less favored species. The feeding causes extensive defoliation. Healthy trees can generally withstand one or two partial to one complete defoliation. Trees will regrow leaves before the end of the summer. Nonetheless, there can be die-back of branches. Older trees may become more vulnerable to stress after defoliation. Weakened trees can also be attacked by other organisms or lack energy reserves for winter dormancy and growth during the following spring. Three years of heavy defoliation may result in high oak mortality. The gypsy moth caterpillars drop leaf fragments and frass (droppings) while feeding creating a mess for decks, patios, outdoor furniture, cars and driveways. Crawling caterpillars can be a nuisance and their hairs irritating. The egg masses can be transported by vehicles to areas where the moth is not yet established. Under state quarantine laws, the CAES inspects certain plant shipments destined to areas free of the gypsy moth, particularly for egg masses. There are several ways to manage the gypsy moth: biological, physical and chemical. Biologically, the major gypsy moth control agent has been the fungus E. maimaiga. This fungus can provide complete control of the gypsy moth but is dependent on early season moisture from rains in May and June to achieve effective infection rates and propagation of the fungus to other caterpillars. The dry spring of 2015 resulted in little or no apparent fungal inoculation or spread until it killed late-stage caterpillars in some areas of the state, after most defoliation. Infected caterpillars hang vertically from the tree trunk, head down. Some die in an upside down \u201cV\u201d position, a characteristic of caterpillars killed by the less common gypsy moth nucleopolyhedrosis virus (NPV). This was not detected in caterpillars examined in 2015. Physical controls include removing and destroying egg masses, which can be drowned in a soapy water and disposed of.",
      "During the outbreak of 1989, CAES scientists discovered that an entomopathogenic fungus, Entomophaga maimaiga, was killing the caterpillars. Since then the fungus has been the most important agent suppressing gypsy moth activity. The fungus, however, cannot prevent all outbreaks and hotspots have been reported in some areas, in 2005-06 and again in 2015. The life cycle of the gypsy moth is one generation a year. Caterpillars hatch from buff-colored egg masses in late April to early May. An egg mass may contain 100 to more than 1000 eggs and are laid in several layers. The caterpillars (larvae) hatch a few days later and ascend the host trees and begin to feed on new leaves. The young caterpillars, buff to black-colored, lay down silk safety lines as they crawl and, as they drop from branches on these threads, they may be picked up on the wind and spread. There are four or five larval stages (instars) each lasting 4-10 days. Instars 1-3 remain in the trees. The fourth instar caterpillars, with distinctive double rows of blue and red spots, crawl up and down the tree trunks feeding mainly at night. They seek cool, shaded protective sites during the day, often on the ground. If the outbreak is dense, caterpillars may feed continuously and crawl at any time. With the feeding completed late June to early July, caterpillars seek a protected place to pupate and transform into a moth in about 10-14 days. Male moths are brown and fly. Female moths are white and cannot fly despite having wings. They do not feed and live for only 6-10 days. After mating, the female will lay a single egg mass and die. The egg masses can be laid anywhere: trees, fence posts, brick/rock walls, outdoor furniture, cars, recreational vehicles, firewood. The egg masses are hard. The eggs will survive the winter and larvae hatch the following spring during late April through early May. The impact of the gypsy moth can be extensive since the caterpillar will feed on a wide diversity of trees and shrubs. Oak trees are their preferred food."

It was in this very city that his illustrious father, the Mujaddid (Reviver) of Islam, Imam-e-Ahle Sunnat, A'la Hazrat, Ash Shah Imam Ahmed Raza Khan Al Qaderi (radi Allahu anhu) was born (1856 - 1921). At the time of the birth of Ghousul Waqt, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu), his distinguished father, was in Mahrerah Shareef, one of the great spiritual centers of the Sunni World. On that very night, Sayyiduna A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu) dreamt that he had been blessed with a son and in his dream he named his son \"Aale Rahmaan\". Hazrat Makhdoom Shah Abul Hussain Ahmadi Noori (radi Allahu anhu), one of the great personalities of Mahrerah Shareef, named the child \"Abul Barkaat Muhiy'yuddeen Jilani\". Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was later named \"Mustapha Raza Khan\". His Aqiqa was done on the name of \"Muhammad\", which was the tradition of the family. Upon the birth of Ghousul Waqt, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) Sayyiduna Shah Abul Hussain Ahmadi Noori (radi Allahu anhu) told A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu), \"Maulana! When I come to Bareilly Shareef, then I will definitely see this child. He is a very blessed child. \"\nAs promised, when Sayyiduna Abul Hussain Ahmadi Noori (radi Allahu anhu) went to Bareilly Shareef, he immediately summoned to see Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) who was only six (6) months old. Sayyiduna Noori Mia (radi Allahu anhu), as he was also famously known, congratulated A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu) and said, \"This child will be of great assistance to the Deen and through him the servants of Almighty Allah will gain great benefit. This child is a Wali. From his blessed sight thousands of stray Muslims will become firm on the Deen. He is a sea of blessings. \"\nOn saying this, Sayyiduna Noori Mia (radi Allahu anhu) placed his blessed finger into the mouth of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and made him a Mureed.",
      "He is the great grandson of A'la Hazrat, Shaikh Imam Ahmed Raza Fazil-e Barelvi (rahmatullahi alaih), the Mujaddid (Reviver) of Islam in the 14th Century Hijri. Under the tutorship of renowned Ulama, he attained the degree of Fazile Deeniyat (Graduation in Islamic Theology) from Darul Uloom Manzare Islam, Bareilly. After spending three years (1963 - 1966) at the Al Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt, his Eminence post-graduated in Arabic Literature and Deeniyat with specialization in Ahadith (Prophetic Tradition) and Tafseer (Quranic Exegesis) with high distinctions. On his return home, he joined Darul Uloom Manzare Islam, Bareilly Shareef. Thereafter, he left the Darul Uloom and established his own Darul-Ifta with the permission of his maternal grandfather, Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam Hind, Shaikh Mufti Muhammad Mustapha Raza Khan (rahmatullahi alaih). His Eminence, Mufti-e-Azam Hind (rahmatullahi alaih) declared him his Ja'Nashin (Successor) while the great Shaikh was present in this world. His Eminence inherited the skill in the issuing of Fatawa (Legal Islamic Rulings) and in tackling the complex issues relating to Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence) directly from Mufti-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu) who inherited it directly from Mujaddid-e-Deen-o-Millat, Ash Shah Imam Ahmed Raza Bareilvi (rahmatullahi alaih). He is not only the Successor and a trustworthy custodian of Fatawa writing of Shaikh Mufti-e-Azam Hind (rahmatullahi alaih), but also the custodian of learning, knowledge, sanctity and saintliness, of his grandfather, Hujjatul Islam, Moulana Muhammad Haamid Raza Khan (rahmatullahi alaihi). His father, Moulana Muhammad Ibrahim Raza Khan Jilaani Mia (rahmatullahi alaih), was a great Aalim and Saint. He was well-versed in the commentary of the Holy Quran and so was given the title of Mufassir-e-Azam-e-Hind or Great Commentator of the Holy Quran in India. His Eminence, Mufti Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari, travels extensively propagating the Deen and is a world-renowned preacher and a spiritual guide."

Still with no errors, a trivial cost for implementing the cryptographic function (oracle) would bring the cost down to about $2^{38}$ oracle calls per quantum computer. Keeping the actual function implementation, but adding the fault-tolerant layer with a physical error rate of $10^{-7}$ (with appropriate assumptions and using state-of-the-art quantum error correction) pushes the cost up to around $2^{76}$ surface code cycles per quantum computer (where now each code cycle is assumed to have unit cost). Similar remarks hold for the remaining plots in this manuscript. \\includegraphics[width=0.429\\textwidth]{figures/AES-128_time.pdf}\n      \t\\captionof{figure}{AES-128 block cipher.

Odd, because it turns on a formal classification instead of on Congress\u2019s practical ability to fix the problem.

      "Either way it\u2019s hard to justify our natural reactions to injustice, suffering, and death. But let\u2019s forget about consistency and get to work: what problems can we name and how do we fix them? If the problem is society, the cure is social change. If the problem is pride, the cure is humility. If the problem is bad decisions, the cure is right decisions. If the problem is lack of love, the cure is love. If the problem is a broken relationship, the cure is forgiveness. If the problem is rebellion, the cure is submission. If the problem is demons, the cure is their destruction. If the problem is illusion, the cure is truth. If the problem is original sin, the cure is death of the old self. If the problem is doubt, the cure is faith. If the problem is in every part of us, the cure is a new creation. If the problem is death, the cure is eternal life. Of course this just scratches the surface. But what I want you to notice is that for all of these problems, Christianity offers the solution. And for all of these problems, the solution is the same: that one seed of woman that God promised, the One to come that would crush the serpent. His name is Jesus. Some of these things were addressed in His first coming, when He died on the cross for our sins and rose to life to offer us eternal life. But the work isn\u2019t done yet. He\u2019s coming back to finish the work, to make all things new. Think about that. We\u2019ll explain further another time. As a wise poet named Tom once wrote, the waiting is the hardest part. If we as Christians are a new creation (we are), have eternal life (we do), are filled with the Holy Spirit (yup), and are no longer slaves to sin (seriously!), then why is the world still messed up? And more to the point, why are WE still messed up? Frankly, we still suffer the effects of sin in all our faculties. Our wills have been freed from slavery, but they\u2019re still polluted. We won\u2019t be fully free from the effects of sin until Jesus comes back. So we\u2019re no longer slaves, but we\u2019re still polluted and live in a polluted world.",
      "It took a long time to get there. No, extreme depravity wasn\u2019t the result of the Fall, but total depravity still is. Total depravity is the doctrine that says sin bent every part of man. Sin pollutes man\u2019s reason, man\u2019s emotions, man\u2019s willpower, man\u2019s desires, man\u2019s imagination, man\u2019s memories, man\u2019s senses, man\u2019s body, and even man\u2019s conscience. Nothing is safe. Nothing is pure. And this is intimately wrapped up in the image of God. Remember that man was made in God\u2019s image, unique among all creation. But sin now pollutes that image. It\u2019s still present\u2014we still can\u2019t help but \u201cimage\u201d our Creator when we act rationally, make wise decisions, love others selflessly, and so on. Instead the image is defaced but not erased. What should normally reflect God\u2019s character instead reflects a mixture of good and evil. Comparing Theories\nNow if we take a step back, we all recognize that we live in a broken world. Very few people would argue that everything is perfect, that sin, suffering, and death somehow don\u2019t exist or aren\u2019t really bad. We (generally) all agree that there\u2019s a problem. But there\u2019s little agreement about why it is the way it is. People who don\u2019t believe in a literal Adam and Even tanking the human race are generally stuck. For example, if you only believe in the natural world, evil is just a part of nature. Death is a part of life. Suffering is a biochemical response to destructive conditions. And if you\u2019re just one organism out of millions competing for resources, all you can really say is that you don\u2019t like these things. They are distasteful. Maybe you\u2019re hard-wired to show empathy with others because of some evolutionary imperative, but objectively speaking what can you say? Well, you can say lots I suppose, but you can\u2019t be consistent without ending up a nihilist. Other religions have the same problem: either evil belongs as some part of the bigger cosmic plan or it\u2019s an illusion. Either way, it\u2019s hard to take evil seriously. Either it belongs in some way, or it doesn\u2019t exist at all."

    "documentation": [
      "By January of 1870, a tablet honoring him was affixed to the house they believed to have been his residence while in London, No. 7 Craven Street in the Strand on the west side of the street.[28] A majority of historians writing about Franklin in the nineteenth and early twentieth century placed him at No. 7: O. L. Holley, The Life of Benjamin Franklin (1848); E. M. Tomkinson, Benjamin Franklin (1885); John Torrey Morse, Benjamin Franklin (1891); Paul Elmer More, Benjamin Franklin (1900); John S. C. Abbot, Benjamin Franklin (1903); Sydney George Fisher, The True Benjamin Franklin (1903). A notable exception is D. H. Montgomery\u2019s His Life Written by Himself published in 1896. He has Franklin at No. 27 Craven Street. It seems then that depending upon the source, Franklin was thought to have lived at either No. 7 or No. 27, but not both, the overwhelming majority favoring No. 7. As late as 2011, Franklin is still mentioned as living at No. 7.[29]\nIn 1913, No. 7 was scheduled to be torn down. An article in the March 1914 edition of The Book News Monthly, describes the situation:\nAs is well known to informed American pilgrims, it has been possible for all admirers of the famous philosopher and statesman to pay their respects to his memory before that house, No. 7 Craven Street, just off the Strand, which was his chief home during his two sojourns in the British capital, but even as these lines are being written the London newspapers are recording that that interesting shrine is soon to be pulled down to make room for a restaurant. It is some mitigation of this misfortune to remember that at the most the Craven Street house was nothing more than a reproduction of the one in which Franklin had his suite of four rooms, for the structure has been rebuilt since Franklin\u2019s time. When, then, some one makes a piteous plea that at least the philosopher\u2019s bedroom shall be preserved, the soothing answer is that the apartment in question is only a replica of that in which the illustrious American enjoyed his well-earned slumbers in 1757-62 and 1764-75.",
      "An examination of the Westminster Rate Books for the years 1774 and 1775 reveal them living not at No. 7 on the west side of Craven Street as one might expect from the overwhelming consensus of nineteenth century guidebooks and biographies, but surprisingly at No. 1.[48] The controversy of No. 7 being torn down was all for naught as it had never been Franklin\u2019s residence. Sir George was correct on that point. Unfortunately, No. 1 was torn down as well in the early part of the twentieth century. The first time No. 1 is mentioned as Franklin\u2019s second residence is in the Survey of London: Volume 18, St Martin-in-The-Fields II: the Strand published by the London County Council in 1937, ironically the same County Council that had declared No. 36 as Franklin\u2019s only residence twenty-four years earlier. From 1748 until 1772 Margaret \u2018Stephenson\u2019 occupied this house [No. 27 (36)], and it was there that Benjamin Franklin settled after his arrival in London in 1757 as Agent to the General Assembly of Pennsylvania \u2026 In October, 1772, Mrs. Stevenson and Franklin removed to No. 1, Craven Street (now demolished), and No. 36 was for the next two years occupied by William Hewson, surgeon, who had married Mary Stevenson.[49] In the spring of 1774, William Hewson died unexpectedly of septicemia two weeks after cutting himself while dissecting a cadaver. Polly was left to care for their two young sons and was pregnant with a daughter she would give birth to in August of the same year. Is it possible that Margaret and Benjamin moved back into No. 27 to assist Polly after the death of her husband as suggested in The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin?[50]\nIf the Westminster Rate Books are to be believed, the answer is no. For the year 1774, the Rate Books list Margaret Stevenson at No. 1 and William Hewson at No. 27. For the year 1775, they list Margaret Stevenson at No. 1 and Magnus Falkner (Falconer/Falconar) at No. 27. Magnus was William\u2019s assistant at the anatomy school and fianc\u00e9 to William\u2019s sister, Dorothy."

      "The estimation of the in-control and out-of-control ARLs of the CUSUM-OAL tests and their comparison are given in Section 3. The detection performances of the three CUSUM-OAL tests and the conventional CUSUM test are illustrated in Section 4 by comparing their numerical out-ofcontrol ARLs. Section 5 provides some concluding remarks. Proofs of the theorems are given in the Appendix. AN OPTIMAL SLR TEST, TWO CUSUM-OAL TESTS AND THEIR LIMITING RELATIONSHIPS\n\nLet P 0 and E 0 denote the probability and the expectation respectively with the probability density p v 0 when there is no change for all the time. It is known that It follows from Proposition 2.38 in and (5.8)-(5.9) in Chow et al, P.108) that the following sequence test of sum of logarithmic likelihood ratio (SLR)\nfor B > 1, is optimal in the following sense min for P 0 (T SLR < \u221e) = \u03b1, where c = log B and 0 < \u03b1 < 1. In particular, if P 0 is the standard normal distribution with mean shift \u00b5 > 0 after changepoint, we have Z j \u2212 \u00b5 0 = \u00b5X j , where \u00b5 0 = \u2212\u00b5 2 /2. It follows from proposition 4 in that the SLR test T SLR in (4) is also optimal (minimal ARL 1 ) with the same false alarm probability P 0 (T < \u03c4 ). It can be seen that the in-control average run length of T SLR is infinite, that is, ARL 0 = E 0 (T SLR ) = \u221e. However, the minimal ARL 1 with finite ARL 0 is a widely used optimality criterion in statistical quality control (see ) and detection of abrupt changes (see . In order to get finite ARL 0 for T SLR , we replace the constant control limit c of T SLR in (3) or (4) with the dynamic control limit n(\u00b5 0 \u2212 r) and obtain a modified SLR test T SLR (r) in the following\nfor r \u2265 0. For comparison, the in-control ARL 0 of all candidate sequential tests are constrained to be equal to the same desired level of type I error, the test with the lowest out-of-control ARL v has the highest power or the fastest monitoring (detection) speed. In the following example 1, the numerical simulations of the out-of-control ARLs of the CUSUM-OAL tests T C (cg u,0 ) in detecting the mean shifts of observations with normal distribution will be compared with that of the SLR tests T * (r) and T * (0), and that of the CUSUM-SLR test T C (c) \u2227 T * (0) := min{T C (c), T * (0)} in the following Table .",
      "By the renewal property of the CUSUM test T C we have , where E 1 (T C ) is the out-of-control average run length (ARL 1 ), P k and E k denote the probability and expectation respectively when the change from p v 0 to p v 1 occurs at the change-point \u03c4 = k for k \u2265 1. Though we know that the CUSUM test is optimal under Lorden's measure (see Moustakides 1986 and Ritov 1990), the out-of-control ARL 1 of the CUSUM test is not small, especially in detecting small mean shifts ( see Table in Section 4). In other words, the CUSUM test is insensitive in detecting small mean shifts. Then, how to increase the sensitivity of the CUSUM test ? Note that the control limit in the CUSUM test is a constant c which does not depend on the observation samples. Intuitively, if the control limit of the CUSUM test can become low as the samples mean of the observation sequence increases, then the alarm time of detecting the increasing mean shifts will be greatly shortened. Based on this idea, by selecting a decreasing function g(x) we may define the ( upper-sided ) CUSUM chart T C (cg) with the observation-adjusted control limits cg( \u1e90n ) ( abbreviated to the CUSUM-OAL chart ) in the following where c > 0 is a constant and \u1e90n = n i=1 Z i /n. In other words, the control limits cg( \u1e90n ) of the CUSUM-OAL test can be adjusted adaptively according to the observation information { \u1e90n }. Note that the control limits cg( \u1e90n ) may be negative. In the special case, the CUSUM-OAL chart T C (cg) becomes into the conventional CUSUM chart T C (c) in (1) when g \u2261 1. Similarly, we can define a down-sided CUSUM-OAL test. In this paper, we consider only the upper-sided CUSUM-OAL test since the properties of the down-sided CUSUM-OAL test can be obtained by the similar method. The main purpose of the present paper is to show the good detection performance of the CUSUM-OAL test and to give the estimation of its the in-control and out-of-control ARLs. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we first present an optimal SLR sequential test, then define two sequences of the CUSUM-OAL tests and prove that one of the two sequences of CUSUM-OAL tests converges to the optimal test, another sequences of CUSUM-OAL tests converges to a combination of the optimal test and the CUSUM test."

      "They knew what was coming! We need water to live! Without water, we will die! Even if we have water for today, we will need water again tomorrow! We can drink until we are satisfied, only to know that we will eventually be thirsty for more. The gospel of John tells a story about a woman who gave up on this question all together. She moved beyond wondering if the Lord was really with her, so confident God had forgotten her that she gave up wondering at all. Born a Samaritan into a world that valued other bodies as better than her body: male bodies, Jewish bodies, even married bodies. Even after encountering Jesus, she still leaves their conversation without a name, numbered as one of many, simply called, \u201cSamaritan woman.\u201d She too, was thirsty. Most believe that her shame led her to drink water in the heat of the day, when no one else would be at the rocky well, when she could get a drink alone, without experiencing the stigma and stares of others. When she came to get a drink, Jesus was also at the well, thirsty himself and in need of rest and water from the long journey through Samaria. The Israelites complaint for water sends Moses to the only one who can satisfy, the only one who can meet this need. Moses turns to God, \u201cWhat should I do with these people? How can I satisfy their thirst? I\u2019ve looked around, I\u2019ve checked far and wide, turned the house upsidedown, looked under the seats of the car, at the bottle of every bottle, I\u2019ve even looked for dew on the ground and under the lids of jars and there is no water to be found. Where do we go for water? Is the Lord really with us or not? The Israelites who wrote down this story and allowed the ancestors to look like desperate complainers who doubted God and tested God, they were onto something. They knew that we are thirsty people. Jesus knew also. All who are thirsty, come! All who believe in me, drink this living water! We are desperate to feel God\u2019s presence, to be bathed in the water of the Spirit, to know that this is not all there is, to feel a sense of belonging to the One who is greater than I.",
      "We can only make it so long in the desert, so long wandering from one trial to the next, without a drink. And yet, Jesus also says, \u201cBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. Notice with me: not blessed are those who are righteous, but those who thirst for righteousness. Not blessed are those who are righteous, but those who thirst for righteousness. Blessed are those who thirst for relationship with God, to know God, to see God. I wonder, \u201cDoes Jesus want us to keep wanting?\u201d Does Jesus want us to keep thirsting? Many faithful followers of Jesus throughout history have never claimed their thirst was quenched, never fully satisfied. You know that moment when you quench your thirst, when you sigh with relief when your throat is at ease once again, that\u2019s the opposite of how many of God\u2019s children have described the life of faith. They describe wanting more, being satisfied at times, while knowing they will be thirsty again. What will be waiting for you at the rock? Will the water gush out, bursting forth, covering you from head to toe with God\u2019s presence, drenching you in hope, cleansing you from the dust that\u2019s caked to your feet and renewing you for a new day, a new hour, a new moment basking in the presence of God? What will be waiting for you at the rock? Will the water drip slowly, quenching your thirst for but a moment, giving you just a glimpse of God\u2019s spirit? Will it be so hard to get the water from the rock, that you\u2019ll have to bend down, get underneath that dripping water to try and catch a drop? Will it be just enough for you to know, if only for a moment, that God is really with you? Will it be just enough to satisfy you for this hour, but keep you coming back for more?\nWhat will be waiting for you at the rock? What if it seems like the water has run out, like there isn\u2019t a drop left, the way that Mother Teresa described? What then? We follow her example. She still goes to the rock, over and over again, not to get water quench her own thirst, but to relieve the thirst of God\u2019s other children."

      "Sir Simon William English  (born 30 December 1961) is a New Zealand former National Party politician who served as the 39th prime minister of New Zealand from 2016 to 2017. He had previously served as the 17th deputy prime minister of New Zealand and minister of finance from 2008 to 2016 under John Key and the Fifth National Government. A farmer and public servant before entering politics, English was elected to the New Zealand Parliament in  as the National Party's candidate in the Wallace electorate. He was elevated to Cabinet in 1996 and in 1999 was made minister of finance, although he served for less than a year due to his party's loss at the 1999 general election. In October 2001, English replaced Jenny Shipley as the leader of the National Party (and consequently as Leader of the Opposition). He led the party to its worst defeat at the 2002 general election, and as a consequence, in October 2003 he was replaced as leader by Don Brash. In November 2006, after Brash's resignation, English became deputy leader under John Key. After National's victory at the 2008 general election, he became deputy prime minister and was also made minister of finance for the second time. Under English's direction New Zealand's economy maintained steady growth during National's three terms of government. He became a list-only MP after stepping down as an electorate MP at the 2014 general election. John Key resigned as leader of the National Party and prime minister in December 2016. English won the resulting leadership election unopposed and was sworn in as prime minister on 12 December 2016. His tenure was only ten months, and included a three-month election campaign. In the 2017 general election, National won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority. The parties holding the balance of power declined to support the existing government, and English was subsequently replaced as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern, leader of the Labour Party. English initially continued on as Leader of the Opposition, but resigned as leader of the National Party on 27 February 2018 and left parliament two weeks later.",
      "At the 2008 election, English was re-elected by his electorate, winning by a margin of about 15,500 votes. He became Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and Minister of Finance in the fifth National Government, being sworn into office on 19 November 2008 and continued to serve in those roles until becoming Prime Minister on 12 December 2014. He was also made Minister of Infrastructure in National's first term of government and Minister responsible for Housing New Zealand Corporation and minister responsible for the New Zealand flag consideration process in its third. He was comfortably re-elected in Clutha-Southland in the 2011 election but opted to run as a party-list candidate in 2014. The pairing of John Key as leader of the National Party and English as his deputy has been compared to that of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating (in Australia) and Tony Blair and Gordon Brown (in the UK). English acceded to the role of Finance Minister in the continuing wake of the financial crisis. In response to New Zealand's rising debt, English made budget deficit-reduction his main priority. His first budget outlined three focuses in New Zealand's financial recovery: \"improving the business environment and removing roadblocks to growth; investment in productive infrastructure; and improving the way government works\". One of his first acts was creating the National Infrastructure Unit, charged with formulating a plan for infrastructure projects and investments. He commissioned a government-wide spending review, with an aim to reducing government expenditure\u2014with the exceptions of a two-year stimulus package and long-term increases on infrastructure spending. In April 2011, the Opposition criticised English for suggesting that New Zealand businesses could use New Zealand's low wages to help it compete with Australia. The National Government campaigned for re-election in 2011 on its economic record. The Government boasted growth for five consecutive quarters up to mid-2010, totalling 1.6% of real GDP."

      "Although\nC$_2$H was previously observed in low-mass cores and Photon Dominated\nRegions (e.g., \\citealt{millar1984,jansen1995}), so far it was not\nsystematically investigated in the framework of high-mass star\nformation.\n\n\\section{Observations}\n\\label{obs}\n\nThe 21 massive star-forming regions were observed with the Atacama\nPathfinder Experiment (APEX) in the 875\\,$\\mu$m window in fall 2006. We observed 1\\,GHz from 338 to 339\\,GHz and 1\\,GHz in the image\nsideband from 349 to 350\\,GHz. The spectral resolution was\n0.1\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$, but we smoothed the data to\n$\\sim$0.9\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$. The average system temperatures were around\n200\\,K, each source had on-source integration times between 5 and 16\nmin. The data were converted to main-beam temperatures with forward\nand beam efficiencies of 0.97 and 0.73, respectively\n\\citep{belloche2006}. The average $1\\sigma$ rms was 0.4\\,K.  The main\nspectral features of interest are the C$_2$H lines around 349.4\\,GHz\nwith upper level excitation energies $E_u/k$ of 42\\,K (line blends of\nC$_2$H$(4_{5,5}-3_{4,4})$ \\& C$_2$H$(4_{5,4}-3_{4,3})$ at\n349.338\\,GHz, and C$_2$H$(4_{4,4}-3_{3,3})$ \\&\nC$_2$H$(4_{4,3}-3_{3,2})$ at 349.399\\,GHz). The beam size was $\\sim\n18''$.\n\nThe original Submillimeter Array (SMA) C$_2$H data toward the\nHMPO\\,18089-1732 were first presented in \\citet{beuther2005c}. There\nwe used the compact and extended configurations resulting in good\nimages for all spectral lines except of C$_2$H. For this project, we\nre-worked on these data only using the compact configuration. Because\nthe C$_2$H emission is distributed on larger scales (see\n\\S\\ref{results}), we were now able to derive a C$_2$H image. The\nintegration range was from 32 to 35\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$, and the achieved\n$1\\sigma$ rms of the C$_2$H image was 450\\,mJy\\,beam$^{-1}$.  For more\ndetails on these observations see \\citet{beuther2005c}. \\section{Results}\n\\label{results}\n\nThe sources were selected to cover all evolutionary stages from IRDCs\nvia HMPOs to UCH{\\sc ii}s. We derived our target list from the samples\nof \\citet{klein2005,fontani2005,hill2005,beltran2006}.",
      "Therefore, we\nwent back to a dataset obtained with the Submillimeter Array toward\nthe hypercompact H{\\sc ii} region IRAS\\,18089-1732 with a much higher\nspatial resolution of $\\sim 1''$ \\citep{beuther2005c}. Albeit this\nhypercompact H{\\sc ii} region belongs to the class of HMPOs, it is\nalready in a relatively evolved stage and has formed a hot core with a\nrich molecular spectrum. \\citet{beuther2005c} showed the spectral\ndetection of the C$_2$H lines toward this source, but they did not\npresent any spatially resolved images. To recover large-scale\nstructure, we restricted the data to those from the compact SMA\nconfiguration (\\S\\ref{obs}). With this refinement, we were able to\nproduce a spatially resolved C$_2$H map of the line blend at\n349.338\\,GHz with an angular resolution of $2.9''\\times 1.4''$\n(corresponding to an average linear resolution of 7700\\,AU at the\ngiven distance of 3.6\\,kpc). Figure \\ref{18089} presents the\nintegrated C$_2$H emission with a contour overlay of the 860\\,$\\mu$m\ncontinuum source outlining the position of the massive protostar. In\ncontrast to almost all other molecular lines that peak along with the\ndust continuum \\citep{beuther2005c}, the C$_2$H emission surrounds the\ncontinuum peak in a shell-like fashion.\n\n\\section{Discussion and Conclusions}\n\nTo understand the observations, we conducted a simple chemical\nmodeling of massive star-forming regions. A 1D cloud model with a mass\nof 1200\\,M$_\\sun$, an outer radius of 0.36\\,pc and a power-law density\nprofile ($\\rho\\propto r^p$ with $p=-1.5$) is the initially assumed\nconfiguration. Three cases are studied: (1) a cold isothermal cloud\nwith $T=10$\\,K, (2) $T=50$\\,K, and (3) a warm model with a temperature\nprofile $T\\propto r^q$ with $q=-0.4$ and a temperature at the outer\nradius of 44\\,K. The cloud is illuminated by the interstellar UV\nradiation field (IRSF, \\citealt{draine1978}) and by cosmic ray\nparticles (CRP). The ISRF attenuation by single-sized $0.1\\mu$m\nsilicate grains at a given radius is calculated in a plane-parallel\ngeometry following \\citet{vandishoeck1988}."

The total sign factor \u03c3( ) \u2208 {\u00b11} is explicitly calculated for every configuration. We apply sign reweighting as the dual formulation has a mild sign problem: baryons are non-relativistic and usually have loop geometries that have a positive signs. The dual partition function of the strong coupling limit is simulated with the worm algorithm (see Section III A) and the sign problem is essentially solved in this limit. Extension to finite \u03b2\n\nThe leading order gauge corrections O(\u03b2) to the strong coupling limit are obtained by expanding the Wilson gauge action Eq. ( ) before integrating out the gauge links. A formal expression is obtained by changing the order of integration (first gauge links, then Grassmann-valued fermions) within the QCD partition function:\nWith this the O (\u03b2) partition function is The challenge in computing Z (1) is to address the SU(N c ) integrals that receive contributions from the elementary plaquette U P .",
      "Since the strong coupling regime does not have a well defined lattice spacing, we also determine the baryon mass am B to set the parameters of the grand-canonical partition function, aT and a\u00b5 B , in units of am B . We conclude by discussing the resulting nuclear interactions, and compare our findings with other results. Staggered action of strong coupling QCD and its dual representation\n\nIn the strong coupling regime, the gauge integration is performed first, followed by the Grassmann integration to obtain a dual formulation. This was pioneered for the strong coupling limit in and has been extended by one of us to include gauge corrections . The sign problem is mild in the strong coupling limit and still under control for \u03b2 < 1, where we can apply sign reweighting. The dual degrees of freedom are color-singlet mesons and baryons, which are point-like in the strong coupling limit, and become extended about a lattice spacing by incorporating leading order gauge corrections. The partition function of lattice QCD is given by where DU is the Haar measure, U \u2208 SU(3) are the gauge fields on the lattice links (x, \u03bc) and { \u03c7x , \u03c7 x } are the unrooted staggered fermions at the lattice sites x. The gauge action S G [U] is given by the Wilson plaquette action and the staggered fermion action S F [ \u03c7, \u03c7, U] is: where the gauge action depends on the inverse gauge coupling \u03b2 = 2Nc g 2 and the fermion action depends on the quark chemical potential a\u00b5 q which favors quarks in the positive temporal direction, and the bare quark mass am q . First we consider the strong coupling limit where the inverse gauge coupling \u03b2=0 and hence the gauge action S G [U] drops out from the partition function in this limit. The gauge integration is over terms depending only on the individual links (x, \u03bc) so the partition function factorizes into a product of one-link integrals and we can write it as:\nwith z(x, \u03bc) the one-link gauge integral that can be eval-uated from invariant integration, as discussed in , where we write the one-link integral in terms of new hadronic variables: Only terms of the form (M (x)M (y))"

      "D) The functional hierarchy in both macaque and mouse visual cortices is primarily determined by the number of trainable parameters in the neural network models."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "documentation": [
      "To figure out the distinctions in the functional hierarchy between macaques and mice, for each cortical region, we obtain the normalized depth of the layer that achieves the highest similarity score in each model. Then, we divide models (excluding vision transformers) into two groups based on their depths and conduct investigations on these two groups separately. A nonparametric ANOVA is applied to each group for testing whether layer depths change significantly across cortical regions. For mouse visual cortex (Figure (a)), taking the deep model group as an example, ANOVA shows overall significant changes in depth across cortical regions for TSVD-Reg and RSA (Friedman's \u03c7 2 = 49.169,\np = 2.0 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ; \u03c7 2 = 19.455, p = 0.002). But there is no significant change for SVCCA (\u03c7 2 = 8.689, p = 0.122). According to these results, the differences in depth across regions are indeterminacy and irregular. Meanwhile, the trends of layer depth between some regions contradict the hierarchy observed in physiological experiments of mice (those between VISp and VISrl for TSVD-Reg and between VISal and VISpm for RSA). However, for macaque visual cortex (Figure (b)), there are significant differences (t = \u22125.451, p = 6.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ; t = \u22128.312, p = 2.8 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ; t = \u22123.782, p = 6.9 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , also taking the deep model group as an example) between V4 and IT, and the trend is consistent with the information processing hierarchy in primate visual cortex. The comparative analyses of the best layer depths of the shallow and deep model groups also exhibit the differences between macaques and mice. For mouse visual cortex, the best layer depths of shallow models are significantly higher than those of deep models. Compared to deep models, most shallow models achieve the top similarity scores in intermediate and even later layers. Differently, for macaque visual cortex, the depth of models has little effect on the depth of the most similar layer. What's more, we find that the most similar layer of mouse visual cortex always occurs after the 28 \u00d7 28 feature map is downsampled to 14 \u00d7 14, which leads to the layer depths' difference between shallow and deep models.",
      "Nevertheless, the best layer of macaque IT appears in the last part of networks, where the feature map has been downsampled more times. In summary, our results might reveal two distinctions in the functional hierarchy between macaques and mice. First, there is a distinct functional hierarchical structure of macaque ventral visual pathway, while there might be no clear sequential functional hierarchy in mouse visual cortex. One explanation is that the mouse visual cortex is organized into a parallel structure and the function of mouse cortical regions are more generalized and homogeneous than those of macaques. Another possibility would be that even though the sequential relations exist among mouse cortical regions as proposed in anatomical and physiological work, they are too weak for the current deep neural networks to capture. Additionally, mice perform more complex visual tasks than expected with a limited brain capacity . Consequently, the neural responses of mouse visual cortex may contain more information not related to object recognition that neural networks focus on. Secondly, it is well known that the units in the neural networks get larger receptive fields after downsampling, and through the analyses of differences between two groups of models based on depth, we find the feature map of the best layer for mouse is downsampled fewer times than that for macaque. Based on these results, we provide computational evidence that the increased ratio of the receptive field size in cortical regions across the mouse visual pathway is smaller than those across the macaque visual pathways, which echoes some physio- Macaque-Face dataset --- Table : The correlation between the similarity scores and the number of parameters. r is Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. \"-\" indicates that there is no significant correlation. To explore the processing mechanisms in the visual cortex of macaques and mice, we investigate the model properties from the whole to the details. As shown in Table and 2, we first measure the correlation between the similarity scores and the sizes (i.e. the number of trainable parameters and the depth) of network models."

      "Tightening up petroleum tax\nThis unexpected prosperity undoubtedly created some jealously in the neighbouring local authorities, and the media began to show an interest in the issue. Local daily Stavanger Aftenblad interviewed Sola\u2019s chief executive and controller in 1981, when its photographer took a shot which illustrated the boundless wealth \u2013 Torstensb\u00f8 stood showering hundred-krone notes over his colleague. This story was not only read by the paper\u2019s regular subscribers. The following day, 150 copies were distributed to members of the Storting (parliament). That in turn prompted Centre Party representative Lars Velsand to make a passionate speech in which he described the position as a misuse of tax revenues. He called on the government to intervene so that individual local authorities were unable to benefit in this way. Nor was he alone in finding it unreasonable that a small community like Sola should get so much money. The result was an amendment to the Petroleum Tax Act on 11 June 1982, which specified that the proceeds from the agio tax should be transferred in future to central government.

Foto: Norsk Fly og Flyfoto/Norsk Oljemuseum Unfortunately, however, Sola had got used to consuming these revenues. It is easy to learn expensive habits, but not so straightforward to shrug them off again. Matters had become a little unusual when the council\u2019s executive board adopted the style of the oil company chiefs and took a helicopter outing during an ordinary budget meeting.[REMOVE]Fotnote: Oskar Goa, former chief technical officer in Sola local authority, interviewed by Kristin \u00d8ye Gjerde, 23 October 2000. However, most of the tax money benefitted the general public. Paying for Sola upper secondary school and new national and county highways is an example of this. The council also invested on local authority school buildings and community facilities such as the big sports complex at \u00c5sen, with an outdoor athletics ground and two modern indoor arenas.",
      "Dysjaland and Tananger also acquired new sports arenas. A new cultural centre built in central Sola has a distinctive architecture in brick and glass, with a grassed roof to blend with the surrounding J\u00e6ren landscape. With two stages and a public library, this became the community\u2019s main venue for events and so forth. The local authority thereby built up a very good infrastructure. Power cables were laid in the same trenches as water and sewage pipes, a network of cycle lanes was built and street lighting installed. On the downside, virtually all these investments boosted operating expenses. The council\u2019s running costs rose by an annual average of 30 per cent in 1978-84, with the biggest growth in the last three years of the period. So the calls by Storting representatives to transfer agio tax receipts from councils to central government represented a real threat to local politicians. Sola joined forces with other local authorities in the same position, including Stavanger, Oslo and B\u00e6rum as well as Rogaland county council. A delegation met the Storting\u2019s standing committee on finance to present their case, and secured a commitment to accept a phased reduction in revenues over four years. The local authorities would receive 80 per cent of agio tax receipts during the first year, then 60 per cent, 40 per cent and finally 20 per cent.[REMOVE]Fotnote: Amendment to the Petroleum Tax Act adopted on 14 May 1982. In reality, however, the run-down percentages were adjusted to extend over five years in annual steps of 80, 60, 20, 20 and 20 per cent. The total amount going to the local authorities was the same. The arrangement was controversial to the last, and also uncertain because it had to be approved in each annual government budget. Living within its means\nAfter the tax change, Sola\u2019s chief executive officer saw the writing on the wall. It seemed \u201cto be unquestionable that [Sola] has seen its best days in purely financial terms and must return to setting tougher priorities for various assignments,\u201d he asserted in connection with the budget process for 1983.[REMOVE]Fotnote: Chief executive officer\u2019s budget proposal for Sola local authority, 1983."

      "It\u2019s almost like dealing with some City officials. They just let the public vent at their bimonthly council meetings. In my opinion, it\u2019s difficult to deal with narcissism and arrogance. Over the years, there has been some very good input to our elected officials on how to proceed on the Nacimiento water pipeline,but it fell on deaf ears. You wanted me to answer some of your questions,but you did not answer some of my questions. Again, are you willing to subsidize new development?,Yes?or No?, are you willing to pay for a commodity that you are not receiving? Yes?or No? and another question for you. Are you willing to pay over 300% on your water bills within the five (5) year plan that the City has proposed? Also, the water rates will be subject to later increases too. By the way, I do concur with the city\u2019s plan of \u201cyou pay for the amount of water units you use\u201d. (748 gal=one unit). However, the higher water rates are not good for our senior citizens on fixed incomes and other struggling families in our community. My first suggestion years ago was desalination. The response was it was too expensive. Of course, now it is more expensive. I would suggest that our elected officials recall the existing bonds (The bonds can be recalled early). The City council can explain to the citizens in detail with financing of new bonds at a lower interest rate as of now for the sewer plant and Nacimiento water pipeline and present their new proposal in compliance with Proposition 218. Let the citizens of Paso VOTE on the financing bonds for their approval. Most of the citizens,that I had spoken to were not happy with the way our City Council handled the Nacimiento water pipeline project. The citizens of Paso didn\u2019t give our City Council a \u201cBLANK CHECK\u201d for $176 million to spend without voter approval. I would suggest that it be a \u201cspecial tax\u201d or \u201can assessment\u201d be levied on our property taxes. A percentage of those bonds can be deducted on Federal Income taxes. As it is now, a\u201d fee\u201d on a capital funding project is not deductible.",

They wineries are allowed to take the water they are taking even if it drops the City\u2019s water levels in their wells. You need to complain to Sacramento. It sounds like you just don\u2019t want to pay anything for the infrastructure because you really just don\u2019t want it built. Several of your observations of my opinions are bizarre considering I have stated several times I believe the Courts need to decide if Paso Robles has, or has not followed the rules as to funding the infrastucture. Obviously, as I have stated before, if the City loses the lawsuit the infrastructure will have to be paid out of the City\u2019s General Fund until a new method of payment is voted on by the Citizens of Paso Robles."

      "The natural inclination would be for BC to replace Spaz with an offensive guy. Unfortunately there is not a great pool of candidates among current college offensive coordinators. There are plenty of good coordinators, but I don't know how many are ready to be head coaches or coach at a place like BC. These are some of the more prominent names. After the 2012 season, we'll have a better idea of if they are ready to take on an FBS head coaching job. Chad Morris\nOffensive Coordinator, Clemson\nChad Morris was coaching high school football three years ago. His meteoric rise to Clemson's playcaller is another example of how much college football has changed. Gus Malzahn and guys like Chip Kelly and Art Briles before him shot from relative obscurity to changing college football within a few season. Pedigree and climbing the ladders doesn't mean as much anymore. All that matters is how you score and Morris showed that he could give new life to Clemson's attack. Like the others mentioned Morris emphasized tempo and a no huddle. His track record is impressive, as is his reputation for teaching and implementing this offense. What to Watch for in 2012: Can Clemson keep it up? The ACC now has a chance to adjust to his scheme. It will also be interested to know what Morris wants to do. All these guys want to be head coaches, but is he willing to roll the dice on a job like BC? Would he even fit in? BC's very different from coaching high school in west Texas. Offensive Coordinator, Wisconsin\nThe Badgers have been a good proving ground for coordinators. I like the fit for BC since Wisconsin tends to develop and recruit like we do. They also have run \"pro style\" offenses with an emphasis on OL and the running attacks. Canada will be new there this fall, but he's got BCS experience and led explosive offenses in the MAC too. If Canada became a candidate for BC, I would have hesitation about his time at Indiana. They threw it a ton while he was calling plays but didn't win much. What to Watch in 2012: Will Canada keep throwing it at the more conservative Wisconsin?",
      "Diaz is young, but serving as a coordinator at Texas is a good proving ground. Mack Brown is in CEO mode, so his coordinators do much of the heavy lifting. It's great preparation for making the jump to head coach. What to Watch for in 2012: TOB's potential retirement. Diaz is one of the names on many NC State wish lists. If TOB steps down, some in their fan base will make a big push for Diaz to return to Raleigh. Defensive Coordinator, Notre Dame\nDiaco is one of the most relentless recruiters in college football. If he took over at BC, I think we could upgrade our talent quickly. The New Jersey native has plenty of ACC experience and has recruited at schools with academic restrictions. I don't love his scheme (3-4) and have a few concerns about his defenses being good but never dominant. But he would be a very good fit at BC and worth the risk. What to Watch for in 2012: An Irish implosion. Although his seat is not as hot as Spaz's, Kelly needs to win this year. If he's fired, we can't hire his fired defensive coordinator. The perception would be terrible among fans and recruits. Labels: Bob Diaco, Coach Flip is running the show, Coaches to Watch, fire Spaz, Manny Diaz, Mark Stoops, Pat Narduzzi, Speculating with Spaz\nMore people to follow\nA little over a month ago, I posted a few BC related names that you should follow. Now, I have a few more...\nBC Hockey Blog: twitter and blog. The diehard hockey fans already follow, but for those more casual BC hockey fans, this is a good place to keep up with our best team. Warren K. Zola: twitter. BC's Assistant Dean of Graduate programs is pretty plugged into the student athlete scene at BC. He contributes to the Huffington Post on Sports Law, sports news and College Sports. Lou Imbriano: twitter. The former Patriots executive and current BC professor tweets about a variety of sports and sports marketing news. In my opinion, BC should be leaning on him more with regards to how we market our programs. BC Che Chi's: twitter. A parody account that only a BC alum would understand."

    ],

    "documentation": [
      "The NGLs go to the fractionation facility, with a daily capacity of 64 000 barrels, for separation into methane, ethane, propane, and normal and iso butane. While the methane (natural gas) is used to fuel the plant, the other products (now known as liquefied petroleum gases \u2013 LPG) are made liquid by cooling and stored for export by sea. One reason for the choice of Teesside as the landfall for the Ekofisk pipeline was the opportunity it offered to install deepwater quays. The terminal has four of these, with those for crude oil able to handle tankers up to 150 000 deadweight tonnes. The LPG quays can accept carriers loading as much as 60 000 cubic metres. Two of the crude oil quays lie on the main channel of the River Tees, while the others have been installed in dredged docks. Gas terminal in Emden\nGas arriving at the Emden terminal from the Ekofisk Complex enters nine parallel treatment trains for cleaning, metering and onward distribution to the buyers. The North Sea gas is very clean, and needs only limited treatment to remove small amounts of sulphur compounds using an absorption process. Impure molecules from the gas accumulate on the surface of small particles, which act as filter spheres. Each of the nine trains comprises four process columns and a process oven. The gas enters the top of a column and leaves through the base after passing through the filter spheres. That leaves the gas ready for sale, and it is piped to the fiscal metering station before entering the buyer receiving pipelines and distribution network. Three separate commercial pipeline systems connect to the terminal, operated by Ruhrgas, BEB and Gastransport Services (previously Gasunie) respectively. They pipe the gas away on behalf of the gas buyers. The Norsea Gas Terminal in Emden was officially opened in September 1977 by Norwegian industry minister Bjartmar Gjerde and Phillips executive Gordon Goerin. Ranking as the first gas sales deal for the Norwegian continental shelf, the Ekofisk agreement paved the way for later contracts covering other fields off Norway.",
      "Source: ConocoPhillips Norge\n\u2014 Gas pipes at Ekofisk. Photo: Husmo Foto/Norwegian Petroleum Museum\nIn addition to ConocoPhillips\u2019 own production from Ekofisk, these pipelines carry gas and oil from the company\u2019s fields in the UK sector and from other fields on the Norwegian and British continental shelves. The three fields in the Greater Ekofisk Area are also tied together by pipelines. Oil pipeline to Teesside\nr\u00f8rledningene, engelsk,\nPipes and oil tanks at the Teesside plant. Photo: ConocoPhillips/Norwegian Petroleum Museum\nThe pipeline linking Ekofisk with the terminal for oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) at Teesside on the north-east English coast became operational in October 1975. Pumps raise the pressure of the oil and NGL before they start their journey to land. Two pumping stations \u2013 37/4 A and 36/22 A \u00ad\u2013 originally stood along the pipeline to maintain this pressure, but have now been disconnected and removed. The pipeline was installed with the ability to carry a million barrels per day. However, that much capacity has never been required. In the UK sector, a 24-inch pipeline has been tied in with a Y connection to receive input from several British fields \u2013 including the J block developments operated by ConocoPhillips. Output from the Greater Ekofisk Area is supplemented by crude from Valhall, Hod, Ula and Gyda heading for Teesside, optimising pipeline utilisation and thereby boosting value creation. The pipeline is owned by Norpipe Oil AS and operated by ConocoPhillips. Gas pipeline to Emden\nSandbags and gravel were used to cover Norpipe to Emden. Photo: Unknown/Norwegian Petroleum Museum\nThis pipeline became operational in September 1977. The starting pressure of around 132 bar is provided by compressors on the Ekofisk Complex. The 443-kilometre distance to Emden was split into three equal sections, with platforms B11 and H7 located at the intermediate points to provide boosting if required. However, additional compression was seldom needed on the final stage to Emden. H7 was shut down in 2007 and B11 in 2013, and both have since been removed."

      "For those with the hemoglobin H/Constant Spring form of the disease, the need for transfusions may be intermittent or ongoing, perhaps on a monthly basis and requiring desferoxamine treatment. Individuals with this more severe form of the disease may also have an increased chance of requiring removal of an enlarged and/or overactive spleen. Anemia \u2014 A blood condition in which the level of hemoglobin or the number of red blood cells falls below normal values. Common symptoms include paleness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Bilirubin \u2014 A yellow pigment that is the end result of hemoglobin breakdown. This pigment is metabolized in the liver and excreted from the body through the bile. Bloodstream levels are normally low; however, extensive red cell destruction leads to excessive bilirubin formation and jaundice. Bone marrow \u2014 A spongy tissue located in the hollow centers of certain bones, such as the skull and hip bones. Bone marrow is the site of blood cell generation. Bone marrow transplantation \u2014 A medical procedure used to treat some diseases that arise from defective blood cell formation in the bone marrow. Healthy bone marrow is extracted from a donor to replace the marrow in an ailing individual. Proteins on the surface of bone marrow cells must be identical or very closely matched between a donor and the recipient. Desferoxamine \u2014 The primary drug used in iron chelation therapy. It aids in counteracting the life-threatening buildup of iron in the body associated with long-term blood transfusions. Globin \u2014 One of the component protein molecules found in hemoglobin. Normal adult hemoglobin has a pair each of alpha-globin and beta-globin molecules. Heme \u2014 The iron-containing molecule in hemoglobin that serves as the site for oxygen binding. Hemoglobin \u2014 Protein-iron compound in the blood that carries oxygen to the cells and carries carbon dioxide away from the cells. Hemoglobin A \u2014 Normal adult hemoglobin that contains a heme molecule, two alpha-globin molecules, and two beta-globin molecules.",
      "In addition, hemoglobin H tends to precipitate out in the cells, causing damage to the red blood cell membrane. When affected individuals are exposed to certain drugs and chemicals known to make the membrane more fragile, the cells are thought to become vulnerable to breakdown in large numbers, a complication called hemolytic anemia. Fever and infection are also considered to be triggers of hemolytic anemia in hemoglobin H disease. This can result in fatigue, paleness, and a yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of eyes called jaundice. Usually, the anemia is mild enough not to require treatment. Severe anemia events may require blood transfusion, however, and are usually accompanied by such other symptoms as dark feces or urine and abdominal or back pain. These events are uncommon in hemoglobin H disease, although they occur more frequently in a more serious type of hemoglobin H disease called hemoglobin H/Constant Spring disease. Individuals effected with this type of hemoglobin H disease are also more likely to have enlargement of and other problems with the spleen. Alpha thalassemia major\nBecause alpha globin is a necessary component of all major hemoglobins and some minor hemoglobins, absence of all functioning alpha globin genes leads to serious medical consequences that begin even before birth. Affected fetuses develop severe anemia as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. The placenta, heart, liver, spleen, and adrenal glands may all become enlarged. Fluid can begin collecting throughout the body as early as the start of the second trimester, causing damage to developing tissues and organs. Growth retardation is also common. Affected fetuses usually miscarry or die shortly after birth. In addition, women carrying affected fetuses are at increased risk of developing complications of pregnancy and delivery. Up to 80% of such women develop toxemia, a disturbance of metabolism that can potentially lead to convulsions and coma. Other maternal complications include premature delivery and increased rates of delivery by cesarean section, as well as hemorrhage after delivery."

      "In this work, we provide a similar connection between state-space models and least-mean-squares (LMS). Our approach is based on approximating the posterior distribution with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. We show how the computation of this approximated posterior leads to a linear-complexity algorithm, comparable to the standard LMS. Similar approaches have already been developed for a variety of problems such as channel equalization using recurrent RBF neural networks \\cite{cid1994recurrent}, or Bayesian forecasting \\cite{harrison1999bayesian}. Here, we show the usefulness of this probabilistic approach for adaptive filtering. The probabilistic perspective we adopt throughout this work presents two main advantages. Firstly, a novel LMS algorithm with adaptable step size emerges naturally with this approach, making it suitable for both stationary and non-stationary environments. The proposed algorithm has less free parameters than previous LMS algorithms with variable step size \\cite{kwong1992variable,aboulnasr1997robust,shin2004variable}, and its parameters are easier to be tuned w.r.t. these algorithms and standard LMS. Secondly, the use of a probabilistic model provides us with an estimate of the error variance, which is useful in many applications. Experiments with simulated and real data show the advantages of the presented approach with respect to previous works. However, we remark that the main contribution of this paper is that it opens the door to introduce more Bayesian machine learning techniques, such as variational inference and Monte Carlo sampling methods \\cite{barber2012bayesian}, to adaptive filtering.\\\\\n\n\n\\section{Probabilistic Model}\n\nThroughout this work, we assume the observation model to be linear-Gaussian with the following distribution,\n\n\\begin{equation}\np(y_k|{\\bf w}_k) = \\mathcal{N}(y_k;{\\bf x}_k^T {\\bf w}_k , \\sigma_n^2),\n\\label{eq:mess_eq}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere  $\\sigma_n^2$ is the variance of the observation noise, ${\\bf x}_k$ is the regression vector and ${\\bf w}_k$ is the parameter vector to be sequentially estimated, both $M$-dimensional column vectors."

We conduct thorough ablations on this setup and provide valuable insights. We foresee multiple future directions for this work. The first is to expand this work to many languages and dialects. Secondly, it is a worthwhile research direction to distill this multi-model setup into a single model with multiple prediction heads. The obvious limitation of this system is the excessive memory consumption due to the usage of language specific models. For low resource languages this system is difficult to train and scale. We hope that these problems will be addressed by researchers in future works.",

We used an end-to-end deep learning pipeline which consisted of a language identification model and three language-specific models, one for each language. We converged upon the best combination by doing an elaborate analysis of various models available. Furthermore, in this work we also analyze the performance of the pipeline as a whole and also provide an ablation study. Lastly, we provide some future directions in this area of research.

      "Having seen a dozen or so HS-748s parked at Vadodara airport all through my childhood, I never once saw one in the air. They just seemed to be stored out in the open. Upon asking an IAF transport pilot who was my friend's father, he remarked \"zyaada kaam ke nahi hain yeh\". Why would you expend more capital on what is essentially an obsolete airframe, even if theoretically it had not yet reached its service life? You'd have to re-engine it, put new avionics on board and even that wouldn't suffice for para dropping requirements.. it was operationally never suitable for para dropping, which is an important mission for transport aircraft and had deficiencies in hot and high climes as well. Unfortunately, the 748 was never meant to be a military transport. At the request of IAF, its door was enlarged to enable larger cargo items to be loaded and to allow para dropping without hitting the tail plane. However, to load a jeep in it, a 30-ft long ramp was required. The jeep would drive in and insert its front wheels into the aircraft. Then it had to be manually lifted and turned to get it in. Unloading it was just as difficult. Para dropping of troops or cargo even from the aircraft with the enlarged door was considered too dangerous with the risk of hitting the tail plane. The aircraft's performance at hot and high airfields was hopelessly inadequate. Eventually IAF acquired the tail-loading An-32s which were powered specifically for IAF's need for operating in the Himalayas. BRF article -Avro in IAF service Now unless you want to overcome all these through a costly, time consuming engineering re-design program, that too without access to original documents since this airplane was designed in the 1960s, there is no question of keeping them going for another 40 years. By which time the original design would be over 80 years old and with no one on earth but the IAF as an operator and HAL as the agency supporting it. Hardly a situation anyone would want. abhik wrote: +1, Air India recently sold their entire fleet of Boeing 777s.",
      "Only 5 of the Boeing 777-200LR, to Etihad Airways, which IMO was a bad decision..they could have reconfigured the airplanes with just 2 classes and continued to fly them to the US, non-stop. The remaining 3 777-200LR were offered for lease but are still a part of AI's fleet since they didn't find any takers. This particular model hardly sold much and was developed for ultra-long range flights.. it was the least successful 777 model and clearly AI goofed up on the configuration by going for these in place of the 300ER. The economics however didn't make too much sense for AI eventually. there are 13 777-300ER as a part of their fleet ahd their economics is much better. Govt. to decide tomorrow on whether to go ahead and allow the IAF to verify the technical details of the C-295 bid by Tata-Airbus instead of scrapping the tender due to single vendor situation. The government will decide on Saturday whether to press ahead with the Rs 13,000 crore mega project for the private sector to supply 56 medium transport aircraft to the IAF despite only a single bidder, the Tata-Airbus consortium, being in the fray. Though the defence acquisitions council (DAC) chaired by Manohar Parrikar will take the final decision, MoD sources on Tuesday said the \"emerging dominant view\" is that green signal should be given to the crucial project designed to promote Indian private sector's entry into the domestic aerospace arena with foreign collaboration. \"The Tata-Airbus technical and commercial bid is a credible offer submitted in a competitive environment. The other seven contenders backed out for one reason or the other,\" said a source. IAF has now sought the clearance of the DAC -- the first such meeting to be chaired by Parrikar after becoming defence minister on November 10 -- to begin technical evaluation of the C-295 aircraft offered by Airbus Defence & Space and Tata Advanced Systems. Though it has become a single-vendor situation, the DAC can approve it if it wants as per existing procurement procedures."

Each score is the average of three models with different seeds. The BS and BR indicate BERTScore and BLEURT, respectively. Statistics on the number of cases handled by physicians. C/P denotes Cases/Physician, which indicates how many cases an individual physician has. Method of Grouping Physician IDs A most naive method of mapping physician IDs to features is without any grouping process. The data contains 4,846 physicians, so |M | was set to 4,846.However it caused our model's training to be unstable. This might be due to the many physician IDs appearing for the first time in the test time. Table\n\nabstract\n\nDuring the patient's hospitalization, the physician must record daily observations of the patient and summarize them into a brief document called \"discharge summary\" when the patient is discharged. Automated generation of discharge summary can greatly relieve the physicians' burden, and has been addressed recently in the research community. Most previous studies of discharge summary generation using the sequenceto-sequence architecture focus on only inpatient notes for input. However, electric health records (EHR) also have rich structured metadata (e.g., hospital, physician, disease, length of stay, etc.) that might be useful.",
      "In this paper, we first reveal the effects of meta-information on neural abstractive summarization on admissions. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder transformer with an additional feature embedding layer in the encoder (Figure ). Hospital, physician, disease, and length of stay are used as meta-information, and each feature is embedded in the vector space. For experiments, we collect progress notes, discharge summaries and coded information from the electronic health record system, which are managed by a largest multi-hospital organization in Japan. Our main contributions are as follows: \u2022 We found that a transformer encoding meta-information generates higher quality summaries than the vanilla one, and clarified the benefit of using meta-information for medical summarization tasks. \u2022 We found that a model encoding disease information can produce proper disease and symptom words following the source. In addition, we found that the model using physician and hospital information can generate symbols that are commonly written in the summary. \u2022 We are the first to apply the abstractive summarization method to generate Japanese discharge summaries. In the studies of summarization of medical documents, it is common to retrieve key information such as disease, examination result, or medication from EHRs - . Other researchs more similar to our study targeted to help physicians get the point of medical documents quickly by generating a few key sentences - . Studies generating contextualized summaries can be categorized by the type of model inputs and architectures. Some studies produced a whole discharge summary using structured data for input - The sensitivity of the gram stain for bacterial meningitis is about 60%, and the sensitivity of the culture is not high either. Also, the glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid would have been slightly lower. Although no definitive diagnosis could be made, bacterial meningitis was the most suspicious disease. The causative organism was assumed to be MRSA, and vancomycin and meropenem (meningitis dose) were used to cover a wide range of enteric bacteria."

    "documentation": [
      "Under the germ theory there are no negative feedbacks. This makes a stable biological system by definition impossible. The immune system is *not* a negative feedback it is the opposite. It actually reinforces our math problem because the immune system will weaken as the number of pathogens increase. There is no way of resolving this problem without a discontinuity. A Deus ex Machina as The Almighty Pill so beautifully put it. So the germ theory is quite literally, mathematically impossible. There is as much chance of it being true as 2+2 = 5. There are plenty of other massive problems with germ theory such as why did things like SARS and bird flu magically disappear? Why do we have the symptoms that we do? Is our body controlling the symptoms to help fight the germs and if so, why would suppressing the symptoms with antibiotics or Tamiflu be considered a good idea? If the virus is causing the symptoms then why would it cause these kinds of things?",
      "And even if we could, we would already be immune rendering every vaccine pointless. Once we had survived our first few days on earth, then we could never get sick again. If that's wrong then we must conclude that precisely 0% of germs are pathogenic. Plus your comment about the immune system completely misunderstood my point. The immune system does not allow us to overcome our math problem. In fact, it makes it worse. You did provide one solitary example of a patient with what are presumably yellow fever symptoms but you didn't say whether they had been given any toxic medical treatments. And like I said before, the whole \"incubation period\" is more than a little suspicious. Clearly they never found what they thought they would and just rigged the results to tell them what they want to hear. Like every other germ theorist/vaccine promoter in history. Many kinds of bacteria are constantly evolving and changing, like flu viruses. Others are more stable over time, like the yellow fever virus. Those that change develop new ways of infiltrating the cells of the organism being attacked (from our point of view, from its unconscious point of view, it's just carrying out its need to replicate, which it can only do inside the cells of its host). The changes which allow it to better infiltrate are more successful and result in more viruses with those traits. Our immune system is designed to detect and destroy potentially dangerous invading pathogens. Many bacteria are usually harmless and absolutely necessary. The minority are dangerous, and most people's immune systems do a good job of analyzing them and killing them, often with no signs of disease. Others experience a clinical infection, and the immune system usually mounts a successful attack on them. The outcome of disease always depends both on the virulence of the pathogen and the health of the individual immune system. Vaccines are usually effective in giving immunity to the targeted diseases. They also have many dangers which everyone should be aware of, and vaccines should be avoided whenever possible."

    "question": "Given the observed transcriptional reactivation of both exogenous transgenes and endogenous retroviruses under essential amino acid (AA) deprivation, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the proposed mechanism underlying this phenomenon?",
    "choices": [
      "A) The GCN2 kinase pathway is directly activated by AA starvation, leading to histone acetylation and transgene reactivation.",
      "B) Ribosomal stress induced by AA deprivation triggers a MEK/ERK and/or JNK-dependent signaling cascade, ultimately affecting epigenetic modifications and gene expression.",
      "C) Sirtuins and DNA methylation play a crucial role in mediating the transcriptional response to AA restriction, as evidenced by the observed reactivation of silenced transgenes.",
      "D) The transgene reactivation response is solely dependent on the specific AA deprivation, with methionine/cysteine starvation being the primary trigger for this phenomenon."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "Furthermore, this transgene reactivation response was not reproduced by serum starvation, activation of p38, or pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR (PP242 or rapamycin), sirtuins and DNA methylation. By contrast, it was induced by pan histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and by selective inhibitors of class II HDACs . Consistently, we found that the mechanism responsible involves epigenetic modifications at the transgene promoter, including reduced nucleosome occupancy and increased histone acetylation, and is mediated in part by reduced expression of a class II HDAC, namely HDAC4 . These findings indicate that AA deprivation induces a specific epigenetic and transcriptional response, affecting the expression of newly-integrated exogenous transgenes and proviruses, and suggesting that endogenous sequences sharing similar structural and functional features may represent a transcriptional target as well [30, 31]. In particular, transposable elements, such as LTR-retrotransposons (or endogenous retroviruses, ERVs), are genomic \u201cparasites\u201d anciently-integrated into the genome, and silenced by epigenetic mechanisms of mammalian cells against the spreading of mobile elements, eventually becoming \"endogenized\" during evolution [32, 33]. This raises the question of whether their expression is also sensitive to AA restriction. In addition, it remains unclear whether or not the transgene reactivation response is related to specific AA deprivations, and most importantly which is the AA sensing/signaling pathway involved, in particular whether the GCN2 kinase is implicated. Thus, here we used the reactivation of silenced transgenes in cultured cells, as a model to investigate a novel molecular pathway induced by imbalanced EAA starvation, implicated in the epigenetic/transcriptional regulation of exogenous non-native DNA sequences and possibly of other endogenous anciently-integrated genomic elements. HeLa human epithelial carcinoma, HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma and C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells were maintained in DMEM containing glutaMAX (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma), 100 U/ml penicillin G (Invitrogen), 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.",
      "Current address: Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom. In a variety of species, reduced food intake, and in particular protein or amino acid (AA) restriction, extends lifespan and healthspan. However, the underlying epigenetic and/or transcriptional mechanisms are largely unknown, and dissection of specific pathways in cultured cells may contribute to filling this gap. We have previously shown that, in mammalian cells, deprivation of essential AAs (methionine/cysteine or tyrosine) leads to the transcriptional reactivation of integrated silenced transgenes, including plasmid and retroviral vectors and latent HIV-1 provirus, by a process involving epigenetic chromatic remodeling and histone acetylation. Here we show that the deprivation of methionine/cysteine also leads to the transcriptional upregulation of endogenous retroviruses, suggesting that essential AA starvation affects the expression not only of exogenous non-native DNA sequences, but also of endogenous anciently-integrated and silenced parasitic elements of the genome. Moreover, we show that the transgene reactivation response is highly conserved in different mammalian cell types, and it is reproducible with deprivation of most essential AAs. The General Control Non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase and the downstream integrated stress response represent the best candidates mediating this process; however, by pharmacological approaches, RNA interference and genomic editing, we demonstrate that they are not implicated. Instead, the response requires MEK/ERK and/or JNK activity and is reproduced by ribosomal inhibitors, suggesting that it is triggered by a novel nutrient-sensing and signaling pathway, initiated by translational block at the ribosome, and independent of mTOR and GCN2. Overall, these findings point to a general transcriptional response to essential AA deprivation, which affects the expression of non-native genomic sequences, with relevant implications for the epigenetic/transcriptional effects of AA restriction in health and disease."

Thompson is a welcome addition, as the Herald's focus has been spotty since Steve Conroy started splitting his time on hockey. Hopefully a new voice on the BC scene will also spark Blauds to improve his work. For many years, BC fans' main source of news was Mike (Vega at the Globe) and Mike (Shalin at the Herald). We complained about their identical features and soft touch on the BC coaches. Little did we know how good things were. Since Vega's move in 2007, we've been left with a beat writer who seems to loathe his job and also makes excuses for our Head Coach. Blauds also rarely writes or tweets during the college offseason. That sort of editorial decision may have been fine 20 years ago, but now college sports is a year round news cycle. When you look at all the work produced by college beat writers around the country, it makes the Boston media look lazy or oblivious. Thompson also plans to tweet regularly once the season starts. I hope he makes the most of this opportunity. It is a shame to see the beat neglected like it is across town. Labels: blauds, Boston Herald, Boston media, Media Criticism, Rich Thompson\nRevisiting a Boston (BC) Olympics using London as an example\nDuring the 2010 Winter Olympics I tossed around the idea of Boston hosting a summer or winter games. My point then remains that the same: Boston is ideal because the local universities could already supply many of the venues. The big obstacle would always be the main stadium for Track & Field and the opening and closing ceremonies. Nearly every city that hosts is left with a White Elephant that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. But London may provide a solution. They built their Olympic Stadium as a temporary venue. It looked great on TV, holds enough for the games and can be shrunk as soon as it all wraps up. Londoners haven't decided what they will do with the space. There are a few different bidders looking to take over the remains of the stadium.",

Perhaps, BC can learn from them. Fewer Seats\nThe NFL is lowering the bar, so that blackout rules don't require sellouts. Blackouts are not an issue in college, but perhaps few seats will help demand and make Alumni seem full. I don't want to tear out seats, but maybe we can replace the bleachers with actual seats.

Yes, the MTA project should fold the Avro, An-32 and the regional transport role and become a conversion project rather a development one. The driving numbers will come from the regional transport (thousands in India itself) rather than the Avro or medium transport roles (max 300 between them). This changes the ball game and introduces all kinds of possibilities. But I'm pretty sure that the Il-214/MTA is not the way to go because it will take a decade or more to arrive. A good possibility was another Antonov, the An-148 but it has some mechanical glitches apparently besides being bogged down in the Ukraine mess. Maybe the Russians can \"relocate\" the aircraft to Russia? The other possibility is the BAe-146 which is ironically another Avro. We should remember that both the HS-748 \"Avro\" and An-32 were regional airliners that were converted to military use, not the other way around. HAL or a private firm will pick up a lot of experience in the conversion process itself. The Sukhoi Superjet is already in production/orders,with over 100+ for Russian and intl. customers. It is ideal for regional transport,perfect for flights to smaller Tier-2/3 cities from metros. If we really want a regional jet this is the fastest way toi go,we can set up a manufacturing unti here for the same at an HAL unit.

This particular model hardly sold much and was developed for ultra-long range flights.. it was the least successful 777 model and clearly AI goofed up on the configuration by going for these in place of the 300ER.

The government will decide on Saturday whether to press ahead with the Rs 13,000 crore mega project for the private sector to supply 56 medium transport aircraft to the IAF despite only a single bidder, the Tata-Airbus consortium, being in the fray. Though the defence acquisitions council (DAC) chaired by Manohar Parrikar will take the final decision, MoD sources on Tuesday said the \"emerging dominant view\" is that green signal should be given to the crucial project designed to promote Indian private sector's entry into the domestic aerospace arena with foreign collaboration. \"The Tata-Airbus technical and commercial bid is a credible offer submitted in a competitive environment. The other seven contenders backed out for one reason or the other,\" said a source. IAF has now sought the clearance of the DAC -- the first such meeting to be chaired by Parrikar after becoming defence minister on November 10 -- to begin technical evaluation of the C-295 aircraft offered by Airbus Defence & Space and Tata Advanced Systems. Though it has become a single-vendor situation, the DAC can approve it if it wants as per existing procurement procedures."

      "At the time of his re-election, English announced his intention to stay on as leader until the next general election. On 13 February 2018, however, he stood down as National Party leader due to personal reasons, and instructed the party to put into motion the processes to elect a new leader. He also retired from Parliament. English's resignation followed weeks of speculation that he would step aside for a new leader. On 27 February, he was succeeded as party leader by Simon Bridges as the result of the leadership election held that day. Post-premiership \nIn 2018, English joined the board of Australian conglomerate, Wesfarmers. English serves in Chairmanships of Mount Cook Alpine Salmon, Impact Lab Ltd and Manawanui Support Ltd. He is also a director of The Instillery, Centre for Independent Studies and The Todd Corporation Limited, and is a member of the Impact Advisory Group of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets. Political and social views\n\nEnglish is regarded as more socially conservative than his predecessor, John Key. He has stated his opposition to voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, same-sex civil unions, and the decriminalisation of prostitution. As Prime Minister he opposed any \"liberalisation\" of abortion law. In 2004, English voted against a bill to establish civil unions for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. In 2005, he voted for the Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill, which would have amended the Marriage Act to define marriage as only between a man and a woman. English voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill that legalised same-sex marriage in New Zealand. However, in December 2016 he stated, \"I'd probably vote differently now on the gay marriage issue. I don't think that gay marriage is a threat to anyone else's marriage\". In 2009, English voted against the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill, a bill aimed at amending the Misuse of Drugs Act so that cannabis could be used for medical purposes.",
      "English had been a supporter of Bolger as leader, but Shipley reappointed him Minister of Health in her new cabinet. English was promoted to Minister of Finance in a reshuffle in January 1999, a position which was at the time subordinate to the Treasurer, Bill Birch. After a few months, the pair switched positions as part of Birch's transition to retirement, with English assuming the senior portfolio. In early interviews, he emphasised his wish to be seen as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue, and said that the initiatives of some of his predecessors (Roger Douglas's \"Rogernomics\" and Ruth Richardson's \"Ruthanasia\") had focused on \"fruitless, theoretical debates\" when \"people just want to see problems solved\". Opposition (1999\u20132008)\n\nAfter the National Party lost the 1999 election to Helen Clark's Labour Party, English continued on in the shadow cabinet as National's spokesperson for finance. He was elected deputy leader of the party in February 2001, following the resignation of Wyatt Creech, with Gerry Brownlee being his unsuccessful opponent. Leader of the Opposition\nIn October 2001, after months of speculation, Jenny Shipley resigned as leader of the National Party after being told she no longer had the support of the party caucus. English was elected as her replacement unopposed (with Roger Sowry as his deputy), and consequently became Leader of the Opposition. However, he did not openly organise against Shipley, and according to The Southland Times \"there was almost an element of 'aw, shucks, I'll do it then' about Mr English's ascension\". Aged 39 when he was elected, English became the second-youngest leader in the National Party's history, after Jim McLay (who was 38 when elected in 1984). He also became only the third Southlander to lead a major New Zealand political party, after Joseph Ward and Adam Hamilton. However, English failed to improve the party's performance. In the 2002 election, National suffered its worst electoral defeat ever, gaining barely more than twenty percent of the vote."

Ultimately, the best bet is going to come form the 787's that take a fewer people (so you can do the longer routes) with still a competitive CASM, and the B and F class folks will pay good money for newer aircraft. Postby Kartik \u00bb 04 Dec 2014 12:55\nLets see if there is any forward movement on the stalled MTA project once Putin arrives in New Delhi\nMajor defence deals to be signed during Putin-Modi summit\nIn this connection, it is expected that during the summit, Russia and India may ultimately resolve several long-delayed agreements on military-technical cooperation projects between the two countries and sign them finally for their implementation. These agreements, above all, include joint Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) project and joint development of Multi-role Transport Aircraft (MTA). A final deal on FGFA for production has been delayed because the Indian Air Force (IAF) did not approve the design and work-share. Now Russia has reportedly agreed that the jet would be a two-seat design, not a one-seater. India\u2019s work-share would also be increased from18 percent to 25 percent, and even up to 40-50 percent in the near future, in view of the steady development of the Indian aviation industry. Defence and SecurityAccording to the agreement, India\u2019s stealth air-to-air missile \u201cAstra\u201d along with Indo-Russian BrahMos supersonic cruise missile will be mounted on the FGFA. The preliminary design agreement on FGFA had been signed in 2010 between Indian HAL and Russian Sukhoi Design Bureau to build the jet for the use by both countries. The final design contract was to be signed in July-August 2012. But the deadline has already passed. According to the Indian media reports, under the programme, India is expected to build 200 fighter jets at the cost of $30 billion. FGFA is not the only Indo-Russia joint project. The two countries also signed an agreement on the joint development of MTA in 2007, based on Il-214 Russian plane.",
      "The cost of the $600 million project is being equally shared by the two countries. The MTA, when developed, will have ready market for 205 aircraft - 45 for the Indian Air Force, 100 for the Russian Air Force, and 60 more for exporting to friendly countries. The international market for MTA is estimated at 390 planes. Under the agreement, thirty percent of the annual production of planes could be exported to third countries. The MTA was expected to go in service with the Russian and Indian Air Forces in 2015. But the project faced a number of problems, delaying the development of the MTA. The project got into rough weather after India felt there was nothing much for Indian engineers and scientists to do in the design and development of the MTA. However, all the issues related to the project were resolved with the Russians when the HAL undertook to carry out design and development of its work-share of MTA at Aircraft R&D Centre at Bangalore. Russian Ilyushin Design Bureau and the Irkut Corporation and HAL are participating in the project. The first flight is expected to take place in 2017-18. The MTA would replace the AN- 32 aircraft being used by the IAF. It will be used for both cargo and troop transportation, para-drop and air drop of supplies, including low-altitude parachute extraction system. BrahMos missile exports a challenging proposition\nAnother key deal expected to be signed during the summit, is for the development of \u201cBrahMos mini missile\u201d by the Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace which manufactures supersonic cruise missile. BrahMos\u2019 new CEO Sudhir Mishra recently said he was hopeful that a deal to develop the mini version of the missile will be signed during Putin\u2019s summit with Modi. \u201cWe are hoping to sign a tripartite agreement between DRDO, NPOM lab and BrahMos Aerospace during the planned visit of Russian President in December,\u201d Mishra said. He said that the new missile will have a speed of 3.5 mach and carry a payload of 300 km up to a range of 290 km. In size, it will be about half of the present missile, which is around 10 metres long."

      "I decided that even if there were serious problems in the wing that was built, I would be money ahead to go ahead and buy the project. For the advertised price, I could build a new set of wings and still be way ahead financially. We negotiated a final price, shook hands, took my ride to the airport, and started off in search of a U-haul to haul the project home. Now, at this point, some of you are thinking about what I surely must have forgotten to inspect and why didn't I take a local A & P or EAA member along for the ride. First of all, I don't know any mechanics locally that have any experience with glass and our EAA chapter of which I am VP is woefully lacking in fiberglass knowledge. Secondly, as you will see, I missed plenty. Some by ignorance, some by just not looking close enough. Now for a list of the problems that I found over the last year and a few of the fixes that I came up with. I found that the lower set of rear spar attach fittings on the left rear spar were installed backwards with the longer spaced hole towards the fuselage. Since this is the same place that also had the cracked spar cap, it required a major change. Also in the same area he had drilled through the rear spar with a hole saw to create a place for the aileron cable to pass through and managed to cut out the second from the outside vertical brace in the spar. Then he chose to install the aileron bellcranks in front of the rear spar, and cut another hole through the rear spar for the aileron push rod. He also managed to cut out the outside vertical brace in the spar. Since the holes were already drilled through the spar, the choices were to either cut out that section of spar cap and scarf a new piece in, cut the whole rear spar carrythrough out of the fuselage including ruining the left lower wing skin, or do something else creative to reinforce the spar cap and install a custom built set of attach fittings. I also found that after I built and installed the right side wing stub ribs and skin that the aileron bellcrank setup would not work as installed.",
      "Retapping the fitting the right direction seemed to be a good fix for that problem. When I finally got around to attaching the wing to the fuselage, I found that the front spar attach fittings were badly misaligned. Although they could be forced into alignment, I didn't think I needed that kind of preload on the main spar fittings. This problem was fixed by calling on my local neighborhood machinist to build me an aligning fixture and reaming the attach holes to the next larger size and ordering the new sized bolts. On the fuselage I found that although it had new Cleveland wheels and brakes on it, one of the brakes had a severe wobble to it. I must complement the manufacturers for taking care of that problem. One call to the Cleveland factory and they shipped me a new set of wheels and brakes even though the receipt for this set was over four years old and in the original builders name. Their only concern was that this set had never been placed in service yet. I chose to sand the load of micro off the left wing to see what it was covering. When I got down to the glass, I found that there was no glass for the aft inch and a half of the underside of the wing in front of the aileron hinge. With the Diehl wing skins, you build the wings, then cut the ailerons out of trailing edge of the wing. He had mismeasured and cut too much material off the bottom side of the trailing edge in front of the aileron. It was filled by floxing a piece of spruce into the gap to fill the space between the back edge of the fiberglass and the aileron mount. I chose to wrap the trailing edge of that wing, and the other wing to match with a couple of lay-ups of glass. When I sanded the primer off the aforementioned damaged trim tab, I found that the hinge was floxed to the leading edge of the foam insides of the tab, but not the glass. I also chose to wrap the front of the trim tab with a lay-up of glass. I decided to pull the paper off the canopy and take a look at it before I'm ready to bolt it on and fly. The original builder had blown his own canopy and after some of the previous problems, I was beginning to have some concerns about not having looked it over closely enough."

      "However, elsewhere, journals with no research data policy, such as Antiquity, has one of the lower levels of data sharing (Figure 1). Chart showing the location of primary archaeobotanical data in Vegetation History and Archaeobotany. There are various reasons for why a primary dataset may be lacking. The option of providing supplementary datasets has been available in many of the journals here since before the start of the surveyed period (e.g. Vegetation History and Archaeobotany in 2004), and so cannot be a reason for the absence of data publication in this journal while it may be a reason in other journals. Reasons suggested for a lack of data sharing within archaeology include technological limitations, and resistance amongst some archaeologists to making their data available due to cautions of exposing data to scrutiny, lost opportunities of analysis before others use it and loss of \u2018capital\u2019 of data (Moore & Richards 2015: 34\u201335). Furthermore, control over how data tables is presented (taxa ordering, summary data presented) may also contribute to the preferential publishing of data within journal articles. Another factor to consider is the emphasis on the creation of new data through archaeological research (Huvila 2016). The creation of a new archaeobotanical dataset through primary analysis is a key form of training in archaeobotany, and the perception of the value of the reuse of other previously published archaeobotanical journals may be low, hence not encouraging the sharing of well-documented datasets. Excellent exams of data reuse have resulted in influential studies (Bogaard 2004; Riehl 2008; Wallace et al. 2019), and would hopefully encourage further data sharing in the future. Given that there are numerous examples of meta-analysis which do take place in archaeobotany, it seems likely that the prevalent form of data sharing is through informal data sharing between individual specialists. However, this does not improve access to data in the long term, and is inefficient and time consuming, with large potential for data errors (Kansa & Kansa 2013), and relies on personal networks, which are likely to exclude some researchers.",
      "Third, general archaeology journals (Antiquity, Journal of Field Archaeology, Oxford Journal of Archaeology, Journal of Anthropological Archaeology, Journal of World Prehistory). Finally, the broader cross-disciplinary journals PLoS One and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) were included. Published articles from the past ten years (2009\u20132018) have been analysed in order to assess the availability of plant macrofossil data. This ten-year period brackets the period where most archaeological journals have moved online and adopted supplementary materials. Data citation in synthetic studies has been assessed in the same range of publications. The extent of data reuse ranges from the analysis of whole sample data to the presence/absence of individual crops. The location of a data citation has been assessed in the same range of publications, with the addition of journals where occasional research incorporating archaeobotanical data is featured (Britannia, Journal of Archaeological Research, Ethnobiology Letters, Medieval Archaeology, Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society, World Archaeology). The underlying dataset for the analysis is available in Lodwick 2019. 4.1. Primary data sharing\nHere, the location of primary archaeobotanical data, that is sample level counts of macroscopic plant remains, was assessed for 239 journal articles across 16 journals (Lodwick 2019 Table 1). Figure 1 shows the results grouped by journal. Overall, only 56% of articles shared their primary data. In, Antiquity, JAS, JASR, PLOS One, Quaternary International and VHA, the highest proportion of publications did not include their primary data, that is to say that the sample-by-sample counts of plant macrofossils was not available. This level of data is comparable to the findings of other pilot studies in archaeology. Marwick and Pilaar Birch found a data sharing rate of 53% from 48 articles published in Journal of Archaeological Science in Feb \u2013 May 2017 (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018: 7), and confirm previous assertions that data is often withheld in archaeology (Kansa 2012: 499)."

      "The second assay used in studying the interaction of two cell types is the migration assay where cellular movement can be tracked on the surface of the other cell type monolayer 14,15. This assay is commonly known as inverted coverslip assay. Schwann cells are cultured on small glass fragments and they are inverted face down onto the surface of astrocyte monolayers and migration is assessed from the edge of coverslip. Both assays have been instrumental in studying the underlying mechanisms involved in the cellular exclusion and boundary formation.

Ippolito, Cagla Eroglu. Institutions: Duke University, Duke University. One of the most important goals in neuroscience is to understand the molecular cues that instruct early stages of synapse formation. As such it has become imperative to develop objective approaches to quantify changes in synaptic connectivity. Starting from sample fixation, this protocol details how to quantify synapse number both in dissociated neuronal culture and in brain sections using immunocytochemistry. Using compartment-specific antibodies, we label presynaptic terminals as well as sites of postsynaptic specialization. We define synapses as points of colocalization between the signals generated by these markers. The number of these colocalizations is quantified using a plug in Puncta Analyzer (written by Bary Wark, available upon request, c.eroglu@cellbio.duke.edu) under the ImageJ analysis software platform. The synapse assay described in this protocol can be applied to any neural tissue or culture preparation for which you have selective pre- and postsynaptic markers.",

Afshari, Jessica C. Kwok, James W. Fawcett. Institutions: University of Cambridge. Schwann cells are one of the commonly used cells in repair strategies following spinal cord injuries. Schwann cells are capable of supporting axonal regeneration and sprouting by secreting growth factors 1,2 and providing growth promoting adhesion molecules 3 and extracellular matrix molecules 4. In addition they myelinate the demyelinated axons at the site of injury 5. However following transplantation, Schwann cells do not migrate from the site of implant and do not intermingle with the host astrocytes 6,7. This results in formation of a sharp boundary between the Schwann cells and astrocytes, creating an obstacle for growing axons trying to exit the graft back into the host tissue proximally and distally. Astrocytes in contact with Schwann cells also undergo hypertrophy and up-regulate the inhibitory molecules 8-13. In vitro assays have been used to model Schwann cell-astrocyte interactions and have been important in understanding the mechanism underlying the cellular behaviour. These in vitro assays include boundary assay, where a co-culture is made using two different cells with each cell type occupying different territories with only a small gap separating the two cell fronts. As the cells divide and migrate, the two cellular fronts get closer to each other and finally collide. This allows the behaviour of the two cellular populations to be analyzed at the boundary. Another variation of the same technique is to mix the two cellular populations in culture and over time the two cell types segregate with Schwann cells clumped together as islands in between astrocytes together creating multiple Schwann-astrocyte boundaries."

      "New signs the military operation in the region is facing some tough new challenges. Our Pentagon correspondent, Barbara Starr is here. She's watching the story. She's got more. What are you learning? BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, there was very dramatic, very hard-nosed testimony today on Capitol Hill from the top U.S. commander responsible for the U.S. involvement in Libya, saying that Gadhafi forces are becoming increasingly difficult to target, as they are using civilian vehicles, mixing in with local populations, moving next to mosques, schools, hospitals -- all the same tactics we saw for years in Iraq. And now, all of this today leading to a very dramatic exchange between General Carter Ham and one of the most vocal administration critics, Senator John McCain. SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: Hearing your testimony, General Ham, is almost an Orwellian experience for me. The fact is that if we had imposed the no-fly zone three weeks, four weeks ago, Gadhafi would not be in power today. The fact is that the situation on the ground is basically a stalemate. Would you say that the situation on the ground is a stalemate or an emerging stalemate?\nGEN. CARTER HAM, COMMANDER, U.S. AFRICA COMMAND: Senator, I -- I would agree with that if present on the ground. MCCAIN: So the goal -- our policy objective of the removal of Gadhafi is further from being achieved than it was three or four weeks ago. HAM: Senator, I -- I don't know that I would agree with that. What I -- because that, again, was not a military mission. The military mission of protecting, I think, was not wholly achieved, but achieved in large part. STARR: General Ham also acknowledging another problem -- a key U.S. aircraft, the AC-130, that flies low and slow to target on the ground, is facing what he called \"a significant threat\" from surface to air missiles, which he said remain effective and operational in some cases. And, Wolf, get this. General Ham says there were about 20,000 of those surface to air missiles when the campaign started and they are concerned that an awful lot of them are still out there -- Wolf.\nBLITZER:",
      "Barbara, thanks very much for that report. Panicked rebels are once again on the retreat from Gadhafi's forces. Just today, at least three people were killed, another 10 injured, in new air strikes. And there are mounting questions about whether NATO could be responsible for the attack. Our senior international correspondent, Ben Wedeman, is joining us now from Benghazi. Ben's watching all of this closely. You just heard General Ham, who is the commander of the U.S. military's Africa Command. He was in charge of the mission before handing over complete control to NATO. You just heard him say there could be a stalemate out there. What's the sense on the ground? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the sense was a few days ago that it was, indeed, a stalemate -- sort of a seesaw battle that went back and forth between Ajdabiya and Brega. But what we saw today was that that seesaw was tipped over. And it was a general retreat by the opposition forces from somewhere near Brega to almost the other side of Ajdabiya. This, after this air strike, which almost everybody on the ground believes to be NATO leaving not three, but four people dead. And many others are still unaccounted for. That set off this general retreat whereby we saw all their heavy -- all of the opposition forces' heavy equipment -- multiple rocket launchers, tens and tens of these pickup trucks mounted with heavy machine guns streaming through Ajdabiya to the other side, the far side of the city. Some of them going all the way back to Benghazi, according to the head of the rebel forces in the eastern part of the country, Abdul Fatah Younis. He says that the Gadhafi forces were approaching Ajdabiya from three different directions. I would not call that a stalemate -- Wolf.\nBLITZER: Ben, you got a close-up look at some of the casualties today out on the front lines. WEDEMAN: It's very bad, very bad. I mean it wasn't just fighters. It was also medics who had gone to the scene of this reported air strike, which then got hit again."

      "Avalanche times predicted by coupled rate equation calculations range widely.

      "\\section{Introduction}\nIn recent years, vehicular technology has attracted significant attention from the automotive and telecommunication industries, leading to the emergence of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications for improving road safety, traffic management services and driving comfort. V2X supported by the sixth generation (6G) is envisioned to be a key enabler of future connected autonomous vehicles \\cite{9779322}. Although its transformative benefits for leveraging intelligent transportation systems, V2X still face several technical issues mainly related to performance and security. The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged very recently as a revolutionary element of 6G that could potentially help enabling adaptive learning and intelligent decision-making in future V2X applications. The combination of sensing and communication allows vehicles to perceive their surroundings better, predict manoeuvres from nearby users and make intelligent decisions, thus paving the way toward a safer transportation system \\cite{9665433}. Modernized vehicles are augmented with various types of sensors divided into exteroceptive to observe their surrounding environment and proprioceptive to observe their internal states. The former like GPS, Lidar, and Cameras are conveyed to improve situational awareness, while latter sensors, such as steering, pedal, and wheel speed, convey to improve self-awareness. While sensing the environment, vehicles can exchange messages that assist in improving situational- and self-awareness and in coordinating maneuvers with other vehicles. Those messages like the basic safety (BSMs) and cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) are composed of transmitting vehicle's states such as position and velocity and other vehicles' states in the vicinity. Vehicles might use their sensors, such as cameras and Lidar, to detect road users (e.g., pedestrians), which can be communicated with other road users via the V2X messages to improve the overall performance.",
      "However, V2X communication links carrying those messages are inherently vulnerable to malicious attacks due to the open and shared nature of the wireless spectrum among vehicles and other cellular users \\cite{8336901}. For instance, a jammer in the vicinity might alter the information to be communicated to nearby vehicles/users or can intentionally disrupt communication between a platoon of vehicles making the legitimate signals unrecognizable for on-board units (OBUs) and/or road side units (RSUs) that endanger vehicular safety \n\\cite{8553649}. In addition, the integrity of GPS signals and the correct acquisition of navigation data to compute position, velocity and time information is critical in V2X applications for their safe operation. However, since civil GPS receivers rely on unencrypted satellite signals, spoofers can easily replicate them by deceiving the GPS receiver to compute falsified positions \\cite{9226611}. Also, the long distance between satellites and terrestrial GPS receivers leads to an extremely weak signal that can be easily drowned out by a spoofer. Thus, GPS sensors' vulnerability to spoofing attacks poses a severe threat that might be causing vehicles to be out of control or even hijacked and endanger human life \\cite{9881548}. Therefore, GPS spoofing attacks and jamming interference needs to be controlled and detected in real-time to reach secured vehicular communications allowing vehicles to securely talk to each other and interact with the infrastructure (e.g., roadside terminals, base stations) \\cite{9860410}. Existing methods for GPS spoofing detection include GPS signal analysis methods and GPS message encryption methods \\cite{9845684}. However, the former requires the ground truth source during the detection process, which is not always possible to collect. In contrast, the latter involves support from a secured infrastructure and advanced computing resources on GPS receivers, which hinders their adoption in V2X applications. On the other hand, existing methods for jammer detection in vehicular networks are based on analysing the packet drop rate as in \\cite{9484071}, making it difficult to detect an advanced jammer manipulating the legitimate signal instead of disrupting it."

      "\\subsection{FPSA: Fokker-Planck Synthetic Acceleration}\\label{FPSA}\n\nIn the FPSA scheme \\cite{JapanFPSA,japanDiss}, the FP approximation is used as a preconditioner to synthetically accelerate convergence when solving \\cref{transport1} (cf. \\cite{adamslarsen} for a detailed description of synthetic acceleration). When solving \\cref{si1}, the angular flux at each iteration $m$ has an error associated with it. FPSA systematically follows a predict, correct, iterate scheme. A transport sweep, one iteration in \\cref{si1}, is made for a prediction. The FP approximation is used to correct the error in the prediction, and this iteration is performed until a convergence criterion is met. The equations used are:\n\\begin{subequations}\n\\label{fpsaeq}\n\\begin{align}\n\\label{predict}\n\\mathrm{Predict}&: \\mathcal{L} \\psi^{m+\\frac{1}{2}} = \\mathcal{S} \\psi^{m} + Q\\,,\\\\\n\\label{correct}\n\\mathrm{Correct}&: \\psi^{m+1} =  \\psi^{m+\\frac{1}{2}} + \\mathcal{P}^{-1} \\mathcal{S} \\left( \\psi^{m+\\frac{1}{2}} -  \\psi^{m}\\right),\n\\end{align}\n\\end{subequations}\nwhere we define $\\mathcal{P}$ as\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{FPSAsi1}\n\\mathcal{P} = \\mathcal{A}-\\mathcal{F} =\\underbrace{\\left(\\mu\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\sigma_a\\right)}_\\mathcal{A} - \\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{tr}}{2}\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\mu} (1-\\mu^2) \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\mu}\\right)}_\\mathcal{F},\n\\end{equation} In this synthetic acceleration method, the FP approximation is used to correct the error in each iteration of the high-order (HO) equation (\\ref{predict}). Therefore, there is no consistency between the angular moments of the flux in the HO and low-order (LO) equations. \\subsection{NFPA: Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Acceleration}\\label{NFPA}\n\nSimilar to FPSA, NFPA uses the FP approximation to accelerate the convergence of the solution. We introduce the additive term $\\hat{D}_F$ to \\cref{fp1}, obtaining the modified FP equation\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{mfp1}\n\\mu\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} + \\sigma_a \\psi = \\frac{\\sigma_{tr}}{2}\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\mu} (1-\\mu^2) \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\mu} + \\hat{D}_F + Q\\,.",
      "In order to speed up the convergence of radiative transfer in clouds, a quasi-diffusion method has been developed \\cite{aristova}. In addition, the DSA-multigrid method was developed to solve problems in electron transport more efficiently \\cite{trucksin}. One of the most recent convergence methods developed is Fokker-Planck Synthetic Acceleration (FPSA) \\cite{JapanFPSA,japanDiss}. FPSA accelerates up to $N$ moments of the angular flux and has shown significant improvement in the convergence rate for the types of problems described above. The method returns a speed-up of several orders of magnitude with respect to wall-clock time when compared to DSA  \\cite{JapanFPSA}. In this paper, we introduce a new acceleration technique, called \\textit{Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Acceleration} (NFPA). This  method  returns  a  modified  Fokker-Planck (FP) equation  that  preserves  the  angular moments of the flux given by the transport  equation. This preservation of moments is particularly appealing for applications to multiphysics problems \\cite{multiphysics}, in which the coupling between the transport physics and the other physics can be done through the (lower-order) FP equation. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a numerical method that returns a Fokker-Planck-like equation that is discretely consistent with the linear Boltzmann equation. This paper is organized as follows. \\Cref{sec2} starts with a brief description of FPSA. Then, we derive the NFPA scheme. In \\cref{sec3}, we discuss the discretization schemes used in this work and present numerical results. These are compared against standard acceleration techniques. We conclude with a discussion in \\cref{sec4}. \\section{Fokker-Planck Acceleration}\\label{sec2}\n\\setcounter{equation}{0} In this section we briefly outline the theory behind FPSA, describe NFPA for monoenergetic, steady-state transport problems in slab geometry, and present the numerical methodology behind NFPA. The theory given here can be easily extended to higher-dimensional problems."

Goodwin completed the training several weeks later and was attached to the submarine . He then continued his further training aboard submarine  and following his promotion to Lieutenant (junior grade) on June 3, 1925, he qualified as submariner. He then served aboard submarine  off the coast of California, before he was ordered for the recruiting duty to San Francisco in September 1927. While in this capacity, Goodwin applied for naval aviation training which was ultimately approved and he was ordered to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in August 1928. Toward the end of the training, he was promoted to lieutenant on December 11, 1928, and upon the completion of the training in January 1929, he was designated Naval aviator. Goodwin was subsequently attached to the Observation Squadron aboard the aircraft carrier  and participated in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean. He was transferred to the Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. in August 1931 and served consecutively under the architect of naval aviation William A. Moffett and future Chief of Naval Operations Ernest J. King. In June 1933, Goodwin was ordered to the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, where he completed junior course in May of the following year. He subsequently joined the crew of aircraft carrier  and served under Captain Arthur B. Cook and took part in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean and off the East Coast of the United States. He was ordered back to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in June 1936 and was attached to the staff of the Base Commandant, then-Captain Charles A. Blakely. When Blakely was succeeded by William F. Halsey in June 1937, Goodwin remained in Halsey's staff and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on December 1, 1937.",

His promotion was made permanent two months later and he returned to the United States in early 1943 for duty as assistant director of Planning in the Bureau of Aeronautics under Rear admiral John S. McCain. While still in Argentina, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Captain on June 21, 1942. By the end of December 1943, Goodwin was ordered to Astoria, Oregon, where he assumed command of newly commissioned escort carrier USS Gambier Bay. He was responsible for the initial training of the crew and was known as a strict disciplinarian, but the crew appreciated the skills he taught them that prepared them for combat. Goodwin insisted that everyone aboard has to do every job right every time and made us fight our ship at her best. During the first half of 1944, Gambier Bay was tasked with ferrying aircraft for repairs and qualified carrier pilots from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before departed on May 1, 1944, to join Rear admiral Harold B. Sallada's Carrier Support Group 2, staging in the Marshalls for the invasion of the Marianas."

The method is based on learning a dynamic interactive model encoding the cross-correlation between the received RF signals from multiple vehicles and their corresponding trajectories. Simulation results show the high effectiveness of the proposed approach in jointly detecting the GPS spoofer and jammer attacks. Subsequent work will extend the system model to consider more than two vehicles with different channel conditions and various modulation schemes to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. \\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}",
      "This proves that RSU learned the correct dynamic rules of how RF signals and trajectories evolve when the jammer and spoofer are absent (i.e., under normal situations). Also, we can see that the RSU can notice a high deviation on both the RF signal and the corresponding trajectory due to a jamming interference from what it has learned so far by relying on the abnormality signals. In contrast, we can see that under spoofing attacks, RSU notice a deviation only on the trajectory and not on the RF signal since the spoofer has affected only the positions without manipulating the RF signal. In addition, it is obvious how the proposed method allows the RSU to identify the type of abnormality occurring and to explain the cause of the detected abnormality (i.e., understanding if it was because of a jammer attacking the V2I link or a spoofer attacking the satellite link). \\begin{figure}[t!] \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=6.5cm]{Results/trajectories_underJamming_andSpoofing}\n   \n    \\caption{Vehicle's trajectory under: normal situation, jamming and spoofing.}\n    \\label{fig_exNormal_Spoofed_JammedTrajectories}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n    \\begin{center}\n        \\begin{minipage}[b]{.92\\linewidth}\n        \\centering\n            \\includegraphics[height=2.6cm]{Results/abnSignal_onRF}\n        \\\\[-1.5mm]\n        {\\scriptsize (a)}\n        \\end{minipage}\n        \\begin{minipage}[b]{.92\\linewidth}\n            \\centering\n            \\includegraphics[height=2.6cm]{Results/abnSignal_onGPS}\n            \\\\[-1.5mm]\n            {\\scriptsize (b)}\n        \\end{minipage}\n        %\n        \\caption{Abnormality Signals related to the example shown in Fig.\\ref{fig_exNormal_Spoofed_JammedTrajectories}: (a) abnormality indicators related to the RF signal, (b) abnormality indicators related to the trajectory.}\n            \\label{fig_abnormalitySignals_JammerSpoofer}\n    \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t!] \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[height=3.2cm]{Results/Detection_Probability_RFfromGPS_versusPj}\n    \\caption{Detection probability ($\\mathrm{P_{d}}$) versus jammer's power ($\\mathrm{P_{J}}$) using different number of clusters $\\mathrm{M}_{2}$.}\n    \\label{fig_jammerDetectionProb}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t!]"

Photo: Unknown/Norwegian Petroleum Museum\nA mere 17 months after the Ekofisk discovery was announced in December 1969, Gulftide was ready to come on stream as a temporary production platform. Its official inauguration took place on 9 June, with initial test output commencing on 15 June. Full production began on 8 July. The rig was chosen because it was available on the market. Established equipment for processing oil and gas was tailored to the limited space on board. Separate flowlines carried wellstreams from four subsea wells. Oil, gas and water were separated on board, with the gas flared and the oil piped to two buoys for loading into shuttle tankers. Work on the process equipment was relatively simple. The problem was to tailor it to the rig. The subsea wellheads had to be reinforced to meet the demands posed by the North Sea, and a buoy loading system needed to be developed for waters where this technology had never been used before. To gain time, it was decided that the three appraisal wells drilled by Ocean Viking to map the extent of the field \u2013 in addition to the discovery well \u2013 would be completed for production.

The interactive matrix $\\Phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M_{1},M_{2}}$ encodes the firing cluster pattern allowing to predict the GPS signal from RF signal is defined as follows:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{interactiveTM_fromRFtoGPS}\n\\Phi = \n        \\begin{bmatrix} \n            \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{1}}^{(2)}|\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{1}}^{(1)}) & \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{2}}^{(2)}|\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{1}}^{(1)}) & \\dots & \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{M_{2}}}^{(2)}|\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{1}}^{(1)}) \\\\\n            \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{1}}^{(2)}|\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{2}}^{(1)}) & \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{2}}^{(2)}|\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{2}}^{(1)}) & \\dots & \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{M_{2}}}^{(2)}|\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{2}}^{(1)}) \\\\\n            \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n            \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{1}}^{(2)}|\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{M_{1}}}^{(1)}) & \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{2}}^{(2)}|\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{M_{1}}}^{(1)}) & \\dots & \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{M_{2}}}^{(2)}|\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{M_{1}}}^{(1)}) \n        \\end{bmatrix}."

Treatments with drugs to be tested for their ability to inhibit transgene reactivation (ISRIB, SP600125 and U0126) were initiated 1h before the subsequent addition of L-Histidinol (ISRIB) or the subsequent depletion of Met/Cys (SP600125 and U0126). Total RNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA concentration was determined by Nanodrop 8000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).

      "Thus, while the ISR appears widely activated upon EAA starvation, the upregulation of its downstream effector CHOP only partly correlates with transgene reactivation and may not be sufficient to induce it. The activation of the ISR upon AA starvation suggests that GCN2 may be involved in the transgene reactivation response. Therefore, we tested whether direct pharmacological activation of this kinase is sufficient to trigger the transgene reactivation similarly to starvation. In addition, we used pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR to corroborate previous negative results in HeLa cells  in the other cell lines under study. To this aim, HeLa-OA1 or GFP, HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of PP242 (mTOR inhibitor) or L-Histidinol (GCN2 activator, inhibiting tRNAHis charging by histidyl-tRNA synthetase), either alone or in combination for 24 h, compared to Met/Cys-deprived and full medium. As shown in Fig 4 and S5 Fig, while inhibition of mTORC1 consistently leads to minor or no effects, in agreement with previous findings , treatment with L-Histidinol results in efficient reactivation of the transgene in HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells, but not in HeLa cells.

We computed the security parameter, wall-time and physical footprint for each cryptographic primitive. Our attack model was based on a brute force searching via a parallelized version of Grover's algorithm, assuming a surface-code fault-tolerant architecture based on defects and braiding techniques. It is worth noting that throughout we are assuming that brute-force search where we treat the cryptographic function as a black-box is essentially the optimal attack against SHA and AES, which is currently believed to be the case. Some symmetric key algorithms are susceptible in a model that permits ``superposition attacks''~\\cite{quantph.1602.05973}. In most realistic instances, these attacks are not practical, however they do shed light on the limitations of certain security proof methods in a quantum context, and remind us that we shouldn't take for granted that non-trivial attacks on symmetric key cryptography may be possible."

      "Shopping for the Partially Built KR. This story starts about twenty years ago when I first started looking at the KR-2 as the plane I'd like to build. The only problem at that time was a lack of money, lack of knowledge, and a lack of job stability. I liked the design, except for the low ground clearance of the retractable gear and that a KR was going to be a tight fit for me to fly. Over the past twenty years I've owned a number of planes, but still always wanted to build my own. I needed one that would fit me, my budget requirements, and have the speed and performance that I wanted. When \"KITPLANES\" published the article featuring Roy Marsh's new KR-2S, it was the first I had heard of any major modifications or improvements to the same old KR design. I believe that article and Roy Marsh's workmanship have probably been the greatest boon to Rand Robinson (RR) in the last twenty years. It certainly caught my eye! Here was the same design I had decided I wanted to build twenty years ago, with all of the improvements I wanted. It was sitting on fixed gear with some reasonable ground clearance. It had the capability to be built large enough to accommodate me. It has enough prefab parts available that it didn't have to be 100% scratch built if I decided to hurry the project along. And it had the speed I wanted. I knew that Roy's published speeds were probably not realistic expectations for the average KR, but after knocking around for the last three years in my Champ, anything over 90 mph seems pretty fast to me. After purchasing the info kit and the sales video from Rand Robinson, the next step after deciding for sure to build this plane was to order the KR-2 plans and the KR-2S addendum. I finally got my plans and was putting together my first order to start the plane, when my partner in the Champ pointed out that there was a partially completed KR-2S for sale in Trade-a-plane. My initial answer was \"No, I don't even want to look at it. I want to build my own from scratch.\" My partner insisted that for the advertised price and the fact that it wasn't too far away, I ought to at least give the guy a call and investigate it.",
      "They were two of the guys at the end of the DC-8,9, and 10 assembly lines responsible for correcting some of the nits and picks in various systems before delivery to the customer. They both wanted to build a fast, inexpensive airplane which was also economical to maintain. Several designs were considered, and plans were bought first for the Jeanie's Teenie and then the Taylor Monoplane. The Monoplane was more to their liking, but would require some modification to fit their needs. A cooperative redesign effort ensued, with virtually no dimensions left untouched. Only the basic fuselage structure, airfoil, and powerplant were retained. The tail shape was Stu's, and came directly from the big DC-8s parked on the ramp outside his office window. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport. Ken was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident. Ken's wife Jeanette became owner of RR overnight, and stepped up to keep the plans and parts coming. Much of the engineering needs are handled by Bill Marcy of Denver, who's been helping out since early '79. To date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5 KR2Ss now in the air. Much of the development work done on KR's is now done by the builders themselves. KR builders tend to be innovative, which leads to some interesting modifications. Some of the mods that work eventually creep into the plans. The KR2S is a case in point. Many builders who'd heard of the pitch sensitivity and tight cabin of the KR2 began to build an enlarged version, with the length determined by the most commonly available longeron material.

Higher gross weights dictated more wing area, with the new standard becoming the Diehl wing skin.

      "The results can be found in Figure and show very good agreement between predictions and reference data. This example shows that our model is successfully able to carry out dimensionality reduction and moreover indicates that the convergence rate between latent processes can be different. The latter is relevant when training models as for accurate predictions all latent processes and their dynamics should be converged. Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\n\nFinally, we applied our algorithm to the KS equation and aim to identify a reduced-order model for the solution u(y, t): We employed periodic boundary conditions, \u00b5 = 1 and a domain size y \u2208 [0, 22]. For this domain-size, the KS-equation exhibits a structurally stable chaotic attractor as discussed in The black lines divides the area for which training data was given from the area without raining data.\n; . The equation is discretized in space using a discretization step of 22 64 resulting in a state vector x of dimension 64 and a nonlinear system of coupled ODEs. This is solved using a stiff fourth-order solver  We employed a non-linear encoder and decoder with four fully-connected layers each and ReLU-activation functions as well as Dropout Layers between the fully-connected layers. We trained the model for 200000 iterations using Adam and a learning rate of 5 \u2022 10 4 and assuming a five-dimensional latent space. We obtained the \u03bb's in Figure . Four latent variables have \u03bb's close to zero and thus a slow temporal dynamic that is responsible for the long-term evolution whereas one latent variable is quickly decaying. Based on the obtained parameters, we do predictions based on an unseen initial condition not contained in the training data. We are able to reconstruct the correct phase space based on our predictions despite only using a very limited amount of training data. The results for the phase space can be seen in Figure . Although the small-scale fluctuations in the temporal dynamics are not well captured, the model identifies the correct manifold which has a good accuracy compared to the reference solution.",
      "The time-continuous formulation moreover allows to incorporate sparse and irregularly sampled training data and fast generation of predictions after the training phase. By using a complex-valued latent space we can also incorporate harmonic effects and reduce the number of latent variables needed. Linear and non-linear autoencoders are used to map the observed, high-dimensional time-series to the lower-dimensional, latent representation and we identify simultaneously the autoencoder as well as the latent dynamics by optimizing a combined loss function. Hence the to tasks of dimensionality reduction and discovery of the reduced dynamics are unified while other frameworks treat the two parts separately . Apart from using an architecture based on autoencoders to identify the latent space, projection-based methods could also be employed . We are also proposing a probabilistic version of our algorithm ) that makes use of probabilistic Slow Feature Analysis . This allows for a latent representation that arart from being time-continuous, can quantify the predictive uncertainty and hierarchically decompose the dynamics into their pertinent scales while promoting the discovery of slow processes that control the system's evolution over long time horizons. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: We introduce the methodological framework as well as algorithmic details in section II. Particular focus is paid on the interpretability of the inferred lower-dimensional dynamics. In section III we present three numerical illustrations, i.e. a system of linear ODEs, a hidden Markov Model and the discretized KS-equation. We then present in section IV the probabilistic extension of the framework and apply it to the KS-equation. We conclude with a summary and a short discussion about possible next steps. We introduce the autoencoders deployed in this work, followed by the interpretable latent space dynamic and discuss the training process. We consider data from high-dimensional time series x n \u2208 R f with n = 1, ..., T ."

He says they have become a bit like God's lobbyists for the poor, putting a theological and moral spin on the cuts. Wallis said he is all for deficit reduction but --\nWALLIS: I don't think doing this at the expense of the poorest people is a good choice, or hurting those who are already hurting the most is moral or even is smart.\nSYLVESTER: Fiscal conservatives have suggested cuts in food stamps, foreign aid, and preschool programs for low-income families, that private groups can and should provide for the needy. But David Beckman of Bread for the World, who used to work at the World Bank, says the private sector can't fill the gap. DAVID BECKMAN, PRESIDENT, BREAD FOR THE WORLD: All the private charitable feeding in the country amounts to about six percent of the food that poor people get from the national programs. So if you slash food stamps, as the House Republicans are proposing to do, there is no way that churches and charities and charitable people can make up for that.\nSYLVESTER: Tony Hall was a member of Congress for years. As part of the fast, he is urging his former colleagues to reconsider cuts.\nTONY HALL, ALLIANCE TO END HUNGER: When you make decisions about people's lives, be careful. You don't cut the poorest of the poor, because they didn't get you here. They didn't cause this mess. SYLVESTER: On Wednesday, members of Congress began signing up for the fast.\nREP.

Ninety-seven percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides are preventive care. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I certainly don't think that taxpayers should subsidize abortions. It's -- if a woman chooses to have an abortion, it's legal to do that in this country. But I don't think taxpayers should be put in a position to have to pay for those abortions. BASH: Another major sticking point -- how much spending to cut. A Democratic source tells CNN they have finally tentative agreement on slashing $34.5 billion from the rest of this year's budget. But a Republican source says there's no deal. BOEHNER: There is no agreement on the number. There are no agreement on the policy issues that are contained with it.\nBASH: Then there's the critical issue of what programs and agencies to cut. Democrats say they're trying to find spending cuts with the least impact on those who need it most. So they're pushing for things like temporary one year cuts in programs. Some examples, cuts in wetlands protection and Pell grants for summer school and graduate students. Republicans call that smoke and mirrors. BOEHNER: And our goal is to make real spending cuts. BASH: Some examples of what Republicans want to cut -- money for food inspectors, Head Start education programs and funding for housing. BASH: This afternoon, House Republicans did pass a bill to keep the government running for one week past tomorrow's midnight deadline. It has $12 billion in cuts. It would fund the Defense Department for the rest of the year. But Democrats, including the president of the United States, call it a distraction and they say that they really want to keep the focus on what they're negotiating, which is a bill that would keep the government open -- keep the government functioning and funded for the rest of the year.\nBLITZER:"

City Mangler Dave Burkland won\u2019t make her. Last month she actually admitted, she is UNABLE to do it. At the June 5 meeting she admitted that she is incompetent to follow the city charter. She said that when she came to her position seven years ago, she \u201cstruggled\u201d with doing such a report \u2013 something every house wife does \u2013 and went whining to then-city-manager Tom Lando, who apparently patted her on the head and told her she didn\u2019t have to do it anymore.

I\u2019ve found big, dumb mistakes, in the 100\u2019s column even, that could have caused big, dumb problems down the road. I\u2019m no math instructor, like Mary Goloff, but it\u2019s not exactly rocket science \u2013 you just add your deposits and subtract your checks and withdrawals.

My husband and son are enjoying a weekend trip right now that is already paid for, thankyouverymuch. But Jennifer Hennessy is unable to do that? And she has expectable stuff \u2013 over 80 percent of her budget is payroll. She doesn\u2019t have that many emergencies. The biggest emergency she\u2019s had lately, is that the state has taken back the fund she\u2019s been mis-using \u2013 the RDA. She was paying salaries and benefits out of a fund that\u2019s supposed to be reserved for emergency public works projects.

Toby Schindelbeck has finally been rewarded for his persistence \u2013 he\u2019s been going before Chico City Council, asking that Finance MisDirector Jennifer Hennessy comply with city code and give a budget report at every meeting. City clerk Debbie Presson has informed him that this subject will be \u201cdiscussed\u201d at the August 7 council meeting. But we know, it won\u2019t be a very good \u201cdiscussion\u201d unless a bunch of people come in and demand some action.

The city has acted on these issues, with only that small fraction of the population in support. So, Toby believes there needs to be an even stronger presence to get a decent discussion on this matter, and I agree. Like Toby and Stephanie Taber and others have been saying, the city code calls for a monthly budget report, with sticky details like receipts, etc, and Jennifer Hennessy admits she has not made such a report in the seven years she\u2019s been with the city of Chico. Try not paying your taxes for seven years \u2013 you\u2019ll get the same treatment as the man from Touch of Class Florist \u2013 68 years old, and he\u2019s being sent to PRISON. But Jennifer Hennessy and her boss Dave Burkland, and their overseer, Mayor Ann Schwab, get to flog the law right in front of everybody, and Ann just steps right into that little red convertible and drives off to her palatial estate in Forest Ranch. The law is a piece of paper. It takes people to demand law enforcement. We\u2019ve got a serious law enforcement problem in our town. The police say they aren\u2019t paid enough to enforce the laws in the streets, and now Dave Burkland says, he just doesn\u2019t have to. And your mayor won\u2019t make him either.

      "Removing the easy vertices reduces the total number of vertices, making the conflict optimizer more effective. The Shadoks always toggle this option on (the challenge instances contain from 0 to 23% easy vertices). Results\n\nWe provide the results of the experiments performed with the code from the three teams on two classes of instances. First, we present the results on some selected CG:SHOP 2022 instances. These instances are intersection graphs of line segments. Second, we execute the code on graphs that are not intersection graphs, namely the classic DIMACS graphs , comparing the results of our conflict optimizer implementations to previous solutions. The source code for the three teams is available at: \u2022 Lasa: https://github.com/librallu/dogs-color \u2022 Gitastrophe: https://github.com/jacketsj/cgshop2022-gitastrophe \u2022 Shadoks: https://github.com/gfonsecabr/shadoks-CGSHOP2022\n\nCG:SHOP 2022 Instances\n\nWe selected 14 instances (out of 225) covering the different types of instances given in the CG:SHOP 2022 challenge. The results are presented in Table . For comparison, we executed the HEAD code on some instances using the default parameters. The table shows the smallest number of colors for which HEAD found a solution. We ran HEAD for 1 hour of repetitions for each target number of colors on a single CPU core (the HEAD solver takes the target number of colors as a parameter and we increased this parameter one by one). At the end of the challenge, 8 colorings computed by Lasa, 11 colorings computed by Gitastrophe, and 23 colorings computed by Shadoks over 225 instances have been proved optimal (their number of colors is equal to the size of a clique). In order to compare the efficiency of the algorithms, we executed the different implementations on the CG:SHOP instance vispecn13806. The edge density of this graph is 19%, the largest clique that we found has 177 vertices and the best coloring found during the challenge uses 218 colors. Notice that vispecn13806 is the same instance used in other Shadoks experiments in Section 5.",
      "Adding the conflict-minimization phase gave minor improvements to some of the challenge instances. Shadoks\n\nIn this section, we describe the choices used by the Shadoks team for the options described in Section 2.1. The Shadoks generally chose to eliminate the color with the smallest number of elements. However, if the multistart option is toggled on, then a random color is used each time. The conflict set S is stored in a queue. The Shadoks tried other strategies, but found that the queue gives the best results. The weight function used is w(u) = 1 + q(u) p , mostly with p = 1.2. The effect of the parameter p is shown in Fig. . Notice that in all figures, the number of colors shown is the average of ten executions of the code using different random seeds. The algorithm uses \u03c3 = 0.15, easy vertices, q max = 59022, but does not use the BDFS nor any clique. If q(u) is larger than a threshold q max , the Shadoks set w(u) = \u221e so that the vertex u never reenters S. If at some point an uncolored vertex v is adjacent to some vertex u of infinite weight in every color class, then the conflict optimizer is restarted. When restarting, the initial coloring is shuffled by moving some vertices from their initial color class to a new one. Looking at Fig. , the value of q max does not seem to have much influence as long as it is not too small. Throughout the challenge the Shadoks almost exclusively used q max = 2000 \u2022 (75000/m) 2 , where m is the number of vertices. This value roughly ensures a restart every few hours. q max =0.5k q max =5k q max =50k q max =100k q max =250k The Shadoks use the function f as a Gaussian random variable of mean 1 and variance \u03c3. A good default value is \u03c3 = 0.15. The effect of the variance is shown in Fig. . Notice that setting \u03c3 = 0 gives much worse results. Option (e) The goal of BDFS is to further optimize very good solutions that the conflict optimizer is not able to improve otherwise. Fig. shows the influence of BDFS. While on this figure, the advantages of BDFS cannot be noticed, its use near the end of the challenge improved about 30 solutions."

      "The metric score is the mean of the vector. Because of the invariance of CCA to affine transformations , in this procedure, we only need to ensure that the stimulus dimension is consistent and aligned, even if the unit/neuron dimension is different. Dimensionality reduction plays an important role in this method to make the number of model features comparable to the number of neurons in cortical regions, since the former usually far exceeds the latter. In addition, dimensionality reduction helps to determine which features are important to the original data, while CCA suffers in important feature detection. Using just CCA performs badly, which has been proven by . To check how similar the models are to the visual cortex's mechanisms in visual processing, we rank the final similarity scores of all models and conduct comparisons among three types of models (CNNs, SNNs, and vision transformers). Specially, we focus on comparing SNN (SEW ResNet) and CNN (ResNet) with the same depth and almost the same architectures (Figure ). The final similarity score of a model is the average similarity score across all cortical regions. (The overall rankings can be found in Appendix B and the comparisons among three types of models are shown in Appendix C.) Allen brain mouse dataset. No single model achieves the highest final similarity scores with all three metrics. For a fair comparison, we apply the paired t-test to SEW ResNet and ResNet with the same depth. For all three metrics, SEW ResNet performs better than ResNet by a large margin (t = 5.857, p = 0.004; t = 7.666, p = 0.002; t = 7.592, p = 0.002) 1 . 1 The results of the three similarity metrics are separated by semicolons, in the order of SVCCA, TSVD-Reg, and RSA. Other Macaque-Face dataset. For both SVCCA and TSVD-Reg, Wide-SEW-ResNet14 and Wide-SEW-ResNet8 achieve the first and second highest final similarity scores respectively. But for RSA, TNT-S and Inception-ResNet-V2 take their place and outperform other models by a large margin. As for SEW ResNet and ResNet, the former performs significantly better than the latter for both SVCCA and TSVD-Reg (t = 8.195, p = 0.001; t = 7.528, p = 0.002).",
      "In fact, some studies using multiple pathways simulate the functions of mouse visual cortex to some extent . Our results further suggest that not only the mouse visual cortex might be an organization of parallel structures, but also there are extensive parallel information processing streams between each pair of cortical regions . For the two macaque datasets with different stimuli, not only are the model rankings significantly different, but also the correlations between the similarity scores and the model depth are totally opposite. These results corroborate the following two processing mechanisms in macaques: the ventral visual stream of primate visual cortex possesses canonical coding principles at different stages; the brain exhibits a high degree of functional specialization, such as the visual recognition of faces and other objects, which is reflected in the different neural responses of the corresponding region (although the face patch AM is a sub-network of IT, they differ in the neural representations). Besides, as shown in Figure , The calculation and plotting of the trajectories are the same as Figure . the similarity scores of vision transformers reach the maximum in the early layers and then decrease. Differently, the scores of CNNs and SNNs keep trending upwards, reaching the maximum in almost the last layer. On the other hand, Appendix C shows that vision transformers perform well in Macaque-Face dataset but poorly in Macaque-Synthetic dataset. Considering the features extraction mechanism of vision transformers, it divides the image into several patches and encodes each patch as well as their internal relation by self-attention. This mechanism is effective for face images that are full of useful information. However, the synthetic image consists of a central target object and a naturalistic background. When vision transformers are fed with this type of stimuli, premature integration of global information can lead to model representations containing noise from the unrelated background."

      "We find that as the quark mass becomes large, spatial mesons hoppings (i.e.\nspatial dimers) become rare, which makes this 3+1-dimensional system closer to 1dim. QCD . Also, both the baryon mass and the baryon chemical potential obtained in our dual representation, i.e. for staggered fermions, approaches the baryon mass of the 3-dim. effective theory which is based on Wilson fermions. Another comparison that summarizes the validity of the mean field approach discussed in Section II B is shown in Fig. . It is evident that mean field theory has strong deviations for small quark masses, but this discrepancy becomes smaller for larger quark masses. The extension of the study of the nuclear transition to finite inverse gauge coupling \u03b2 is summarized in Fig. , which shows the \u03b2-dependence of a\u00b5 c B for various quark masses. For all quark masses ranging from am q = 0 to am q = 1.0, there is only a very weak \u03b2-dependence, confirming the expectation from mean field theory . This works was restricted to isotropic lattices \u03be = a/a t = 1, i.e. we performed simulations at fixed temperature. Non-isotropic lattices are necessary to vary the temperature at fixed values of \u03b2. This requires to include two bare anisotropies, \u03b3 for the fermionic action and \u03b3 G for the gauge action. Finite \u03b2 has only been studied by us in the chiral limit . Clearly, it is interesting to study the location of the nuclear critical point also including higher order gauge corrections and at finite quark mass. Simulations including O(\u03b2 2 ) are under preparation.",
      "Strong Coupling\n\nWithout any further resummation, there is a mild sign problem in the dual formulation of lattice QCD in the strong coupling limit. When the average sign \u03c3 is not too small (close to zero), it implies that most of the configurations have a positive weight thus allowing us to perform sign reweighting strategies. In Fig. , \u2206f is plotted as a function of the baryon chemical potential and the quark masses. It is seen that \u2206f is close to zero for most cases except near the critical chemical potential and for small quark masses, but never exceeds 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . Hence sign reweighting can be performed in the full parameter space. The result that the sign problem becomes even milder when increasing the mass is related to the fact that larger critical chemical potentials result in a larger fraction of static baryons (spatial baryon hoppings become rare). FIG. . \u2206F at strong coupling as a function of chemical potential and quark mass on a 6 3 \u00d7 8. The sign problem becomes milder as the quark mass increases. Finite \u03b2\n\nAll runs at finite \u03b2 have been obtained for N \u03c4 = 4, which corresponds to a moderately low temperature aT = 0.25 compared to the value of the chiral transition aT 1.54. Those simulations were too expensive to attempt N \u03c4 = 8 runs, in particular as a higher statistics was required. The spatial volumes are 4 3 , 6 3 and 8 3 . For \u03b2 values are from 0.0 to 1.0 with step size 0.1, and for am q values from 0.00 to 1.00 with step size 0.01. The values of a\u00b5 were chosen close to the nuclear transition, the scanning range is shifted to large values as am q increases. At small quark masses the scanning range is from a\u00b5 = 0.4 to 1.0 and for the large quark masses, it is from 0.6 to 1.2 with step size 0.01. The statistics used for are 15 \u00d7 10 4 measurements and between measurement, 40 \u00d7 N 3 s worm updates.

I certainly agree with the term \"biological machinery,\" which is to say that there is no reason to distinguish things simply on the basis that one uses the interactions of organic chemistry. Thus I think the locus of difference between the living organism and the machine has to do with origins whether it is by design or by learning, evolution, and self-organization.

Even the Mafia got in on the Florida oxy express action: A Bonanno crime family associate oversaw a local crew stocking up on Palm Beach and Broward pain clinic oxycodone, upstreaming profits to the New York family. At times, it seemed almost no section of the country was free of Florida-supplied pills: When Olubenga Badamosi was arrested driving his Bentley Continental in Miami in 2011, the Oregon man was one of two traffickers overseeing a crew smuggling South Florida oxycodone to sell in Salt Lake City, Seattle and Denver as well as Oregon, Nevada, Texas and even Alaska.

Small wonder: Of the nation\u2019s top 100 oxycodone-buying doctors, 90 were in Florida. Pharmacies, too, ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "In DBM modeling, the CE multiscale analysis is used to determine quickly the reserved kinetic moments. Specifically, when constructing a DBM which only the first order term of Kn number is retained (i.e., only the first order TNE effects are retained), seven kinetic moments should be reserved, i.e., the M 0 , M 1 , M 2,0 , M 2 , M 3,1 , M 3 , M 4,2 . Two more kinetic moments ( M 4 and M 5,3 ) are needed when the second order TNE is considered . However, it should be noted that the function of CE analysis in DBM modeling is only to determine the kinetic moments that need to be preserved. Whether or not to derive the hydrodynamic equations does not affect the DBM simulation. The kinetic moments used in our physical modeling are shown in the Appendix B. Their expressions can be obtained by integrating v and \u03b7 with continuous-form f eq . For better understanding, the Appendix C gives the two-fluid hydrodynamic equations recovered from the Boltzmann equation. The kinetic moments in Appendix B can be written in matrix form, i.e., C \u2022 f \u03c3 ,eq = f\u03c3,eq , (\nwhere C is the matrix of discrete velocity and feq represents the kinetic moments. A proper discrete velocity model is needed to confirm the values of f \u03c3 ,eq i . The f \u03c3 ,eq can be obtained by solving the inverse matrix, i.e., f \u03c3 ,eq = C \u22121 \u2022 f\u03c3,eq , where C \u22121 is the inverse matrix of C. It is very convenient to obtain the inverse matrix of C through some mathematical softwares such as Mathematica, etc. The D2V16 model is chosen in this paper, its sketches can be seen in Fig. . The specific values of D2V16 are given in the following equations: where \"cyc\" indicates cyclic permutation and c is an adjustable parameter of the discrete velocity model. The sketch of \u03b7 in D2V16 is \u03b7 i = \u03b7 0 for i = 1 \u2212 4, and \u03b7 i = 0 for i = 5 \u2212 16. Checking the TNE state and extracting TNE information\n\nMany physical quantities can characterize the degree of TNE in a fluid system, such as relaxation time, Kn number, viscosity, heat conduction, the gradients of macroscopic quantity, etc.",
      "With increasing the Kn number, to ensure the describing capability not to decrease significantly, the more appropriate hydrodynamic equations should be the Extended Hydrodynamic Equations (EHEs) which include not only the evolution equations of conserved kinetic moments but also the most relevant nonconserved kinetic moments of distribution function. For convenience of description we refer the modeling method that derives EHEs from the fundamental kinetic equation to Kinetic Macroscopic Modeling (KMM) method. It is clear that, the complex process of CE expansion is necessary and the simulation is still based on the macroscopic equations in KMM. As a comparison, the DBM is a kind of Kinetic Direct Modeling (KDM) method. In DBM modeling, the CE analysis is only used to quickly determine which kinetic moments should keep values unchanged, the final EHEs are not needed, and the simulation is not based on the complicated EHEs. As the TNE degree of the flow to be described rises gradually, the complexity of the derivation process and difficulty of numerical simulation in the KMM method increase sharply. However, in the DBM method, to describe flows in a one-order more deeper depth of TNE, only two more related kinetic moments need to be added. Since without needing to derive and solve the EHEs, as the TNE degree deepens, the complexity of the DBM approach increases much slower than that of KMM method. The core step in DBM modeling is to provide a feasible scheme for detecting, describing, presenting, and analyzing TNE effects and behaviors beyond traditional macroscopic modeling. Based on the non-equilibrium statistical physics, we can use the non-conservative moments of ( f \u2212 f eq ) to describe how and how much the system deviates from the thermodynamic equilibrium state and to check corresponding effects due to deviating from the thermodynamic equilibrium. The non-conservative moments of ( f \u2212 f eq ) open a phase space, and this space and its subspaces provide an intuitive geometric correspondence for describing complex TNE system properties."

      "Remarkably, the hypothesis that large price movements (positive or negative) follow a power-law distribution is never rejected over the entire history of about 70% of all digital currencies in our dataset. This analysis also shows that only \u22482% of cryptocurrencies reject the power-law hypothesis in more than half of the positions of the expanding time window ( f r \u2265 0.5). For instance, considering a 10% threshold as a criterion ( f r \u2264 0.1), we find that about 85% of cryptocurrencies have return distributions adequately modeled by power laws. Increasing this threshold to a more lenient 20% threshold ( f r \u2264 0.2), we find large price movements to be power-law distributed for about 91% of cryptocurrencies. These results thus provide strong evidence that cryptoassets, fairly generally, present large price movements quite well described by power-law distributions. Moreover, this conclusion is robust when starting the expanding window with a greater . Large price movements are power-law distributed over the entire history of most cryptocurrencies with median values typically smaller than those found for traditional assets. (a) Percentage of cryptoassets rejecting the power-law hypothesis for large positive (blue) or negative (red) price returns in at most a given fraction of the weekly positions of the expanding time window ( f r ) used to sample the return series. Remarkably, 68% of all 7111 digital currencies are compatible with the power-law hypothesis over their entire history, and about 91% of them reject the power-law hypothesis in less than 20% of the positions of the expanding time window ( f r \u2264 0.2). (b) Probability distributions obtained via kernel density estimation of the median values of the power-law exponents along the history of each digital currency. The blue curve shows the distribution of the median exponents related to positive returns ( \u03b1+ ) and the red curve does the same for negative returns ( \u03b1\u2212 ). The medians of \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 are indicated by vertical dashed lines.",
      "Panels (c) and (d) show the distributions of these median exponents when considering the top 2000 and the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, respectively. We observe that the distributions of \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 tend to shift toward larger values when considering the largest cryptoassets. number of return observations (between 100 and 300 days) and filtering out cryptoassets with missing observations (Supplementary Figures ). Still, it is worth noticing the existence of a few cryptoassets (9 of them) with relatively small market capitalization (ranking below the top 1000) for which the power-law hypothesis is always rejected (Supplementary Table ). Having verified that large price movements in the cryptocurrency market are generally well-described by powerlaw distributions, we now focus on the power-law exponents that typically characterize each cryptoasset. To do so, we select all exponent estimates over the entire history of each digital asset for which the power-law hypothesis is not rejected and calculate their median values for both the positive ( \u03b1+ ) and negative ( \u03b1\u2212 ) returns. The dashed lines in Fig. ) show these median values for Bitcoin where \u03b1+ = 4.50 and \u03b1\u2212 = 2.99. It is worth noticing that the variance of large price movements \u03c3 2 is finite only for \u03b1 > 3, as the integral \u03c3 2 \u223c \u221e r min r 2 p(r)dr diverges outside this interval. Thus, while the typical variance of large positive returns is finite for Bitcoin, negative returns are at the limit of not having a typical scale and are thus susceptible to much larger variations. Figure shows the probability distribution for the median power-law exponents of all cryptoassets grouped by large positive and negative returns. We note that the distribution of typical power-law exponents associated with large positive returns is shifted to smaller values when compared with the distribution of exponents related to large negative returns. The medians of these typical exponents are respectively 2.78 and 3.11 for positive and negative returns."

      "Our codes and appendix are available at https://github.com/Grasshlw/SNN-Neural-Similarity. There are plenty of computational models of macaque and mouse visual systems for exploring the visual processing mechanisms recently. We summarize some of the outstanding work in the following. The network models of macaque visual system. In the early days, studies basically used simple feedforward neural networks as the models of the macaque visual system (Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte 2014; . Recently, some bio-inspired or more complex models achieved better performance in fitting the neural representations of macaque visual cortex . proposed a brainlike shallow CNN with recurrent connections to better match the macaque ventral visual stream. By mimicking the primary stage of the primate visual system, VOneNets ) performed more robustly in image recognition while better simulating macaque V1. Moreover, the representations learned by unsupervised neural networks ) also effectively matched the neural activity of macaque ventral visual stream. Although the above work developed many bio-inspired structures, the networks are still traditional ANNs in nature. Our work introduces deep SNNs for the first time to explore the visual processing mechanisms of macaque visual system. The network models of mouse visual system. Largescale mouse neural dataset provided an experimental basis for model studies of mouse visual system (de Vries et al. 2020; . conducted comparisons between the representations of mouse visual cortex and the VGG16 trained on the Im-ageNet dataset. In , they developed a single neural network to model both the dorsal and ventral pathways with showing the functional specializations. What's more, a large survey of advanced deep networks ) revealed some hierarchy and functional properties of mice. Similar to the studies of macaque visual system, deep SNNs have never been used to model the mouse visual system. In this work, we not only use SNNs as one of the candidates to fit the representations of mouse visual cortex, but also conduct direct comparisons between macaques and mice to further investigate the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the two species.",
      "Depths of the layers with the highest similarity scores exhibit little differences across mouse cortical regions, but vary significantly across macaque regions, suggesting that the visual processing structure of mice is more regionally homogeneous than that of macaques. Besides, the multi-branch structures observed in some top mouse brain-like neural networks provide computational evidence of parallel processing streams in mice, and the different performance in fitting macaque neural representations under different stimuli exhibits the functional specialization of information processing in macaques. Taken together, our study demonstrates that SNNs could serve as promising candidates to better model and explain the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the visual system. Originally, the prototype of deep neural networks is inspired by the biological vision system . To date, deep neural networks not only occupy an unassailable position in the field of computer vision , but also become better models of the biological visual cortex compared to traditional models in the neuroscience community (Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte 2014; . They have been successful at predicting the neural responses in primate visual cortex, matching the hierarchy of ventral visual stream (G\u00fcc \u00b8l\u00fc and van Gerven 2015; , and even controlling neural activity . Moreover, as training paradigms of mice and techniques for collecting neural activity (de Vries et al. 2020) have been greatly improved, there is a strong interest in exploring mouse visual cortex. Deep neural networks also play an important role in revealing the functional mechanisms and structures of mouse visual cortex . Compared to biological networks, Artificial Neural Networks discard the complexity of neurons . Spiking Neural Networks, incorporating the concept of time and spikes, are more biologically plausible models . To be more specific, because of their capabilities of encoding information with spikes, capturing the dynamics of biological neurons, and extracting spatio-temporal features, deep SNNs are highly possible to yield brain-like representations )."

      "These broadcasters were supported by producers such as Bruce Huff, Rob Pendleton, Alison Brown, Jean Bjorgen, David Elvin (who Vogel dubbed the \"Steven Spielberg of Talk Radio\"), Mitch Berg and others. The station has, for the most part, emphasized local hosts over the years. But in 1988, KSTP was one of Rush Limbaugh's first affiliates when his conservative talk show was rolled out for national syndication. (Clear Channel-owned KTLK-FM took over rights to Limbaugh's show in January 2006). Other syndicated hosts previously heard on KSTP include Sean Hannity, Bruce Williams, Larry King, and Owen Spann. Sports Radio\nKSTP switched to Sports Radio on February 15, 2010. As the station had to wait for ESPN's contract with rival KFAN and its sister station KFXN to expire, it did not become an ESPN Radio affiliate until April 12, the same day that the Minnesota Twins were scheduled to play the first game in their new ball park, Target Field, against the Boston Red Sox. As a result Coast to Coast AM and Live on Sunday Night, it's Bill Cunningham were retained during this period. One ESPN Radio network program, The Herd with Colin Cowherd, was picked up by KSTP immediately following the format change. In 2018, the station was approved for an FM translator on 94.1 FM, broadcasting from a transmitter atop the IDS Center in downtown Minneapolis. The two-watt signal threw most of its power to the west, preventing interference to low powered FM stations on the same channel including WFNU-LP in St. Paul. With only two watts of power, however, the signal was limited to the immediate downtown area surrounding the IDS Center. It later acquired a 250 watt translator, K235BP at 94.9 MHz. The original translator was discontinued. On January 15, 2019, KSTP rebranded as \"SKOR North\" (a reference to the Vikings team song/chant, \"Skol, Vikings\"), with local programming between 12 noon and 7 pm. About a year later, in May of 2020, KSTP suspended most of its local programming and laid off nearly all of its local staff.",
      "An FM station, KSTP-FM, was founded in 1946 but shut down in 1952. Hubbard reportedly acquired an RCA TV camera in 1939, and started experimenting with television broadcasts. But World War II put a hold on the development of television. In 1948, with the war over, KSTP-TV became the first television station in Minnesota. With KSTP 1500 already associated with NBC Radio, KSTP-TV became an NBC Television Network affiliate. From 1946 to 1952, KSTP also had an FM counterpart. KSTP-FM 102.1 was only on the air four years. There were few radios equipped to receive FM signals in that era, and management decided to discontinue FM broadcasts. MOR and Top 40\nAs network programming moved from radio to television, KSTP programmed a full service Middle of the Road (MOR) radio format, in the shadow of its chief competitor, CBS Radio affiliate 830 WCCO. In 1965, a new FM station, reviving the KSTP-FM call sign, was put on the air, largely simulcasting the AM station. But by the late 1960s, KSTP-FM began a separate format of beautiful music. KSTP was the radio home of the Minnesota Vikings football team from 1970 to 1975. In 1973, KSTP broke away from its longtime adult MOR sound and became one of four area stations at the time to program a Top 40 format. \"15 KSTP, The Music Station\" competed with Top 40 AM rivals WDGY, KDWB and later, WYOO. The competition would eventually shake itself out, with outrageous rocker WYOO dropping out after being sold in 1976, and then the staid WDGY switching to country music the following year. As for uptempo hits station 15 KSTP, it went from a tight Top 40 format to leaning adult rock in 1978, to leaning adult contemporary in 1979, to evolving into adult contemporary/talk by 1980. In 1982, it officially shifted to talk. Most Top 40 rock music, by this time, had moved to the FM band. Past Personalities\n\nNotable hosts who have been on KSTP include John Hines, Jesse Ventura, Larry Carolla, Tom Barnard, Big Al Davis, Don Vogel, John MacDougall, Griff, Mike Edwards, Geoff Charles, Joe Soucheray, James Lileks, Leigh Kamman, Barbara Carlson, Peter Thiele, Tom Mischke, Jason Lewis, Chuck Knapp, Machine Gun Kelly, Charle Bush, Mark O'Connell and Paul Brand."

      "$T_{B}>T_{C}$. Meanwhile Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters start to form. Finally for higher $T_{g}$, the magnetic contribution from Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters keeps increasing while the nanocolumns signal progressively disappears. \\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\center\n   \\includegraphics[width=.6\\linewidth]{./fig7a.eps}\n   \\includegraphics[width=.3\\linewidth]{./fig7b.eps}\n\\caption{(a) Temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization (in $\\mu_{B}$/Mn) of Ge$_{0.93}$Mn$_{0.07}$ samples for different growth temperatures.

After annealing, the magnetic signal mostly arises from Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters. (b) ZFC-FC measurements performed on Ge$_{0.93}$Mn$_{0.07}$ samples for different growth temperatures. The in-plane applied field is 0.015 T. The ZFC peak at low temperature ($\\leq$150 K) can be attributed to the superparamagnetic nanocolumns. This peak widens and shifts towards high blocking temperatures when increasing growth temperature. The second peak above 150 K in the ZFC curve which increases with increasing growth temperature is attributed to superparamagnetic Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters. The increasing ZFC-FC irreversibility at $\\approx$ 300 K is due to the increasing contribution from large ferromagnetic Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters.

Figure 7b displays the corresponding Zero Field Cooled - Field Cooled (ZFC-FC) curves recorded at 0.015 Tesla.",
      "In Fig. 12b, in-plane and out-of-plane ZFC curves nearly superimpose for $T\\leq$150 K due to the isotropic magnetic behavior of the nanocolumns: in-plane magnetoelastic anisotropy is still compensating out-of-plane shape anisotropy. Moreover the magnetic signal above 150 K corresponding to Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters that start to form in this growth temperature range is strongly anisotropic. This perpendicular anisotropy confirms the epitaxial relation: (0002) Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ $\\parallel$ (002) Ge discussed in Ref.\\cite{Bihl06}. The magnetic easy axis of the clusters lies along the hexagonal $c$-axis which is perpendicular to the film plane. \\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\center\n   \\includegraphics[width=.35\\linewidth]{./fig13a.eps}\n   \\includegraphics[width=.63\\linewidth]{./fig13b.eps} \n\\caption{(a) ZFC-FC measurements performed on a Ge$_{0.887}$Mn$_{0.113}$ sample grown at 145$^{\\circ}$C.

Superparamagnetic nanostructures are investigated performing ZFC-FC measurements at different $T_{0}$ temperatures (Fig. 13a). The first ZFC peak at low temperature \\textit{i.e.} $\\leq$ 150 K is attributed to  low-$T_{C}$ nanocolumns ($T_{C}\\approx$130 K). This peak is wider than for lower growth temperatures and its maximum is further shifted up to 30 K. These results are in agreement with TEM observations: increasing $T_{g}$ leads to larger nanocolumns (\\textit{i.e.} higher blocking temperatures) and wider size distributions. ZFC-FC irreversibility is observed up to the Curie temperature due to the presence of ferromagnetic columns. The second peak above 180 K in the ZFC curve is attributed to Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters and the corresponding ZFC-FC irreversibility persisting up to 300 K means that some clusters are ferromagnetic."

      "While these service provisioning scenarios are relevant to overall 5G, they are also significantly related to the case of IoT-MDM system/services. Figure 3 Scenarios for 5G cybersecurity provisioning [Adapted from 35]. As a result, we find four major drivers of security, which potentially will come with new business opportunities in the 5G era. Device driven security comprises distributed and D2D security techniques. Platform driven security will focus on centralized and D2D security techniques. Whereas, network infrastructure driven security should focus on centralized and infrastructure security methods. Lastly, location driven security should harness distributed and infrastructure security techniques. In a quest to identify potential business entities operating in each of the quadrants relevant to device management, we recognize a \u2018secure device manufacturer/provider\u2019 focuses on device-driven security. Currently, multiple device manufacturers are developing devices where security features are built-in, regardless of which network or websites the users are accessing. This built-in security can be offered to multiple kinds of devices including smartphones, tablets, pcs, wearables, and even to IoT devices with communication and computation capability. These secure devices are built in a way that it will control access to potentially harmful networks, websites, and content; even without any commercially available security applications installed. However, when a customer enterprise (e.g. the future digital hospital) is buying a fleet of hundreds of such secure devices, the question raises how to manage and configure all these devices from time-to-time. In such a case, even the secure devices will need IoT-MDM services for proper management and seamless upgrading when needed. For the platform-driven security, we observe a \u2018traditional IoT-MDM system provider\u2019 can be a good example. In many cases, IoT-MDM system providers are selling there device management systems to enterprises directly.",
      "The coming of fifth generation (5G) of telecommunications networks is seen to result in this kind of disruption. As we are gradually moving towards 5G, it is worthwhile to theorize how the security scenario in a futures digital hospital would look like, and what relevant business possibilities could emerge from cybersecurity in the healthcare context. From this perspective, in this paper, we open up discussions on business possibilities relevant to Internet of Things mobile device management for critical infrastructures such as future digital hospital. We apply business models as a conceptual lens to analyze how cybersecurity business could evolve for 5G enabled IoT device management providers as a cybersecurity vendor. A futures digital hospital facility is envisioned to consist tech-aided advanced critical medical devices, intelligent information systems, digital communication tools, hundreds of handheld mobile devices (smartphones, tablets), wireless clinical wearables, in addition to thousands of smart IoT nodes [6, 7]. These devices should be fully integrated to improve staff productivity, hospital functions, patient safety and privacy, and, overall improve patient experience through secure and reliable healthcare services. However, inclusion of these various kinds of digital devices to the hospital context make the overall device network quite complex and heterogeneous . Thus, from a critical infrastructures view point, to manage, configure, update and secure the immense fleet of digital devices besides all the high-tech medical equipment, the futures digital hospital will need to redefine device management policy and services . Mobile device management (MDM) systems are usually referred to \u201csupport centralized control of an entire fleet of mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) and mobile applications by applying and ensuring pre-defined configuration settings\u201d [8, 9]. In the scope of this paper, we broadly use the term IoT-MDM to refer to a device management system that is capable of managing, configuring and updating both handheld mobile devices and IoT devices in combination in a centralized manner."

The same trend can be seen when using the exponential and Henyey-Greenstein kernels. \\begin{figure}[H]\n\\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.15,angle=0]{relerrorlog.jpg}\n  \\caption{Log Scale of $\\%$ Relative Error vs $\\eta$ for Problem 1 at the Center of the Slab with SRK}\n  \\label{momcomp}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsubsection{EK: Exponential Kernel}\n\nThe exponential kernel \\cite{pomraning2, JapanFPSA} is a fictitious kernel made for problems that have a valid Fokker-Planck limit \\cite{pomraning1}.

The deconvolution framework takes a known signal (hand gesture effects) and a equalizer parameter ($\\lambda$) as input and provides an Approximately Sparse Factor signal (postural activity effects) as output. For 3-axis ACC signals, we need to learn associated 3 equalizer parameters for each hand gesture. Moreover, each equalizer parameter is involved with 4 postural activities that results a total 96 ($8\\times 3\\times 4$) equalizer parameters to learn. {\\it Learning Classification Model:} We use the Approximately Sparse Factor signal to extract 12 statistical features and SVM with sequential machine optimization (SMO) \\cite{cao06} for postural activity recognition. {\\it Prediction Model:} After recognizing the hand gestures following the method explained in Sec.~\\ref{sec:hand_gesture}, we take the corresponding reference vector as known signal and extract the Approximately Sparse Factor signals incorporating corresponding 3 equalizer parameters ($\\lambda$) for the sparse-deconvolution method.

      "\\section{Activity Recognition}\nWe aim to detect single wrist-worn ACC sensor based hand gesture and postural activities and insert these into an HDBN graphical model in conjunction with ambient and object sensor values for complex activity recognition. We consider the recognition problem asan activity tupple of $\\langle gesture,posture,ambient,object \\rangle$. Though, Alam et. al. provides significant performance improvement for single wrist-worn ACC sensor aided 18-hand gesture based postural activity recognition in lab environment \\cite{alam17}, it faces some practical challenges in real-time smart environment with older adults due to the diversity of their postures. For example, some older adults use walker, double walking sticks or wheel chair for walking in which cases collecting 18 hand gestures and corresponding postural activities for training requires endless efforts and carefulness. To reduce the complexity of ground truth labeling and later state space explosion for graphical model (HDBN), we propose to use rotational normalization method that can merge some hand-gestures subject to directional differences and forms an 8-hand gesture model.

    "choices": [
      "A) The fuselage sides are initially laid out flat, but the bowing process introduces the necessary curvature during assembly.",
      "B) Aluminum or other deformable materials are used to accommodate the curvature, allowing for direct fabrication of the desired shape.",
      "C) The fuselage is constructed in a cylindrical shape, and the elliptical shape of the top longeron is a consequence of the cutting process.",
      "D) The construction process utilizes a combination of pre-bent panels and strategic sloped cuts to achieve the desired curvature while maintaining dimensional accuracy."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "documentation": [
      "Second, understand that the dimensions called for in the plans put a twist in the sides that tends to work the panel in two directions of curvature. This twist makes the panel \"undevelopable\" meaning that that shape cannot be unrolled into an equivalent flat shape. This is important when laying out the side and bottom panels onto flat plywood. To illustrate this, try forming a piece of paper around a soda can. The paper can be formed flat around the can either straight or at a diagonal to it's length. It has only one direction of curvature and is by definition \"developable\". Now try to form the same piece of paper around a baseball. It won't lie flat on the surface without some deformation (folding, wrinkling or tearing) of the paper. The ball has curvature in more that one direction and is a \"compounded\" shape. Paper (or plywood) can only be readily formed in developable shapes as opposed to aluminum or other metal which can accept in plane deformation. A developable surface is needed to lay out a curved surface when the materials used can't be deformed with any degree of in-plane strain. Initially, the fuselage sides are laid out flat with reference to the top longeron measured to a straight chalk line. The bowing problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. If the sides were not sloped (tumbled home) , the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. Since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is now conical. When a conical shape is cut with a plane (building surface) not perpendicular to it's axis, the shape formed is elliptical -- exactly what happens with the top longeron. When it's built flat, bent to form a cylindrical section, and sloped to form a conical section, it takes on an elliptical shape firewall to tailstock. This method borrows heavily from proven techniques used in the marine trades. It should be stressed at this point that although the layout procedure is not complicated, it is important to take your time.",
      "If the layout is not going well initially, start over! Better to erase layout errors now than to have them built it and cause surprises later. Layout to ensure a fair and true fuselage starts by drawing a reference line (baseline) on the building surface. Refer to figures 2 & 3 and use a wire guide to draw a very straight baseline. About 500 lbs. Of tension should be adequate. One could use a chalk line, but we're talking airplanes here, not house framing. The main layout difference is that the baseline isn't used as a reference for the top longeron. The baseline references the mid point of the firewall for the developed (and true dimensioned) side panel. Although the baseline will still be the reference, the top and bottom longerons will be laid separately. Layout differences don't end there. Each of the stations (vertical members) will be laid out with a calculated separation so that when the panels are formed into position, they land on the spacing called for in the plans. Another major difference is that the bottom & side panels are applied after forming the fuselage box section. This is mainly to obtain the ability to \"fair\" the side and bottom surfaces and insure a straight and true shape. Refer to figure 1 for the layout of the new developed side panel. The firewall (station a) is layed out perpendicular to the baseline. Longitudinal (station) measurements are given along the length of the baseline from the firewall. Vertical dimensions are given to reference the angle and breadths of the station at the baseline. Notice that the top longeron is bowed outward and that the stations are spaced slightly greater than called out in the plans. When the panels are formed into the box frame section ,they will work into the dimensions specified in the plans. Strike a centerline, longer than is needed on the building surface using a wire guide. Draw off the firewall line perpendicular to the centerline at one end. Using the distances listed in the balloons, mark them off on the centerline. Distances are measured to the nearest sixteenth of an inch."

Each pair of SEW ResNet and ResNet with the same depth are linked by a gray solid line. In almost all conditions, SEW ResNet outperforms ResNet by a large margin.

The normalized layer depth ranges from 0 (the first layer) to 1 (the last layer).Because the depths of models are not the same, we first discretize the normalized depth into 50 bins, and then apply the cubic spline interpolation to the scores of each model, yielding the smooth trajectories shown in the plot. The fine, semitransparent lines are the trajectories of each model. The thick lines are the average trajectories among each group.

      "However, deep SNNs have not been employed to model visual cortex due to the immaturity of training algorithms. Recently, a state-ofthe-art directly trained deep SNN , makes it possible to use deep SNNs as visual cortex models. Contributions. In this work, we conduct large-scale neural representation similarity experiments on SNNs and other high-performing deep neural networks to study the brain's visual processing mechanisms, with three datasets and three similarity metrics (Figure ). Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use deep SNNs to fit complex biological neural representations and explore the biological visual cortex. We summarize our main contributions in four points as follows. \u2022 We find that SNNs outperform their counterparts of CNNs with the same depth and almost the same architectures in almost all experiments. In addition, even with very different depths and architectures, SNNs can achieve top performance in most conditions. \u2022 By making a more direct comparison between macaques and mice for the first time, we reveal the differences in the visual pathways across the two species in terms of the homogeneity of visual regions and the increases of receptive field sizes across cortical visual pathways, which is consistent with previous physiological work. \u2022 The multi-branch structures in neural networks benefit neural representation similarity to mouse visual cortex, providing computational evidence that parallel information processing streams are widespread between cortical regions in the mouse visual system. \u2022 Comparing the results of two macaque neural datasets under different stimuli, we reveal that the macaque vision system may have functional specialization for processing human faces and other natural scenes. Altogether, as the first work to apply deep SNNs to fit neural representations, we shed light on visual processing mechanisms in both macaques and mice, demonstrating the potential of SNNs as a novel and powerful tool for research on the visual system."

Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 172\u201373 (1989). For normative evaluations of heightened stare decisis for statutory precedents, see generally Einer Elhauge, Statutory Default Rules: How to Interpret Unclear Legislation 211\u201323 (2008); and William N. Eskridge, Jr., Overruling Statutory Precedents, 76 Geo. L.J. 1361, 1364\u20131409 (1988). Justice Brandeis\u2019s logic demands that dormant commerce clause cases, where Congress is free to act, be granted the weightier stare decisis.54\u00d7 54. Scholars have noted the curious fact that Justice Brandeis included many dormant commerce clause cases as examples of overruled constitutional precedents. See, e.g., Earl M. Maltz, Commentary, Some Thoughts on the Death of Stare Decisis in Constitutional Law, 1980 Wis. L. Rev. 467, 468\u2013469, 469 n.11. One explanation for this is that Justice Brandeis sought the authority of Chief Justice Taney\u2019s dictum that the Court\u2019s \u201copinion upon the construction of the Constitution is always open to discussion\u201d \u2014 which referred to the dormant commerce clause. See Burnet, 285 U.S. at 408 n.3 (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (quoting The Passenger Cases, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 283, 470 (1849) (Taney, C.J., dissenting)). In Chief Justice Taney\u2019s time, it was thought that Congress could not override the Court\u2019s dormant commerce clause decisions, see Cooley v. Bd. of Wardens, 53 U.S. (12 How.) 299, 321 (1852), so the context of Chief Justice Taney\u2019s dictum does not conflict with Justice Brandeis\u2019s theory of stare decisis. The Court applied this reasoning in Quill, as Chief Justice Roberts underscored.55\u00d7 55. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2102 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). Yet the Wayfair majority refused to consider Congress\u2019s authority to legislate as a relevant factor for stare decisis.56\u00d7 56. Even Justice Kennedy\u2019s earlier opinion in Direct Marketing contemplated judicially overruling Quill, conspicuously neglecting a possible legislative solution.",

Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 405\u201310 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); Lee Epstein, William M. Landes & Adam Liptak, The Decision to Depart (or Not) from Constitutional Precedent: An Empirical Study of the Roberts Court, 90 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1115, 1116 (2015) (\u201c[Justice Brandeis\u2019s] dissenting opinion . . . now has the status of black letter law.\u201d). On the flip side, whenever a bad precedent can be corrected by Congress, stare decisis applies with \u201cspecial force. \u201d2\u00d7 2. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 172\u201373 (1989). The Court, following Justice Brandeis, usually articulates the rule as distinguishing between \u201cconstitutional\u201d and \u201cstatutory\u201d precedents. See, e.g., id. But the distinction is occasionally said to be between \u201cconstitutional\u201d and \u201cnonconstitutional cases.\u201d See, e.g., Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 543 (1962) (plurality opinion). Nomenclature aside, the Court has \u2014 until now \u2014 adhered to Justice Brandeis\u2019s key insight that the important factor is whether or not the mistake may be legislatively corrected. Last Term, in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.,3\u00d7 3. 138 S. Ct. 2080 (2018). the Court tinkered with this thinking in overruling an outdated dormant commerce clause precedent. Dormant commerce clause decisions technically produce constitutional holdings, but Congress may override them at will.4\u00d7 4. See Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U.S. 408, 421\u201327 (1946). Under the usual logic of stare decisis, it should take special force to dislodge such precedents.

      "As shown below, it does not introduce any qualitatively new features. On the other hand, it decreases the second stage Kondo temperature, which is already small, therefore,\nquantitative estimation of this decrease may be important for potential experimental approaches. To analyze the effects of $\\GS{1}\\neq\\GS{2}$, we introduce the asymmetry parameter $x$ and extend\nthe definition of $\\GS{}$,\n\\beq\nx = \\frac{\\GS{1}-\\GS{2}}{\\GS{1}+\\GS{2}}, \\quad \\GS{} = \\frac{\\GS{1}+\\GS{2}}{2}. \\label{xGS}\n \\end{equation} \nNote, that even for a fixed $\\GS{}$, the actual CAR coupling $\\GS{\\rm X}=\\GS{}\\sqrt{1-x^2}$ decreases\nwith increasing $|x|$, which is a main mechanism leading to a decrease of $T^*$ outside the $x=0$ point\nvisible in \\figs{x}(a) and (b). To illustrate this, the curves corresponding to \\emph{both} exchange\nmechanisms were calculated using $x$-dependent $t=\\GS{\\rm X}$ instead of $t=\\xi/\\sqrt{2}$. \nTherefore, $\\xi$ was generalized for $x\\neq 0$ by setting $\\xi=\\sqrt{t^2(1-x^2)^{-1}+\\GS{}^2}$.\nClearly, in \\fig{x}(b) the curves for different exchange mechanisms are very similar and differ mainly \nby a constant factor, resulting from different influence of $U'$; see \\Sec{scales}. The magnitude of $T^*$ changes is quite large, exceeding an order of magnitude for $x=\\pm 0.5$ \nand $\\xi=U/20$. Moreover, $T^* \\to 0$ for $x\\to\\pm 1$. Consequently, for strongly asymmetric\ndevices one cannot hope to observe the second stage of Kondo screening. A careful observer can note that the $T^*(x)$ dependency is not symmetrical; note for example different \n$T^*$ for $x=\\pm 0.5$ in \\fig{x}(a). This is caused by the dependence of the first stage Kondo temperature\n$T_K$ on $\\GS{1}$ \\cite{part1,DomanskiIW},\n\\beq\n\\widetilde{T}_K(\\GS{1}) = T_K \\cdot \\exp\\!\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{\\GS{1}^2}{\\Gamma U}\\right). \\end{equation} \nHere, $T_K$ is, as earlier, defined in the absence of SC, while $\\widetilde{T}_K$ is a function \nof $\\GS{1}$, such that $G(\\widetilde{T}_K) = G_{\\rm max}(\\GS{1})/2$ in the absence of QD2.",
      "This does not have to be the case in real setups, yet relaxing this assumption does not \nintroduce qualitative changes. Nevertheless, the model cannot be extended to inter-dot \ndistances much larger than the coherence length, where $\\GS{\\rm X}\\to 0$.\n\nTo quantitatively analyze the consequences of less effective Andreev coupling we define the \nCAR efficiency as $\\mathcal{C} \\equiv \\GS{\\rm X} / \\sqrt{\\GS{1}\\GS{2}}$ and analyze $\\mathcal{C} < 1$\nin the wide range of $\\GS{1}=\\GS{2}=\\GS{}$ and other parameters corresponding to \\fig{3}. The results are presented in \\fig{C}. Clearly, decreasing $\\mathcal{C}$ from $\\mathcal{C}=1$ causes diminishing of $\\GS{\\rm X}$, and consequently of CAR \nexchange. For a change as small as $\\mathcal{C}=0.9$, the consequences reduce to some shift of the \nconventional Kondo regime, compare \\fig{C}(a) with \\fig{3}. Stronger suppression of CAR may, \nhowever, increase the SC coupling necessary to observe the second stage of Kondo screening caused\nby CAR outside the experimentally achievable range, see \\fig{C}(b). Moreover, the reduced $T^*$\nleads to narrowing of the related local spectral density dip, while the\nincreased critical $\\GS{}$ necessary for the observation of the second stage of screening leads to the\nshallowing of the dip. This is visible especially in the inset in \\fig{C}(b). \\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{sec:conclusions}\n\nThe CAR exchange mechanism is present in any system comprising at least\ntwo QDs or magnetic impurities coupled to the same superconducting contact\nin a way allowing for crossed Andreev reflections. In the considered setup, comprised of two quantum dots in a T-shaped geometry \nwith respect to normal leads and proximized by superconductor,\nit leads to the two-stage Kondo\nscreening even in the absence of other exchange mechanisms. This CAR induced exchange screening is characterized by a residual \nlow-temperature conductance at particle-hole symmetric case. We have also shown that the competition between CAR exchange and RKKY\ninteraction may result in completely different Kondo screening scenarios."

      "According to the mixed source software business model approach, services can be: open source (open core- open extension), open core (open core- closed extension), open extensions (closed core- open extension) and proprietary (closed core- closed extension). Although this model was offered specifically suiting the software industry, we argue that similar approach can be useful in other ICT contexts to scale up value offering by adjusting cooperation and industrial partnering model. Figure 2 Mixed source business model approach [Adapted form 40]. Depending on individual organization\u2019s choice of mixed source options, it should eventually translate the value creation and value capture logic of the firm. Casadesus-Masanell & Llanes  argues that purely proprietary models results in higher captured value for organizations but lessens the scope of value creation for users. In contrast, purely open source models can deliver the maximum value to customers but reduce captured value. The key for organizations is to locate the best mix of openness-closeness for an optimum level of value capture and creation. From the business model elements collection, the mixed source approach explain key partners, key activities, key resources and technologies used. From a strategic perspective, this approach to business modeling helps an organization to find a way to scale up or down its business activities. This study concerns business possibilities of IoT and mobile device management in the context of futures digital hospital. Since future is elusive and the speed of technology advancements has been rapid during recent decades, we consider the most suitable method for conducting this research to be through qualitative approach. Qualitative methods helps with flexibility and sensitivity to the context that is less explored, and it can facilitate understanding of how things work in a particularly complex setting . We adopt a single qualitative case study approach for this research to explain underlying business potential of a scantly explored industrial context within the existing literature .",
      "And, in other cases, they are selling the service through MNO\u2019s bundled with connectivity and/or infrastructure. While as network infrastructure-driven security, a \u2018mobile network operator/carrier\u2019 or a \u2018network infrastructure vendor\u2019 can build own IoT-MDM system to offer their clients as well. And, finally, a location-specific micro operator can offer location-driven security. Micro operators offer mobile connectivity combined with specific, local services. The operation of a micro operator is spatially confined to either its premises or to a defined area of operation. As a part of the location-specific services, these micro operators can also offer IoT-MDM services for the users through outsourcing. Further, we attempt to connect the aforementioned classification and examples of different players offering IoT-MDM services with the mixed source business model approach. Table 2 summarizes our understanding on how each kind of cybersecurity provider can open and mix the core value creation logic for end users. As mentioned previously, the mixed-source business model options are: open source (open core, open extensions), open core (open core, closed extensions), open extensions (closed core, open extensions), and proprietary (closed core, closed extensions). In relation to these mixed-source options, we analyze the plausible options for each of the four distinct cybersecurity providers in the context of this study. Secure device manufacturer/provider Secure devices Proprietary (own device, own IoT-MDM platform), Open extensions (own device, outsourced IoT-MDM service). From a secure device manufacturer perspective, device business can be considered as the core operation whereas IoT-MDM services would be extended solution. A secure device manufacturer/provider can have either a proprietary model or an open extensions model. In the proprietary model, the secure device manufacturer will offer their own devices alongwith their own IoT-MDM system/service. This is a viable case in a sense that customers who are purchasing the fleet of secure devices might prefer the IoT-MDM service from the same vendor, which is ideally less risk prone."

The word you're looking for is Haswell, as far as I know. If tablets move into the $100-200 range, is there going to be room for Haswell?So long as there is a higher-end tablet market, then Haswell will be able to shine, but it's going to be a much more powerful and costly part than the sort of ARM based hardware that often runs tablets. If we see a race to the bottom where price is the dominant motivator behind purchases, then a high performance SoC will struggle to make its mark. melgross wrote:paul5ra wrote:As someone who has worked in the semiconductor industry for longer than contemporary fanboys have existed, I'm getting a bit fed-up seeing many of these articles which rewrite history with analyses distorted by the lens of the contemporary Apple or Samsung fanboy.",

My point is that the hard electrical engineering, mathematics, DSP, semiconductor physics/chemistry, RF engineering, analogue design,etc. that make modern telecommunications possible has very little to do with the fashion companies who consumers (and unfortunately much of the tech media) associate with it and give the credit (though in this respect Samsung does deserve a bit more credit for their work on NAND flash and displays). The industry simply would not exist TODAY without the overwhelming horizontal integration that already dominates. Yes the efforts of these companies getting cellular communications standardized were immense. And the technology matured. And then they didn't do much with it. It took some youngin's to look at the problem fresh and add the UI that make today's smartphones work. As we have all seen, the moment your technology has matured is the moment you are screwed because someone else now has the opportunity to look at it as a black box and make something new."

      "Na\u00efve realism is known as direct as against indirect or representative realism when its arguments are developed to counter the latter position, also known as epistemological dualism;[2] that our conscious experience is not of the real world but of an internal representation of the world. There is nothing of illusion in direct realism. There is only the foolish rhetoric implying that \"direct\" in \"direct realism\" means absorbing the actual object rather than data from those objects. The data IS from actual objects and does provide awareness of actual objects obeying the laws of physics. The implication that anyone is confusing the awareness of an object with the object itself is just ridiculous. Instead you can say that the process of perception is what makes illusions possible. Because we are interpreting data, then it is entirely possible for similar data to suggest something other than what is the case, such as the impression of water from a mirage -- at least until we learn the distinctions. When you consider the philosophical alternative, plastering the word \"illusion\" on direct realism implies that idealism is the reality beneath it. And that is an implication I would refute most heatedly. As for indirect realism, as I explained above, I think it is carrying things too far to say that we are experiencing the model instead of reality. Instead I would limits the validity only to the idea that we use a model in the process of perception. In that sense you could say my position is in-between that of direct realism and indirect realism.

Of course, \"seeing\" means no such thing. \"Seeing\" means gathering data to construct a mental model of an external reality. We don't, in fact, \"see\" this inner model at all. This \"model\" is a product of speculation and abstraction in meta-conscious process of self-reflection. Our inner viewport is thus one of looking out at the outer reality and not one of looking at the model. We do see across a room -- USING a mental model. We do not see the mental model except by speculative imagination. The most we can say is that by using such a process of mental modeling in order to see, there can be deviations due to a variety of neurological and mental processes being involved, including the role of beliefs in our interpretations. Thus our perceptions cannot be fully separated from our beliefs and our access to the world is fundamentally subjective. The objective can only be fully realized by a process of abstraction through communication with others.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "documentation": [
      "Based on the estimated parameters, we predict the future speed and longitudinal displacement as follows: Here, H a corresponds to the acceleration horizon while vk i (j) and \u015dk i (j) respectively represent the predicted speed and longitudinal displacement for vehicle i, j time steps into the future starting from the current time instant k. Remark 2: Due to the modular nature of the proposed framework, the behavior planning module detailed in Section III-B can work with advanced maneuver-based (e.g.\nMarkov Chain ) and interaction-based (e.g. Social Generative Adversarial Networks ) trajectory prediction modules, allowing for interactive maneuvering behaviors. Speed and Lane Advisory System\n\nThe goal of our behavior planning module, Speed and Lane Advisory System or in short, SLAS, is to determine a sequence of speed and lane change commands that would enable the ego vehicle to maximize its speed, thus minimizing the travel time, while accounting for driver comfort and abiding by its dynamical, actuator, and safety limits. The output of this module is a relatively smooth speed and lane change profile which is then passed on to a motion planner. It is necessary to incorporate the dynamical and actuator limits in the behavioral planning module so as not to provide the motion planner with goals that are not reachable, and jeopardize the safety of the overall system as a result. In the subsequent discussion, we provide a formulation of the optimization problem for SLAS; highlight the modifications necessary to improve the computational complexity; and, present safety and feasibility analysis. 1) Optimization Problem with Integer Constraints: SLAS is posed as an optimization problem, with the objective to maximize speed while minimizing frequent lane changes and abrupt changes in speed. The output of SLAS, at time instant k, is the control input u 0 (k + 1), as defined in . The optimization problem is formulated as follows: Objective Function: In the formulation above, the optimization variables are the ego vehicle's speed (v k (j)) and target lane (L k (j)), j step into the future, starting from time instant k.\nHere, H corresponds to the planning horizon.",
      "The state (x 0 (k)) and control input (u 0 (k)) to the system at time instant k are defined as: where V m denotes the maximum speed of the ego vehicle. Observation Model\n\nFor practical considerations, we restrict the ego vehicle's visibility range to the sensory perception limit, denoted by R v . Then, the set of vehicles in ego vehicle's visibility range at time instant k, represented by O(k), is defined as: where s i (k) corresponds to the longitudinal displacement of the observed vehicle. Remark 1: For the multi-lane highway driving scenario, occlusion does not play a prominent role so we do not account for it in the existing formulation. However, the proposed framework can easily accommodate occlusion and measurement uncertainties since the receding horizon approach bases its decision on the most up-to-date information available at any given time, as demonstrated in . In this section, we describe the prediction model to generate the predicted future trajectories of observed vehicles and present a discussion on the proposed receding horizon optimization-based behavioral planning module. Trajectory Prediction\n\nReliable behavior and trajectory prediction of other traffic participants is crucial for safe maneuvering of autonomous vehicles. The algorithm proposed in Section III-B is able to incorporate any generic prediction module available in the literature as long as it can provide a deterministic predicted future trajectory for a given vehicle. In this work, we formulate a low-complexity prediction model that highlights the flexibility and efficiency of our proposed approach. For an observed vehicle i \u2208 O(k), the future speed profile is predicted using a piece-wise linear function while the lane profile is assumed to stay constant for the duration of the prediction horizon. At a given time step k, the estimated acceleration (\u0101 k i ) and the estimated speed (v k i ) parameters are obtained through linear regression with mean-squared error on the past o k i > 1 speed observations."

      "Each of those manufacturers knew that smartphones would eventually be awesome, but none of them had the UI and software design to make a truly breakout product. Imagine if Motorola would have been smart enough to buy the Android guys instead of Google. Instead, Google bought a bunch of patents on that cellular black box to try to defend it's platform. And when you think about it, which consumes more man years of engineering effort per year at this point.... iterating that cellular black box or developing the OS, services and apps that power today's smartphones?\nIntel had better decide that they are competing in this space \"for real\", or they are screwed. They've already let the Atom languish for five years, during which ARM has completely caught up in performance. Just like Tim Cook said, if you don't cannibalize your own markets someone else will do it for you. Whether Intel will embrace that concept in time remains to be seen. Personally, I hope they don't; if Intel transforms into a chipless Fab company (like TSMC) everyone benefits. I still think Samsung has the advantage long term because they have both the SOC and the memory products. As mentioned in the article, TSV's (Through Silicon Via's) are going to be quite a disruption. Today, people normally stack an LPDDR2 package on top of their SOC package (POP or Package On Package). Within the LPDDR2 package, you could have a stack of DRAM die typically with wire bonding connecting the die within the package. Once you more to TSV's, you can have a LOT more connections between the SOC and its DRAM's. While this is being standardized through JEDEC (http://www.jedec.org/category/technolog ... a/3d-ics-0), Samsung has all the pieces in house to do whatever they want. You could see a 512 bit or higher bus from the SOC to the memory. The trick is that the memory and the SOC need to line up with each other when you stack them. This gives Samsung an inherent advantage. This isn't just going to impact mobile either. Take a look at that JEDEC link.",
      "This will increase yields dramatically. Of course Samsung and TSMC will build ARM out, but it definitely puts quite a bit of pressure on all other manufacturers. As the article mentions Intel and Samsung are the only ones who control production top to bottom, and Samsung must share some of the benefits with ARM. As someone who has worked in the semiconductor industry for longer than contemporary fanboys have existed, I'm getting a bit fed-up seeing many of these articles which rewrite history with analyses distorted by the lens of the contemporary Apple or Samsung fanboy. The mobile industry moved to horizontal integration a long time ago. Better indicators than these odd contemporary obsessions with the relatively non-innovative Samsung and Apple where when Motorola spun out its semiconductor division as Freescale, Nokia stopped making it's own custom designs with TI and ST, and Ericsson spun out it's Ericsson Mobile Platforms division and formed ST-Ericsson with ST.The true innovation in the mobile market was done a decade or more ago mainly by Moto/Nokia/Ericsson/TI/Qualcomm, and Samsung and Apple had little to do with it. Under the hood most stuff has been on a simple linear evolutionary path by the SoC providers since then. The phone manufacturers have then mainly been simply sticking these off-the-shelf SoCs (and their included low-level software stacks) in a box, a job made all the easier with the SoC manufacturer collaboration providing the bulk of the work for the AOSP.

      "They were two of the guys at the end of the DC-8,9, and 10 assembly lines responsible for correcting some of the nits and picks in various systems before delivery to the customer. They both wanted to build a fast, inexpensive airplane which was also economical to maintain. Several designs were considered, and plans were bought first for the Jeanie's Teenie and then the Taylor Monoplane. The Monoplane was more to their liking, but would require some modification to fit their needs. A cooperative redesign effort ensued, with virtually no dimensions left untouched. Only the basic fuselage structure, airfoil, and powerplant were retained. The tail shape was Stu's, and came directly from the big DC-8s parked on the ramp outside his office window. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport. Ken was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident. Ken's wife Jeanette became owner of RR overnight, and stepped up to keep the plans and parts coming. Much of the engineering needs are handled by Bill Marcy of Denver, who's been helping out since early '79. To date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5 KR2Ss now in the air. Much of the development work done on KR's is now done by the builders themselves. KR builders tend to be innovative, which leads to some interesting modifications. Some of the mods that work eventually creep into the plans. The KR2S is a case in point. Many builders who'd heard of the pitch sensitivity and tight cabin of the KR2 began to build an enlarged version, with the length determined by the most commonly available longeron material. The result is a KR2 that is stretched 2\" between firewall and main spar, and 14\" behind the main spar. Higher gross weights dictated more wing area, with the new standard becoming the Diehl wing skin. Those who plan to carry passengers commonly stretch the cabin width a few inches, although 1.5 inches is the limit if you still want to use RR's premolded parts.",
      "Les's canopy is a Dragonfly, using a four linkage system to swing forward when opening. The canopy frame fits snugly into a recess in the foward deck, providing an excellent wind and water seal. The fiberglass work is exemplary. Seating is luxurious for one. The cowling is also a work of art, and uses NACA ducts for efficiency. Female molds were made for all the fiberglass parts on Les's plane, so he could proabably be persuaded to make more, if demand dictates. Les also machines a multitude of KR aluminum and steel parts which he now offers for sale. The firewall was reinforced with aluminum brackets and angles bolted between the longerons in anticipation of the 200 lb Subaru EA-81 engine installation. His 100 HP Asian version is outfitted with an American Holley 5200 caburetor and manifold. It uses a PSRU of Les's own design, featuring two spur gears with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio and a toothed belt. Other than tapping the crank for larger bolts to mount the redrive, no other engine modifications were required. Also, this is probably the only air conditioned KR2 on the planet. The prop is a 60/63 Hegy.\nOriginally built as a taildragger, the fixed gear is made from 4130 steel tubing. Custom cast 6.00x6 aluminum wheels and steel rotors are mated with 6\" Cleveland calipers for braking. An early taxi test accident damaged the main gear, and prompted Les to change to tricycle gear. Again, he designed his own fiberglass main gear, and uses a Diehl nose wheel fork with a 4130 strut and 6\" wheel up front. Early tests revealed cooling problems, which prompted a radiator move from the firewall to a lower cowling location. The first flight was almost a disaster, as test pilot Randy Smith lost power right after takeoff. He managed a 180 with a safe downwind landing with only minor nosewheel pant damage. The culprit proved to be a spark plug with too much reach, which was quickly remedied. Subsequent flights have shown water temp to be about 210 degrees, oil temp is 220-230, and airspeed is about 180 mph."

      "We extend these findings in a mechanistic model which uses a biologically plausible learning mechanism (synaptic plasticity). We show how a simple evolutionary algorithm can optimize the different parameters of a simple reward-modulated plasticity rule for solving simple prediction and decision tasks. Reward-modulated plasticity has been extensively studied as a plausible mechanism for credit assignment in the brain ; ; and has found several applications in artificial intelligence and robotics tasks ; . Here, we demonstrate how such rules can be very well-tuned to take into account different environmental parameters and produce optimal behavior in simple systems. Additionally, we demonstrate how the co-evolution of plasticity and static functional connectivity in different subnetworks fundamentally changes the evolutionary pressures on the resulting plasticity rules, allowing for greater diversity in the form of the learning rule and the resulting learned connectivity. Several studies have demonstrated how, in biological networks, synaptic plasticity heavily interacts with and is driven by network topology . Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that biological plasticity mechanisms are highly redundant in the sense that any observed neural connectivity or recorded activity can be achieved with a variety of distinct, unrelated learning rules . This observed redundancy of learning rules in biological settings complements our results and suggests that the function of plasticity rules cannot be studied independently of the connectivity and topology of the networks they are acting on. The optimization of functional plasticity in neural networks is a promising research direction both as a means to understand biological learning processes and as a tool for building more autonomous artificial systems. Our results suggest that reward-modulated plasticity is highly adaptable to different environments and can be incorporated into larger systems that solve complex tasks. This work studies a simplified toy model of neural network learning in stochastic environments.",
      "abstract\n\nThe evolutionary balance between innate and learned behaviors is highly intricate, and different organisms have found different solutions to this problem. We hypothesize that the emergence and exact form of learning behaviors is naturally connected with the statistics of environmental fluctuations and tasks an organism needs to solve. Here, we study how different aspects of simulated environments shape an evolved synaptic plasticity rule in static and moving artificial agents. We demonstrate that environmental fluctuation and uncertainty control the reliance of artificial organisms on plasticity. Interestingly, the form of the emerging plasticity rule is additionally determined by the details of the task the artificial organisms are aiming to solve. Moreover, we show that coevolution between static connectivity and interacting plasticity mechanisms in distinct sub-networks changes the function and form of the emerging plasticity rules in embodied agents performing a foraging task. One of the defining features of living organisms is their ability to adapt to their environment and incorporate new information to modify their behavior. It is unclear how the ability to learn first evolved , but its utility appears evident. Natural environments are too complex for all the necessary information to be hardcoded genetically and more importantly, they keep changing during an organism's lifetime in ways that cannot be anticipated ; . The link between learning and environmental uncertainty and fluctuation has been extensively demonstrated in both natural ; , and artificial environments . Nevertheless, the ability to learn does not come without costs. For the capacity to learn to be beneficial in evolutionary terms, a costly nurturing period is often required, a phenomenon observed in both biological , and artificial organisms . Additionally, it has been shown that in some complex environments, hardcoded behaviors may be superior to learned ones given limits in the agent's lifetime and envi-ronmental uncertainty ; ; ."

      "D) While both compositional and observation-grounded methods exhibit comparable performance in the Pascal VOC game, compositional methods demonstrate a clear advantage in the blind traffic junction scenario due to their ability to adapt to changing environments."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "documentation": [
      "Thus, we should seek to make the complexity loss more convex. Our compositional communication complexity loss does not converge before task performance convergence. While the complexity loss tends to spike in the exploratory phase, the normalized value is very small. Interestingly, the method eventually converges as the complexity loss converges below a normal- ized 0.3. Additionally, the contrastive loss tends to decrease monotonically and converges after the task performance converges, showing a very smooth decrease. The contrastive f \u2212 loss decreases during training, which may account for success spikes prior to convergence. The method is able to converge after only a moderate decrease in the f + loss. This implies empirical evidence that the contrastive loss is an optimal critic for messaging. See figure 3.\n\nHeterogeneous Alignment Through Communication\n\nIn order to test the heterogeneous alignment ability of our methodology to learn higher-order concepts from highdimensional data, we analyze the performance on the Pascal VOC game. We compare our methodology against ae-comm to show that concepts should consist of independent information directly from task signal rather than compression to reconstruct inputs. That is, we show an empirical result on pixel data to verify the premise of the information bottleneck. Our methodology significantly outperforms the observation-grounded ae-comm baseline, as demonstrated by figure 4. The ae-comm methodology, despite using autoencoders to learn observation-grounded communication, performs only slightly better than no-comm. On the other hand, our methodology is able to outperform both baselines significantly. It is important to note that based on figure 4, our methodology is able to guess more than two of the four labels correctly across the two agents involved, while the baseline methodologies struggle to guess exactly two of thew four labels consistently. This can be attributed to our framework being able to learn compositional concepts that are much more easily discriminated due to mutual independence.",
      "In table 1, the size of the messages is automatically compressed to the smallest size to represent the information. Despite a trivially small amount of mutual information between tokens, our compositional method is able to reduce the message size in bits by 2.3x using our derived regularization, for a total of an 8x reduction in message size over non-compositional methods such as ae-comm. Since the base unit for the token is a 32-bit float, we note that each token in the message may be further compressed. We observe that each token uses three significant digits, which may further compress tokens to 10 bits each for a total message length of 20 bits. Communication Utility Results\n\nDue to coordination in MARL, grounding communication in referential features is not enough. Finding the communication utility requires grounding messages in ordinal information. Overall, figure shows that our compositional, contrastive method outperforms all methods focused on solely input-oriented communication grounding. In the blind traffic junction, our method yields a higher average task success rate and is able to achieve it with a lower sample complexity. Training with the contrastive update tends to spike to high success but not converge, often many episodes before convergence, which leaves area for training improvement. That is, the contrastive update begins to find aligned latent spaces early in training, but it cannot adapt the methodology quickly enough to converge. The exploratory randomness of most of the early online data prevents exploitation of the high utility f + examples. This leaves further room for improvement for an adaptive contrastive loss term. Regularization loss convergence After convergence to high task performance, the autoencoder loss increases in order to represent the coordination information. This follows directly from the information bottleneck, where there exists a tradeoff between utility and complexity. However, communication, especially referential communication, should have an overlap between utility and complexity."

      "Note that equation (\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) also holds true in Newtonian gravity. So in a way, this version of Einstein's equation can be seen as a second-order extension of the usual Einstein equivalence principle: Ordinarily, the equivalence principle is a statement about physics in the absence of tidal forces. Equation (\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) adds to this that the lowest-order correction for tidal forces in a freely falling reference frame is that specified by Newtonian gravity. This makes sense, since by going into a free-fall frame, and restricting our attention to a small spacetime region, we have automatically created a weak-gravity situation. In such a situation, tidal corrections are approximately the same as those described by Newton. This argument can serve as a heuristic justification of (\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}). In 2017, Kassner made use of the Baez-Bunn form of Einstein's vacuum equation to derive the Schwarzschild solution, starting from what we have encountered as the static form of the metric (\\ref{StaticForm}).\\cite{Kassner2017} We follow the same general recipe, but using the infalling coordinates introduced in section \\ref{Sec:InfallingObservers}, which makes our derivation even simpler. Consider five test particles in a small region of space. Let the motion of each be the same as for the local representative from our coordinate-defining family of infalling observers. We take the central particle $C$ to be at radial coordinate value $r=R$ at the time of the snapshot shown in Fig.~\\ref{TestParticlesOutside}. The other four are offset relative to the central particle: As described in the local inertial system that is co-moving with the central particle, one of the particles is shifted by $\\Delta l$ upwards in the radial direction, another downward, while two of the particles are offset orthogonally by the same distance. \\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\linewidth]{01-free-fall-particles.pdf}\n\\caption{Five test particles in our spherically-symmetric spacetime}\n\\label{TestParticlesOutside}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\nThe $\\Delta l$ is meant to be infinitesimally small, so while Fig.~\\ref{TestParticlesOutside} is of course showing a rather large $\\Delta l$ so as to display the geometry of the situation more clearly, we will in the following only keep terms linear in $\\Delta l$. \n\nConsider a generic particle, which moves as if it were part of our coordinate-defining family of infalling observers, and which at the time $T_0$ is at $r=r_0$. By a Taylor expansion, that particle's subsequent movement is given by\n\\begin{equation}\nr(T)",
      "\\section{$\\beta(r)$ from tidal deformations}\n\\label{TidalSection}\n\nIn the previous section, we had exploited symmetries and Einstein's equivalence principle. In order to determine $\\beta(r)$, we need to bring in additional information, namely the Einstein equations, which link the matter content with the geometry of spacetime. For our solution, we only aim to describe the spacetime metric outside whatever spherically-symmetric matter distribution resides in (or around) the center of our spherical symmetry. That amounts to applying the {\\em vacuum Einstein equations}. More specifically, we use a particularly simple and intuitive form of the vacuum Einstein equations, which can be found in a seminal article by Baez and Bunn:\\cite{BaezBunn2005} Consider a locally flat free-fall system around a specific event $\\cal E$, with a time coordinate $\\tau$, local proper time, where the event we are studying corresponds to $\\tau=0$. In that system, describe a small sphere of freely floating test particles, which we shall call a {\\em test ball}. The particles need to be at rest relative to each other at $\\tau=0$. Let the volume of the test ball be $V(\\tau)$. Then the vacuum version of Einstein's equations states that\n\\begin{equation}\n\\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 V}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2}\\right|_{\\tau=0} = 0.\n\\label{EinsteinVacuum}\n\\end{equation}\nIn words: If there is no matter or energy inside, the volume of such a test ball remains constant in the first order (those were our initial conditions) and the second order (by eq.~[\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}]). If you are familiar with Wheeler's brief summary of Einstein's equations, ``spacetime grips mass, telling it how to move'' and ``mass grips spacetime, telling it how to curve'',\\cite{Wheeler1990} you will immediately recognise that this is a specific way for the structure of spacetime telling the test ball particles how to move. The calculation later in this section provides the second part: It will amount to using (\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) to determine the structure of spacetime, namely the still missing function $\\beta(r)$, and that is the way for mass, in this case: for the absence of mass, to tell spacetime how to curve."

      "(Richard Horwood\u2019s Map of London, Westminster and the Borough of Southwark 1799, Motco Enterprises Limited, motco.com) One would think that the numbers of the sixteen original houses on the east side, Nos. 21 \u2013 36, would simply increase by ten with the addition of the ten new houses, but such was not the case; they increased by nine. How could that be? The only possible explanation is that No. 21 of the original houses was demolished to make way for the construction of the northernmost of the six new houses on the east side (No. 30). Evidence of No. 21\u2019s demolition appears in the lease granted to Charles Owen by William, 7th Baron Craven, in 1792, which describes No. 22 as: \u201cAll that messuage in Craven Street late in the occupation of Francis Deschamps undertaker \u2026 being the Southernmost house in the Old Buildings on the East Side of the said Street numbered with the No. 22.\u201d[13] The lease describes No. 22 as being the southernmost house in the old buildings on the east side of Craven Street. Clearly the house previously at No. 21 did not exist when the lease granted to Charles Owen was written in 1792 as it used to be the southernmost house. It is also worth noting that in 1790, The London Directory listed Jacob Life at No. 21 (original numbering). In 1791-2, it listed him at No. 6. With No. 21 vacated, it would allow for its demolition and the construction of the tenth new house. By utilizing lot No. 21 for the new construction, only nine additional lots were needed to build the ten houses, hence, Margaret Stevenson\u2019s former residence at 27 became 36 (27 + 9) in the renumbering and not 37. For nearly a century and a half after Franklin departed London for America in March of 1775 the scales were tipped heavily in favor of his residence having been No. 7 Craven Street. As early as 1807 in London; Being An Accurate History And Description Of The British Metropolis And Its Neighborhood, Volume 4, one would have read: \u201cIn Craven Street is a house, No. 7, remarkable for having been the residence of Dr. Benjamin Franklin.[14]",
      "Few of them were rated at more than a few shillings and many of them were unoccupied.\u201d[1] The landowner, William, 5th Baron Craven, desiring to increase the profitability of his assets, tore down the derelict structures on Spur Alley around 1730 and leased the newly established lots to builders. By 1735, twenty brick houses in the Georgian style had been built on the west side and sixteen on the east side of the way now called Craven Street.[2] Figure 2. Craven Street 1746. (John Rocque London, Westminster and Southwark, First Edition 1746, Motco Enterprises Limited, motco.com)\nLetters to Franklin during his residence with Mrs. Margaret Stevenson, his landlady on Craven Street, were addressed rather vaguely; \u201cCraven Street/Strand\u201d, \u201cMrs. Stevensons in Craven Street\u201d, or \u201cBenjamin Franklin Esqr.\u201d are but a few examples. Letters from Franklin referenced \u201cLondon,\u201d or sometimes \u201cCravenstreet,\u201d but never included a number. Despite the absence of numbered addresses in Franklin\u2019s correspondence, there was a sense of one\u2019s place in the neighborhood based on entries in the Westminster Rate Books (tax assessments). The Rate Books did not list house numbers during Franklin\u2019s time there, but they did list the residents of Craven Street in a particular order that became the default numbering system for the street. Number one was associated with the first resident listed under \u201cCraven Street\u201d in the Rate Books and was the northernmost house on the west side of the street. The numbers increased counter-clockwise down the west side and up the east side in accordance with the list of residents. In 1748, the first year of Margaret Stevenson\u2019s (Stevens in the Rate Books for that year) residence on Craven Street, she is listed as the twenty-seventh resident, the second house north of Court Street (later Craven Court, now Craven Passage) on the east side of the street.[3]\nIn 1766, Parliament passed the London Paving and Lighting Act (6 Geo. 3 c. 26), \u201cAn act for the better paving, cleansing, and enlightening, the city of London, and the liberties thereof; and for preventing obstructions and annoyances within the same; and for other purposes therein mentioned."

      "In this work, we propose a method to jointly detect GPS spoofing and jamming attacks in the V2X network. A coupled generalized dynamic Bayesian network (C-GDBN) is employed to learn the interaction between RF signals received by the RSU from multiple vehicles and their corresponding trajectories. This integration of vehicles' positional information with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications allows semantic learning while mapping RF signals with vehicles' trajectories and enables the RSU to jointly predict the RF signals it expects to receive from the vehicles from which it can anticipate the expected trajectories. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: \\textit{i)} A joint GPS spoofing and jamming detection method is proposed for the V2X scenario, which is based on learning a generative interactive model as the C-GDBN. Such a model encodes the cross-correlation between the RF signals transmitted by multiple vehicles and their trajectories, where their semantic meaning is coupled stochastically at a high abstraction level. \\textit{ii)} A cognitive RSU equipped with the acquired C-GDBN can predict and estimate vehicle positions based on real-time RF signals. This allows RSU to evaluate whether both RF signals and vehicles' trajectories are evolving according to the dynamic rules encoded in the C-GDBN and, consequently, to identify the cause (i.e., a jammer attacking the V2I or a spoofer attacking the satellite link) of the abnormal behaviour that occurred in the V2X environment. \\textit{iii)} Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately estimates the vehicles' trajectories from the predicted RF signals, effectively detect any abnormal behaviour and identify the type of abnormality occurring with high detection probabilities. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that studies the joint detection of jamming and spoofing in V2X systems. \\section{System model and problem formulation}\nThe system model depicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig_SystemModel}, includes a single cell vehicular network consisting of a road side unit (RSU) located at $\\mathrm{p}_{R}=[{x}_{R},{y}_{R}]$, a road side jammer (RSJ) located at $\\mathrm{p}_{J}=[{x}_{J},{y}_{J}]$, a road side spoofer (RSS) located at $\\mathrm{p}_{s}=[{x}_{s},{y}_{s}]$ and $N$ vehicles moving along multi-lane road in an urban area.",
      "This proves that RSU learned the correct dynamic rules of how RF signals and trajectories evolve when the jammer and spoofer are absent (i.e., under normal situations). Also, we can see that the RSU can notice a high deviation on both the RF signal and the corresponding trajectory due to a jamming interference from what it has learned so far by relying on the abnormality signals. In contrast, we can see that under spoofing attacks, RSU notice a deviation only on the trajectory and not on the RF signal since the spoofer has affected only the positions without manipulating the RF signal. In addition, it is obvious how the proposed method allows the RSU to identify the type of abnormality occurring and to explain the cause of the detected abnormality (i.e., understanding if it was because of a jammer attacking the V2I link or a spoofer attacking the satellite link). \\begin{figure}[t!] \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=6.5cm]{Results/trajectories_underJamming_andSpoofing}\n   \n    \\caption{Vehicle's trajectory under: normal situation, jamming and spoofing.}\n    \\label{fig_exNormal_Spoofed_JammedTrajectories}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n    \\begin{center}\n        \\begin{minipage}[b]{.92\\linewidth}\n        \\centering\n            \\includegraphics[height=2.6cm]{Results/abnSignal_onRF}\n        \\\\[-1.5mm]\n        {\\scriptsize (a)}\n        \\end{minipage}\n        \\begin{minipage}[b]{.92\\linewidth}\n            \\centering\n            \\includegraphics[height=2.6cm]{Results/abnSignal_onGPS}\n            \\\\[-1.5mm]\n            {\\scriptsize (b)}\n        \\end{minipage}\n        %\n        \\caption{Abnormality Signals related to the example shown in Fig.\\ref{fig_exNormal_Spoofed_JammedTrajectories}: (a) abnormality indicators related to the RF signal, (b) abnormality indicators related to the trajectory.}\n            \\label{fig_abnormalitySignals_JammerSpoofer}\n    \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t!] \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[height=3.2cm]{Results/Detection_Probability_RFfromGPS_versusPj}\n    \\caption{Detection probability ($\\mathrm{P_{d}}$) versus jammer's power ($\\mathrm{P_{J}}$) using different number of clusters $\\mathrm{M}_{2}$.}\n    \\label{fig_jammerDetectionProb}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t!]"

      "In the MARL setup, agents, as speakers and listeners, learn a set of tokens to communicate observations, intentions, coordination, or other experiences which help facilitate solving tasks . Agents learn to communicate effectively through a backpropagation signal from their task performance . This has been found useful for applications in human-agent teaming , multirobot navigation , and coordination in complex games such as StarCraft II . Communication quality has been shown to have a strong relationship with task performance , leading to a multitude of work attempting to increase the representational capacity by decreasing the convergence rates . Yet these methods still create degenerate communication protocols , which are uninterpretable due to joined concepts or null (lack of) information, which causes performance degradation. In this work, we investigate the challenges of learning a arXiv:2302.14276v1 LG] 28 Feb 2023 messaging lexicon to prepare emergent communication for social learning (EC4SL) scenarios. We study the following hypotheses: H1) EC4SL will learn faster through structured concepts in messages leading to higher-quality solutions, H2) EC4SL aligns the policies of expert heterogeneous agents, and H3) EC4SL enables social shadowing, where an agent learns a communication policy while only observing an expert agent's action policy. By learning a communication policy, the agent is encouraged to develop a more structured understanding of intent, leading to better coordination. The setting is very realistic among humans and many computer vision and RL frameworks may develop rich feature spaces for a specific solo task, but have not yet interacted with other agents, which may lead to failure without alignment. We enable a compositional emergent communication paradigm, which exhibits clustering and informativeness properties. We show theoretically and through empirical results that compositional language enables independence properties among tokens with respect to referential information.",
      "However, in most cases, emergent communication sends insufficiently compressed messages with little or null information, which also may not be understandable to a third-party listener. This paper proposes an unsupervised method based on the information bottleneck to capture both referential complexity and task-specific utility to adequately explore sparse social communication scenarios in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We show that our model is able to i) develop a natural-language-inspired lexicon of messages that is independently composed of a set of emergent concepts, which span the observations and intents with minimal bits, ii) develop communication to align the action policies of heterogeneous agents with dissimilar feature models, and iii) learn a communication policy from watching an expert's action policy, which we term 'social shadowing'. INTRODUCTION\n\nSocial learning agents analyze cues from direct observation of other agents (novice or expert) in the same environment to learn an action policy from others. However, observing expert actions may not be sufficient to coordinate with other agents. Rather, by learning to communicate, agents can better model the intent of other agents, leading to better coordination. In humans, explicit communication for coordination assumes a common communication substrate to convey abstract concepts and beliefs directly , which may not be available for new partners. To align complex beliefs, heterogeneous agents must learn a message policy that translates from one theory of mind to another to synchronize coordination. Especially when there is complex information to process and share, new agent partners need to learn to communicate to work with other agents. Emergent communication studies the creation of artificial language. Often phrased as a Lewis game, speakers and listeners learn a set of tokens to communicate complex observations . However, in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), agents suffer from partial observability and non-stationarity (due to unaligned value functions) , which aims to be solved with decentralized learning through communication."

      "Although blood supplies in the United States are very safe, particularly relative to the past and to other areas of the world, there remains an increased risk of exposure to such blood-borne infections as hepatitis. Additionally, the body is not able to get rid of the excess iron that accompanies each transfusion. An additional medication called desferoxamine is administered, usually five nights per week over a period of several hours, using an automatic pump that can be used during sleep or taken anywhere the person goes. This medication is able to bind to the excess iron, which can then be eliminated through urine. If desferoxamine is not used regularly or is unavailable, iron overload can develop and cause tissue damage and organ damage and failure. The heart, liver, and endocrine organs are particularly vulnerable. Desferoxamine itself may rarely produce allergic or toxic side effects, including hearing damage. Signs of desferoxamine toxicity are screened for and generally develop in individuals who overuse the medication when body iron levels are sufficiently low. Overall, however, transfusion and desferoxamine therapy have increased the life expectancy of individuals with the most severe types of beta thalassemia major to the 4th or 5th decade. This can be expected to improve with time and increased developments in treatment, as well as for those with more mild forms of the disease. New treatments offer additional options for some individuals with beta thalassemia major. There are various medications that target the production of red blood cells (i.e. erythropoeitin) or fetal hemoglobin (i.e. hydroxyurea and butyrate). Their effectiveness in ameliorating the severity of beta thalassemia is currently being investigated. Another promising new treatment is bone marrow transplantation, in which the bone marrow of an affected individual is replaced with the bone marrow of an unaffected donor. If successful, this treatment can provide a cure. However, there is an approximately 10-15% chance the procedure could be unsuccessful (i.e. the thalassemia returns); result in complications (i.e. graft-versus-host disease); or result in death.",
      "Although transfusion therapy prevents many of the complications of severe anemia, the body is unable to eliminate the excess iron contained in the transfused blood. Over time, the excess iron deposits in tissues and organs, resulting in damage and organ failure. Another medication must be administered to help the body eliminate the excess iron and prevent iron-over-load complications. Beta thalassemia intermedia describes the disease in individuals who have moderate anemia that only requires blood transfusions intermittently, if at all. Alpha thalassemia is the result of changes in the genes for the alpha globin component of hemoglobin. There are two main types of alpha thalassemia disease: hemoglobin H disease and alpha thalassemia major. The two diseases are quite different from beta thalassemia as well as from one another. Individuals with hemoglobin H disease can experience events of hemolytic anemia\u2014anemia caused by the rapid breakdown of the red blood cells. These events are thought to be triggered by various environmental causes, such as infection and/or exposure to certain chemicals. Hemoglobin H disease is in most cases milder than beta thalassemia. It does not generally require transfusion therapy. Alpha thalassemia major is a very serious disease that results in severe anemia that begins even before birth. Most affected babies do not survive to be born or die shortly after birth. The thalassemias are among the most common genetic diseases worldwide. Both alpha and beta thalassemia have been described in individuals of almost every ancestry, but the conditions are more common among certain ethnic groups. Unaffected carriers of all types of thalassemia traits do not experience health problems. In fact, the thalassemia trait is protective against malaria, a disease caused by blood-borne parasites transmitted through mosquito bites. According to a widely accepted theory, most genetic changes\u2014mutations\u2014that cause thalassemia occurred multiple generations ago. Coincidentally, these mutations increased the likelihood that carriers would survive malaria infection."

      "To optimize the use of human input and quickly infer the human's preference, Fig. : An autonomous robot navigates in a simulated classroom towards a goal location (pink circle). At the start of its mission, it receives direction indications (arrows) from a human that indicate which path it should take to get to the goal. In this scenario, the human wants the robot to go around the desks on the right side of the classroom. A robot that does not reason over path preferences (green) will take the shortest path to the goal regardless of the human's input. Our method (blue) infers the human's path preference from these indications and adapts to their recommendations. we propose an approach that leverages probabilistic representations of human preference and incorporates real-time feedback. Previous research by Bajcsy et al. considered an online adaptation problem in a manipulation task, where the person can apply forces to the robot to indicate their preferences. By allowing the robot to continue its task while taking into account a probabilistic representation of human preference, their approach does not require frequent inputs. Building on this idea, we adopt a similar approach to adapt to a human's preference in the context of a robot autonomously navigating through a known environment, such as a cluttered office space. Specifically, we focus on allowing the human to influence the robot's trajectory with respect to obstacles, by providing guidance on preferred routes or paths, while the robot continues to execute its task. Paths can be represented using homotopy classes . However, homotopies can pose computational challenges when used to encode and infer human preferences. When the robot maintains a belief over homotopy classes, the inference problem can become exponentially complex with the number of obstacles in the space. Additionally, when the goal is unknown, the number of variables increases with the number of candidate destinations. This complexity can render the decision-making problem intractable.",
      "We find that in these runs, accounting for path preference consistently improves performance compared with the goal-only baseline. Results also show that blending the user's input with the robot's policy (Path Preference + Blend) when the human provides information leads to improved performance. Belief entropy. Figure shows a challenging problem instance where the directions the human provides do not align directly with the shortest path to the goal. By ignoring the effects of preferences in the problem model (goal only), the robot quickly infers from observations that the upper left goal is less likely than others (P (g) drops). The strong decrease in entropy shows that the robot becomes overconfident in this prediction. Overconfidence in an incorrect goal will prevent the agent from finding the correct goal once the human's indications directly align with it, as it needs to correct for the wrong predictions, as shown in the path realization (fig.\n). In this realization, the goal-only method (green robot) fails to search the upper left area within the allotted time. By accounting for path preferences in its model, the blue robot's entropy over the goal distribution decreases more steadily, allowing for it to leverage the human's latest observations and reach the goal successfully. shows an over-confident prediction (shown by the strong reduction in belief entropy) that the correct goal is less likely, making it more difficult to reach the correct goal compared to a method that accounts for path preference. Computation time. In table II we provide the time required to solve the POMDP, and the time required to update the robot's belief as it receives new observations. We compute solutions on three maps: a simple 10 \u00d7 10 grid world with 8 polytopes (fig. ), a 10 \u00d7 10 grid world with 56 polytopes (fig. ), and a 20\u00d720 grid world with 73 polytopes (fig. ). The latter environment being larger, we increase the mission time and the depth of the search tree in POMCP from T max = 30 (Map 1 and Map 2) to T max = 60 (Map 3)."

      "So it is no longer true that national power and national security are increased when government has the sole right to gather intelligence and encipher communications. Now the strength of a country depends not only on its government, but also on its corporations. The old premises have fallen away in the new reality, but the old policy remains. It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage. Well, digital media -- computer-based communications -- are the printing press of the 21st century, and as the printing press transformed society, created the modern individual, gave rise to the basis of the democratic state and to the notion of individual rights, I suspect that we will see a similar, radical transformation of the very constitution of global society in the next century, facilitated by this enabling technology. I would be the last person to try to sketch out the details, or tell you what the issues are going to be, but I want to share with you some feelings about what is really going to matter, as we go about this -- and I'll start with something about myself. You see a guy wearing a suit; most of you know I have a lot of money -- I'm a successful businessman. God knows what images propagate around the media and settle in people's minds, but I've always seen myself, and felt myself to the core of my being, as an outsider, every bit as much as a self-proclaimed outsider, as Tom Jennings -- who spoke so eloquently about this at the Pioneer awards* yesterday -- was. *The Electronic Freedom Foundation presented its first awards at a related, adjacent reception which was not formally a part of the conference. I think we are all outsiders; we are all different, all unique. We're not the same. We share an underlying common humanity, but we should not be asked to subjugate ourselves to some form of mass society that causes us each to become indistinguishable from one another. I believe that computer- based communications technology is an enabling technology to liberate individuals and to free us from the oppressive influence of large institutions, whether those are public or private.",
      "Because the space of opportunity for people to engage in transactions with each other has been so enormously enlarged during the past decade, faith in marketplace democracies is on the rise worldwide; correspondingly faith in central management mechanisms is on the decline. This shift has brought with it a shift of the power of institutions. Government institutions tend to try to hold onto their power by regulatory coercion to enforce the old ways. This can produce big tensions and even promote breakage. Nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in the cryptographic area which we have just been talking about in the previous hour. This technology, cryptography, produces mechanisms for digital signatures, authentication, electronic money, certificates, and private communication -- all offering a way for standard business practices now based on paper to be shifted into the electronic media. The success of worldwide enterprises depends on this shift being completed rapidly and effectively. As more people realize this, the momentum for incorporating cryptographic technology into the information infrastructure is accelerating. In this country, the National Security Agency has long been given the authority to regulate cryptography. This authority was granted in another time when the success of the country depended upon the ability of its government to gather intelligence and communicate in secret. These premises made sense in a world where most of the power resided in governments, but the world is changing. Much economic power is now accumulating in large apolitical transnational corporations. These corporations place their own concerns and strategies ahead of those of governments of the countries in which they do business. Like governments, they are interested in gathering intelligence about competitors and in conducting business in private. Unlike governments, they want open access to the technologies of authentication, electronic money, digital signatures, and certificates that will allow them to conduct business transactions across the network."

      "Now most know that they can buy the game they want without committing to others they don't. One way to win them back is to lower the investment. BC will miss out on the mark up of the premium games, but at least they will have more people invest in a whole season. BC is indirectly doing this already with their discounts of the less desirable games. If the NFL is lowering prices on parking and concessions, BC should also explore it. Like the NFL we are getting more and more money from TV. Why not make the ingame experience more affordable. In-game experience This has been discussed ad nauseum, but needs to be looked at again. I don't think it is as simple as the NFL's push for wireless. We need the game day experience to be inviting from the moment the gates open to the moment the last fan is leaving. It is about the music, the ushers, the video boards, the halftime, the activities during commercial breaks. I don't want BC to turn into a barrage of nonsense, but we can do more. I don't go to many BC games. That's mostly because of my location. But I also like the watching the game in my home. The convenience, the visuals, and the costs all factor into my decision.

We like to blame the tailgating or Spaz or the schedule, but the reality is there are multiple factors. Just look at the attendance issues facing the most popular league in American sports -- the NFL. If they can't get butts in the seats, how can BC? The NFL has a few different solutions in play. Perhaps, BC can learn from them. Fewer Seats\nThe NFL is lowering the bar, so that blackout rules don't require sellouts. Blackouts are not an issue in college, but perhaps few seats will help demand and make Alumni seem full. I don't want to tear out seats, but maybe we can replace the bleachers with actual seats. That would take up more space, eliminate seats and improve the watching experience. The internet has added fluidity to the ticket market.

Tuesday, Nouri al-Maliki managed to put away the political stalemate thanks to a lot of Scotch -- tape to hold the deal together and booze to keep your eyes so crossed you don't question how someone can claim to have formed a Cabinet when they've left over ten positions to be filled at a later date. One group speaking out is women. Bushra Juhi and Qassmi Abdul-Zahra (AP) report, \"Iraq's female lawmakers are furious that only one member of the country's new Cabinet is a woman and are demanding better representation in a government that otherwise has been praised by the international community for bringing together the country's religious sects and political parties.\" As noted Tuesday, though represenation in Parliament is addressed in Iraq's Constitution, there is nothing to address women serving in the Cabinet. Aseel Kami (Reuters) notes one of the most damning aspects of Nouri's chosen men -- a man is heaing the Ministry of Women's Affairs.

Although Maliki appears to be bending over backward to accommodate rivals among Iraq's Shiite majority as well as minority Sunnis and Kurds in his administration in a spirit of reconciliation, he is unlikely to relinquish those ministries that dominate the security sector.\" DPA reports, \"Sheikh Abdel-Mahdi al-Karbalaei, a confident of influential Shiite spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, said that the new cabinet is 'below the standards' Iraqi citizens had hoped for and suggested it could prove to be weaker than the previous government.\" Ranj Alaaldin (Guardian) also spots clouds on the horizon:Lasting peace and stability depends on resolving outstanding disputes with the Kurds on oil, revenue-sharing, security and the disputed territories (Kirkuk in particular). The Kurds, rather than exploiting their kingmaker position to take a stronger proportion of ministries in Baghdad (they are taking just one major portfolio \u2013 the foreign ministry), are instead banking on guarantees from Maliki to implement their list of 19 demands that includes resolving the above disputes in their favour. They may have been naive, though. With their historical and federalist partners, the Islamic supreme council of Iraq in decline, the Kurds may be isolated in the new government \u2013 a government dominated by the nationalistic and centrist characteristics of the INM, the Sadrists and indeed State of Law. Maliki may, therefore, turn out to be unable to grant concessions even if he wanted to and could use Osama Nujayfi, the new ultra-nationalist speaker of parliament and Kurdish foe, to absorb the Kurdish criticism and insulate himself from any attacks."

      "Early life\nEnglish was born on 30 December 1961 at Lumsden Maternity Centre in Lumsden. He is the eleventh of twelve children of Mervyn English and Norah (n\u00e9e O'Brien) English. His parents purchased Rosedale, a mixed sheep and cropping farm in Dipton, Southland from Mervyn's uncle, Vincent English, a bachelor, in 1944. English was born in the maternity unit at Lumsden. English attended St Thomas's School in Winton, then boarded at St. Patrick's College in Upper Hutt, where he became head boy. He played in the first XV of the school's rugby team. English went on to study commerce at the University of Otago, where he was a resident at Selwyn College, and then completed an honours degree in English literature at Victoria University of Wellington. After finishing his studies, English returned to Dipton and farmed for a few years. From 1987 to 1989, he worked in Wellington as a policy analyst for the New Zealand Treasury, at a time when the free market policies favoured by Labour's finance minister Roger Douglas (known collectively as \"Rogernomics\") were being implemented. English joined the National Party in 1980, while at Victoria University. He served for a period as chairman of the Southland branch of the Young Nationals, and became a member of the Wallace electorate committee. After moving to Wellington, he served for periods on the Island Bay and Miramar electorate committees, respectively. Fourth National Government (1990\u20131999) At the 1990 general election, English stood as the National candidate in Wallace, replacing the retiring Derek Angus, and was elected with a large majority. He would hold this seat, renamed Clutha-Southland in 1996, until 2014. He and three other newly elected National MPs (Tony Ryall, Nick Smith, and Roger Sowry) were soon identified as rising stars in New Zealand politics, and at various points were dubbed the \"brat pack\", the \"gang of four\", and the \"young Turks\". In his first term in parliament, English chaired a select committee into social services. He was made a parliamentary under-secretary in 1993, serving under the Minister of Health.",
      "English had been a supporter of Bolger as leader, but Shipley reappointed him Minister of Health in her new cabinet. English was promoted to Minister of Finance in a reshuffle in January 1999, a position which was at the time subordinate to the Treasurer, Bill Birch. After a few months, the pair switched positions as part of Birch's transition to retirement, with English assuming the senior portfolio. In early interviews, he emphasised his wish to be seen as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue, and said that the initiatives of some of his predecessors (Roger Douglas's \"Rogernomics\" and Ruth Richardson's \"Ruthanasia\") had focused on \"fruitless, theoretical debates\" when \"people just want to see problems solved\". Opposition (1999\u20132008)\n\nAfter the National Party lost the 1999 election to Helen Clark's Labour Party, English continued on in the shadow cabinet as National's spokesperson for finance. He was elected deputy leader of the party in February 2001, following the resignation of Wyatt Creech, with Gerry Brownlee being his unsuccessful opponent. Leader of the Opposition\nIn October 2001, after months of speculation, Jenny Shipley resigned as leader of the National Party after being told she no longer had the support of the party caucus. English was elected as her replacement unopposed (with Roger Sowry as his deputy), and consequently became Leader of the Opposition. However, he did not openly organise against Shipley, and according to The Southland Times \"there was almost an element of 'aw, shucks, I'll do it then' about Mr English's ascension\". Aged 39 when he was elected, English became the second-youngest leader in the National Party's history, after Jim McLay (who was 38 when elected in 1984). He also became only the third Southlander to lead a major New Zealand political party, after Joseph Ward and Adam Hamilton. However, English failed to improve the party's performance. In the 2002 election, National suffered its worst electoral defeat ever, gaining barely more than twenty percent of the vote."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "The example presented in Fig. shows a molecule that was switched from 5para to 5OS and back to 5para. The switching is not directed, that is, we cannot choose which of the two species will be formed when changing the adsorption site, and we observed 5OS and 5para in approximately equal yields upon changing the adsorption site. The molecule in Fig. is adsorbed on top of a defect that stabilizes its adsorption geometry on bilayer NaCl. At defect-free adsorption sites on bilayer NaCl, that is, without a third layer NaCl island or atomic defects in the vicinity of the molecule, 5 could be stably imaged neither by AFM nor by STM at ionic resonances (Supplementary Fig. ). Without changing the adsorption site, the state of 5 (open-or closedshell) never changed, including the experiments on bilayer NaCl/Ag(111) and Cu(111), on which the charge state of 5 could be switched (Supplementary Figs. ). Also on these lower work function surfaces, both open-and closed-shell species were observed for 5 0 and both showed charge bistability between 5 0 (5OS or 5para) and 5 -1 (Supplementary Figs. ). The geometrical structure of 5 -1 probed by AFM, and its electronic structure probed by STM imaging at the NIR (corresponding to transitions between 5 -1 and the dianionic state 5 -2 ), are identical within the measurement accuracy for the charged species of both 5OS and 5para. When cycling the charge state of 5 between 5 0 and 5 -1 several times, we always observed the same state (5OS or 5para) when returning to 5 0 , provided the molecule did not move during the charging/discharging process. Based on our experimental observations we conclude that indeno[1,2-a]fluorene (5), the last unknown indenofluorene isomer, can be stabilized in and switched between an open-shell (5OS) and a closed-shell (5para) state on NaCl. For the former, both DFT and QD-NEVPT2 calculations predict a triplet electronic configuration. Therefore, 5 can be considered to exhibit the spin-crossover effect, involving magnetic switching between high-spin (5OS) and low-spin (5para) states, coupled with a reversible structural transformation.",
      "So far, the spin-crossover effect has mainly only been observed in transition-metal-based coordination compounds with a near-octahedral geometry . The observation that the switching between open-and closedshell states is related to changes in the adsorption site but is not achieved by charge-state cycling alone, indicates that the NaCl surface and local defects facilitate different electronic configurations of 5 depending on the adsorption site. Gas-phase QD-NEVPT2 calculations predict that 5OS is the ground state, and the closed-shell 5para and 5ortho states are 0.11 and 0.21 eV higher in energy. The experiments, showing bidirectional switching between 5OS and 5para, indicate that a change in the adsorption site can induce sufficient change in the geometry of 5 (leading to a corresponding change in the ground state electronic configuration) and thus induce switching. Switching between open-and closed-shell states in 5 does not require the breaking or formation of covalent bonds , but a change of adsorption site on NaCl where the molecule is physisorbed. Our results should have implications for single-molecule devices, capitalizing on the altered electronic and chemical properties of a system in \u03c0-diradical open-shell and closed-shell states such as frontier orbital and singlet-triplet gaps, and chemical reactivity. For possible future applications as a single-molecule switch, it might be possible to also switch between open-and closed-shell states by changing the local electric field, such as by using chargeable adsorbates .

      "Take away freedom and order will be overthrown -- witness the Soviet Union. Take away tradition, and modernization will be crushed -- witness Iran. The clearing must be respected and it must move. Just as Benjamin Cardozo of the U.S. Supreme Court said 65 years ago, the genius of the American system is its penchant for ordered liberty. When both halves of the equation work against each other and together in Hegelian terms, the clearing that they produce is, at any given time, a prevailing hypothesis, which is challenged by a new antithesis. Together they can produce a fresh synthesis. And all that is very familiar. What is new and trying is the sweep and pace of innovation today, plus -- and this is what we sometimes forget -- the political volatility of the value systems that this can induce. If you doubt that, consider the Buchanan campaign and what's been going on with the Endowment for the Arts and public broadcasting. These are signs of people running scared, and they can cause damage. So the answer for the 21st century is to proceed under power, but with restraint, to practice what Mitch Kapor in another connection called toleration for opposing forces and perspectives. We need each other to keep the enterprise together and on course. For computer practitioners represented in this room, this means restraint from provoking unnecessary and damaging social backlash. A good example might be New York telcos offering free per-call and per-line blocking with this caller identification service. For regulators and law enforcers, restraint means asking, \"Do you know enough to freeze emerging conduct in a particular form or pattern?\" I was very taken by the role reversal exercise organized by Michael Gibbons on Wednesday night. It led me to wonder what might have happened to the government's wiretapping and encryption proposals had they been subjected to a comparable advanced exercise before introduction. Sixteen years ago in Aspen, Colorado, I convened a gathering of federal policymakers and invited them to consider a suggested matrix of policy values and processes in the information society.",
      "So it is no longer true that national power and national security are increased when government has the sole right to gather intelligence and encipher communications. Now the strength of a country depends not only on its government, but also on its corporations. The old premises have fallen away in the new reality, but the old policy remains. It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage. Well, digital media -- computer-based communications -- are the printing press of the 21st century, and as the printing press transformed society, created the modern individual, gave rise to the basis of the democratic state and to the notion of individual rights, I suspect that we will see a similar, radical transformation of the very constitution of global society in the next century, facilitated by this enabling technology. I would be the last person to try to sketch out the details, or tell you what the issues are going to be, but I want to share with you some feelings about what is really going to matter, as we go about this -- and I'll start with something about myself. You see a guy wearing a suit; most of you know I have a lot of money -- I'm a successful businessman. God knows what images propagate around the media and settle in people's minds, but I've always seen myself, and felt myself to the core of my being, as an outsider, every bit as much as a self-proclaimed outsider, as Tom Jennings -- who spoke so eloquently about this at the Pioneer awards* yesterday -- was. *The Electronic Freedom Foundation presented its first awards at a related, adjacent reception which was not formally a part of the conference. I think we are all outsiders; we are all different, all unique. We're not the same. We share an underlying common humanity, but we should not be asked to subjugate ourselves to some form of mass society that causes us each to become indistinguishable from one another. I believe that computer- based communications technology is an enabling technology to liberate individuals and to free us from the oppressive influence of large institutions, whether those are public or private."

      "Hugh Hilton Goodwin (December 21, 1900 \u2013 February 25, 1980) was a decorated officer in the United States Navy with the rank of Vice Admiral. A veteran of both World Wars, he commanded escort carrier  during the Mariana Islands campaign. Goodwin then served consecutively as Chief of Staff, Carrier Strike Group 6 and as Air Officer, Philippine Sea Frontier and participated in the Philippines campaign in the later part of the War. Following the War, he remained in the Navy and rose to the flag rank and held several important commands including Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service, Commander, Carrier Division Two and Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command. Early life and career\n\nHugh H. Goodwin was born on December 21, 1900, in Monroe, Louisiana and attended Monroe High School there (now Neville High School). Following the United States' entry into World War I in April 1917, Goodwin left the school without receiving the diploma in order to see some combat and enlisted the United States Navy on May 7, 1917. He completed basic training and was assigned to the battleship . Goodwin participated in the training of armed guard crews and engine room personnel as the Atlantic Fleet prepared to go to war and in November 1917, he sailed with the rest of Battleship Division 9, bound for Britain to reinforce the Grand Fleet in the North Sea. Although he did not complete the last year of high school, Goodwin was able to earn an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1918. While at the academy, he earned a nickname \"Huge\" and among his classmates were several future admirals and generals including: Hyman G. Rickover, Milton E. Miles, Robert E. Blick Jr., Herbert S. Duckworth, Clayton C. Jerome, James P. Riseley, James A. Stuart, Frank Peak Akers, Sherman Clark, Raymond P. Coffman, Delbert S. Cornwell, Frederick J. Eckhoff, Ralph B. DeWitt, John Higgins, Vernon Huber, Albert K. Morehouse, Harold F. Pullen, Michael J. Malanaphy, William S. Parsons, Harold R. Stevens, John P. Whitney, Lyman G. Miller and George J. O'Shea.",
      "He also completed correspondence course in International law at the Naval War College. Goodwin was appointed Commanding officer of the Observation Squadron 1 in June 1938 and attached to the battleship  he took part in the patrolling of the Pacific and \nWest Coast of the United States until September 1938, when he assumed command of the Observation Squadron 2 attached to the battleship . When his old superior from Lexington, now Rear Admiral Arthur B. Cook, was appointed Commander Aircraft, Scouting Force in June 1939, he requested Goodwin as his Aide and Flag Secretary. He became Admiral Cook's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and after year and half of service in the Pacific, he continued as his Aide and Flag Secretary, when Cook was appointed Commander Aircraft, Atlantic Fleet in November 1940. World War II\n\nFollowing the United States' entry into World War II, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Commander on January 1, 1942, and assumed duty as advisor to the Argentine Navy. His promotion was made permanent two months later and he returned to the United States in early 1943 for duty as assistant director of Planning in the Bureau of Aeronautics under Rear admiral John S. McCain. While still in Argentina, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Captain on June 21, 1942. By the end of December 1943, Goodwin was ordered to Astoria, Oregon, where he assumed command of newly commissioned escort carrier USS Gambier Bay. He was responsible for the initial training of the crew and was known as a strict disciplinarian, but the crew appreciated the skills he taught them that prepared them for combat. Goodwin insisted that everyone aboard has to do every job right every time and made us fight our ship at her best. During the first half of 1944, Gambier Bay was tasked with ferrying aircraft for repairs and qualified carrier pilots from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before departed on May 1, 1944, to join Rear admiral Harold B. Sallada's Carrier Support Group 2, staging in the Marshalls for the invasion of the Marianas."

      "Fundamentally, indenofluorenes represent model systems to study the interplay between aromaticity and magnetism at the molecular scale . Motivated by many of these prospects, the last decade has witnessed intensive synthetic efforts toward the realization of indenofluorenes. Derivatives of 1-4 have been realized in solution , while 1-3 have also been synthesized on surfaces and characterized using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), which provide information on molecular orbital densities , molecular structure and oxidation state . With regards to the open-shell character of indenofluorenes, 2-4 are theoretically and experimentally interpreted to be closed-shell, while calculations indicate that 1 and 5 should exhibit open-shell ground states . Bulk characterization of mesitylsubstituted 1, including X-ray crystallography, temperature-dependent NMR, and electron spin resonance spectroscopy, provided indications of its open-shell ground state . Electronic characterization of 1 on Au(111) surface using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) revealed a low electronic gap of 0.4 eV (ref. ). However, no experimental proof of an openshell ground state of 1 on Au(111), such as detection of singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs) or spin excitations and correlations due to unpaired electrons , was shown. In this work, we report the generation and characterization of unsubstituted 5. Our research is motivated by theoretical calculations that indicate 5 to exhibit the largest diradical character among all indenofluorene isomers . The same calculations also predict that 5 should possess a triplet ground state. Therefore, 5 would qualify as a Kekul\u00e9 triplet, of which only a handful of examples exist . However, definitive synthesis of 5 has never been reported so far. Previously, Dressler et al. reported transient isolation of mesityl-substituted 5, where it decomposed both in the solution and in solid state , and only the structural proof of the corresponding dianion was obtained.",
      "On-surface generation of a derivative of 5, starting from truxene as a precursor, was recently reported . STM data on this compound, containing the indeno[1,2-a]fluorene moiety as part of a larger PCH, was interpreted to indicate its open-shell ground state. However, the results did not imply the ground state of unsubstituted 5. Here, we show that on insulating surfaces 5 can exhibit either of two ground states: an open-shell or a closed-shell. We infer the existence of these two ground states based on high-resolution AFM imaging with bond-order discrimination and STM imaging of molecular orbital densities . AFM imaging reveals molecules with two different geometries. Characteristic bond-order differences in the two geometries concur with the geometry of either an open-or a closed-shell state. Concurrently, STM images at ionic resonances show molecular orbital densities corresponding to SOMOs for the open-shell geometry, but orbital densities of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for the closed-shell geometry. Our experimental results are in good agreement with density functional theory (DFT) and multireference perturbation theory calculations. Finally, we observe switching between open-and closed-shell states of a single molecule by changing its adsorption site on the surface. Synthetic strategy toward indeno[1,2-a]fluorene. The generation of 5 relies on the solution-phase synthesis of the precursor 7,12-dihydro indeno[1,2-a]fluorene (6). Details on synthesis and characterization of 6 are reported in Supplementary Figs.\n. Single molecules of 6 are deposited on coinage metal (Au(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111)) or insulator surfaces. In our work, insulating surfaces correspond to two monolayer-thick (denoted as bilayer) NaCl on coinage metal surfaces. Voltage pulses ranging between 4-6 V are applied by the tip of a combined STM/AFM system, which result in cleavage of one C-H bond at each of the pentagonal apices of 6, thereby leading to the generation of 5 (Fig. )."

      "Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was drowned in the love for the Holy Prophet, Sayyiduna Rasulullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). Everything he did was for the pleasure of Almighty Allah and Sayyiduna Rasulullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). All that he had gained was due to the intense love which he possessed for the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). His extreme and intense love for the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) can be understood by the fact that during the latter stages of his life, even though he was very ill, he would sit for hours with great respect in the Naath Mehfils and would shed tears in his love for Sayyiduna Rasulullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). He used to celebrate the Meelad-un-Nabi (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) each year with great splendour. The programme used to begin on the eve of the 12th of Rabi-ul-Awwal and used to continue till the next day just before lunch. The invitation was open to all Muslims and they all used to be fed. Even after examining the Naath Shareefs written by Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) one would see that every word written dislayed his measureless love for the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). In the world of poetry, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was a Giant of his time. Most of his poems were in the form of Humd (Praise of Allah), Naath Shareef, Qasidas and Manqabats compiled in the Arabic, Urdu, Persian and Hindi languages. All these poems were compiled into a book which is famously known as \"Samaane Bakhshish\" which is still available toady. Samaane Bakhshsish is a treasure chest which flows with pearls of love for Sayyiduna Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). The compilation of Samaane Bakhshish is through the blessings of Sayyiduna Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). \"Ye Dil Ye Jigr Hai Ye Aankhe Ye Sar Hai, Jaha Chaaho Rakho Qadam Ghause Azam\"\n\"Once a very young descendant of Sayyiduna Sheikh Abdul Qaadir Jilani (radi Allahu anhu), Hazrat Peer Taahir Ala'uddeen (radi Allahu anhu), visited Bareilly Shareef.",

Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) used to walk bare feet behind him with great respect. \"\nThe great Ulema of the time have stated that Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was lost to such an extent in the love for Sayyiduna Ghousul Azam, Sheikh Abdul Qaadir Jilani (radi Allahu anhu) that even physically he began to resemble Sheikh Abdul Qaadir Jilani (radi Allahu anhu). \"Dekh Kar Shakle Mufti Azam, Ghause Azam ki Yaad Aayi he\"\nGhousul Waqt, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) had great respect and love for the Ulema and for Sayeds (Descendants of Sayyiduna Rasulullah sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). The respect which he showed towards them is beyond explanation. One day, in 1979, a lady came with her little child to ask for Ta'weez. It was a very hot day and she was informed that Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was resting. The lady, however, was in great need for the particular Ta'weez. She asked someone to see if Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was awake but nobody had the nerve of going near him while he was resting as they considered this to be disrespectful. Taking her child she commented, \"What did we know that the words of Sayeds will not be heard in this place\". It is not known how Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) heard this, but he immediately summoned one of the Mureeds. He instructed him to call the lady and not give her grief. The woman then sent her child to Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). He asked the child's name and showed great love and respect towards this young child. With great affection, he placed his hand on the child's head. He even asked someone to bring an apple for the child. From behind the curtain, he spoke to the lady concerning her problem and immediately wrote a Ta'weez for her. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) then sent a message to his family requesting that the mother and child should only be allowed to leave after the heat became less intense; that they should be well entertained and that no shortage should be spared in entertaining these Sayeds."

      "A) Born believed that increased regulation would stifle innovation, while Greenspan argued that existing regulations were sufficient to maintain market stability.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "Their response dismissed Born's analysis and focused on the hypothetical possibility that CFTC regulation of swaps and other OTC derivative instruments could create a \"legal uncertainty\" regarding such financial instruments,  hypothetically reducing the value of the instruments. They argued that the imposition of regulatory costs would \"stifle financial innovation\" and encourage financial capital to transfer its  transactions offshore. The disagreement between Born and the Executive Office's top economic policy advisors has been described not only as a classic Washington turf war, but also a war of ideologies,  insofar as it is possible to argue that Born's actions were consistent with Keynesian and neoclassical economics while Greenspan, Rubin, Levitt, and Summers consistently espoused neoliberal, and neoconservative policies. In 1998, a trillion-dollar hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was near collapse. Using mathematical models to calculate debt risk, LTCM used derivatives to leverage $5 billion into more than $1 trillion, doing business with fifteen of Wall Street's largest financial institutions. The derivative transactions were not regulated, nor were investors able to evaluate LTCM's exposures. Born stated, \"I thought that LTCM was exactly what I had been worried about\". In the last weekend of September 1998, the President's working group was told that the entire American economy hung in the balance. After intervention by the Federal Reserve, the crisis was averted. In congressional hearings into the crisis, Greenspan acknowledged that language had been introduced into an agriculture bill that would prevent CFTC from regulating the derivatives which were at the center of the crisis that threatened the US economy. U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) asked \"How many more failures do you think we'd have to have before some regulation in this area might be appropriate?\" In response, Greenspan brushed aside the substance of Born's warnings with the simple assertion that \"the degree of supervision of regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market is quite adequate to maintain a degree of stability in the system\".",

    "question": "Given the emphasis on tempo and offensive innovation in recent college football, what factors might make a candidate like Chad Morris a less than ideal fit for the head coaching position at BC, despite his impressive track record?",
    "choices": [
      "A) Morris's lack of experience coaching at a high-profile program like BC.",
      "B) The potential cultural clash between Morris's background in high school football and the demands of a major university.",
      "C) The limited pool of qualified offensive coordinators available for the head coaching position.",
      "D) The need for a head coach with experience in a pro-style offense, which is not Morris's primary expertise."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "What are his expectations for the offense? Does he think the increased tempo will impact the defensive side of the ball?\n-- What will Bollman's role be as \"running game coordinator\"? Is Bollman using different techniques and or approaches to the offensive line play?\n-- What traits was he looking for as he hired new coaches to replace the departed?\n-- As a Penn State alum and former player, what are his thoughts on the Freeh report? Are the former players talking among themselves about what they can do to help rebuild the Penn State football reputation? What does he want done with the Paterno statue? -- When did the staff approach him about moving to the left side? How is he preparing for the new position? --Who is leading the OL drills in the offseason? -- How are things different with a new position coach? What will fans see?\n-- What aspects of his game is he focusing on this year? -- How is Chase Rettig adjusting to the new offense?\n-- Which offensive player will surprise BC fans this year? Who is going to make a big leap? -- What are his expectations for the season? How important is it to the Seniors to get back to a winning record and a bowl game?\n-- How is his health?\n-- What was it like to sit out a season?\n-- Earlier in his career there was speculation that he might transfer from BC. How does it feel to be a 5th year senior at BC now?\n-- Last year BC played more three man fronts than ever before. Will we see more of that this year?\n-- Does the talk of an NFL career add any extra motivation? We know Blauds and HD will be in Greensboro. Hopefully they or others will slip in one or two of these questions. I don't expect anything particularly revealing, but I would like to hear Spaz talk about the pressure of the season. Labels: ACC Media Day, emmett cleary, fire Spaz, Kaleb Ramsey, Speculating with Spaz\nWillis commits, decommits and then commits, and other links\nIt was a strange night if you follow BC recruiting on Twitter. First Rivals reported Georgia running back Myles Willis' commitment.",
      "The natural inclination would be for BC to replace Spaz with an offensive guy. Unfortunately there is not a great pool of candidates among current college offensive coordinators. There are plenty of good coordinators, but I don't know how many are ready to be head coaches or coach at a place like BC. These are some of the more prominent names. After the 2012 season, we'll have a better idea of if they are ready to take on an FBS head coaching job. Chad Morris\nOffensive Coordinator, Clemson\nChad Morris was coaching high school football three years ago. His meteoric rise to Clemson's playcaller is another example of how much college football has changed. Gus Malzahn and guys like Chip Kelly and Art Briles before him shot from relative obscurity to changing college football within a few season. Pedigree and climbing the ladders doesn't mean as much anymore. All that matters is how you score and Morris showed that he could give new life to Clemson's attack. Like the others mentioned Morris emphasized tempo and a no huddle. His track record is impressive, as is his reputation for teaching and implementing this offense. What to Watch for in 2012: Can Clemson keep it up? The ACC now has a chance to adjust to his scheme. It will also be interested to know what Morris wants to do. All these guys want to be head coaches, but is he willing to roll the dice on a job like BC? Would he even fit in? BC's very different from coaching high school in west Texas. Offensive Coordinator, Wisconsin\nThe Badgers have been a good proving ground for coordinators. I like the fit for BC since Wisconsin tends to develop and recruit like we do. They also have run \"pro style\" offenses with an emphasis on OL and the running attacks. Canada will be new there this fall, but he's got BCS experience and led explosive offenses in the MAC too. If Canada became a candidate for BC, I would have hesitation about his time at Indiana. They threw it a ton while he was calling plays but didn't win much. What to Watch in 2012: Will Canada keep throwing it at the more conservative Wisconsin?"

      "He would reply to all those who made Salaam to him. On entering the Masjid, he would immediately recite the dua prescribed. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) would then remove his Amaama and then sit down to perform Wudhu. He would wash all the parts thoroughly so that the Sunnahs were accomplished. He would perform his Salaah with great sincerity and used to be lost in the worship of his Creator. The person who looked at him from a distance would have instantly understood that Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) had left all the worldly desires and was intent upon pleasing his Creator. Once, while Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was traveling from Nagpur, it was time for Maghrib Salaah. He immediately disembarked from the train. The people told Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) that the train was about to leave, but he was intent on performing his Salaah. His companions also disembarked with him. They had just performed their Wudhu and were making Niyyah for Salaah when the train left the station. All of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) and his companions luggages' were left on the train. A few un-Islamic people who were there said \"the Mias train had left him\". Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was still in Salaah. When they all had completed their Salaah, they noticed that the station platform was empty. They became a little worried since all their luggage had gone with the train, but still Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) looked undisturbed. His companions were busy talking about the luggage when they noticed the station guard, followed by a group of travellers, running towards them. The guard came up to Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and said, \"Huzoor! The train is stuck!\" Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) said, \"The engine is damaged.\" The train was brought back and Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and his companions sat in the train. After some repairs the train left with him and his companions seated in it!",
      "When Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) saw them, he reprimanded them and told them to desist from such a Haraam act. They did not listen to his advise so he scolded the leader of the group who was a young and well-built person. He gave the young person a hard slap which caused the bottle of alcohol to fall far from his hand. The Khaadim expected the person to retaliate but, who had the nerve to retaliate against this Lion of Islam! They became afraid and sat down quietly. Later some of them came up to Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and begged for forgiveness for their shameful behavior. \"Tassawuf, Philsafa, Tafseer ki fiqhi Masa'il, Subhi kahte hai ke Aqida Kusha he Mufti Azam\"\nMufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu), who after writing his first Fatawa while still a student at \"Darul Uloom Manzare Islam\", was given the status of Mufti due to his immense knowledge. When the Muslim World began to see his knowledge and Fatawas brightenening the world, they began calling him \"Mufti-e-Azam\" or The Most Exalted Mufti of the Time. This title alone became the name he was recognised by. Whenever the name \"Mufti Azam Hind\" was mentioned, it referred to none other than his exalted personality. Remember that he or she only is exalted who has been blessed with this excellence by Almighty Allah and His Beloved Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was a personality free from pride, lavishness and self- fame. His status was bestowed upon him by Almighty Allah and His Beloved Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). That person to whom Almighty Allah and His Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) grants such excellence, then such excellence cannot be understood by ordinary mortals. This is one of the reasons why the entire world was brightened and received the benefits of his knowledge of Fiqh. There came a stage when Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was not only known as \"Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind\" but he was also known as \"Mufti-e-Azam-e-Alam\" or The Grand Mufti of the World."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "documentation": [
      "Moreover, we have used the implementation available on the powerlaw Python package . In addition to obtaining the power-law exponents, we have also verified the adequacy of the power-law hypothesis using the procedure originally proposed by Clauset et al. as adapted by Preis et al. . This procedure consists of generating synthetic samples under the power-law hypothesis with the same properties of the empirical data under analysis (that is, same length and parameters \u03b1 and r min ), adjusting the simulated data with the power-law model via the Clauset-Shalizi-Newman method, and calculating the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic (\u03ba syn ) between the distributions obtained from the simulated samples and the adjusted power-law model. Next, the values of \u03ba syn are compared to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic calculated between empirical data and the power-law model (\u03ba). Finally, a p-value is defined by calculating the fraction of times for which \u03ba syn > \u03ba. We have used one thousand synthetic samples for each position of the expanding time window and the more conservative 90% confidence level (instead of the more lenient and commonly used 95% confidence level), such that the power-law hypothesis is rejected whenever p-value \u2264 0.1. We have estimated the effects of age and market capitalization on the power-law exponents associated with positive or negative returns of a given cryptocurrency using the linear model where \u03b1 t represents the power-law exponent, log c t is the logarithm of the market capitalization, and y t is the age (in years) of the cryptocurrency at t-th observation. Moreover, K is the intercept of the association, while C and A are linear coefficients quantifying the effects of market capitalization and age, respectively. Finally, N (\u00b5, \u03c3 ) stands for the normal distribution with mean \u00b5 and standard deviation \u03c3 , such that the parameter \u03b5 accounts for the unobserved determinants in the dynamics of the power-law exponents. We have framed this problem using the hierarchical Bayesian approach such that each power-law exponent \u03b1 t is nested within a cryptocurrency with model parameters considered as random variables normally distributed with parameters that are also random variables.",
      "In each step, we separate the positive from the negative return values and estimate their power-law behavior using the Clauset-Shalizi-Newman method . Figure (a) further illustrates this procedure, where the vertical dashed line represents a given position of the time window (t = 2004 days), the blue and red lines indicate positive and negative returns, respectively, and the gray lines show the return observations that will be included in the expanding time window in future steps. Moreover, Fig. (b) shows the corresponding survival functions (or complementary cumulative distributions) for the positive (blue) and negative (red) returns of Bitcoin within the time window highlighted in Fig. (a). These survival functions correspond to return values above the lower bound of the power-law regime (r min ) and dashed lines in Fig. (b) show the power-law functions adjusted to data, that is,\nwith \u03b1 = 4.5 for the positive returns and \u03b1 = 3.0 for the negative returns in this particular position of the time window (t = 2004 days). We have further verified the goodness of the power-law fits using the approach proposed by Clauset et al. (see also Preis et al. ). As detailed in the Methods section, this approach consists in generating several synthetic samples under the power-law hypothesis, adjusting these simulated samples, and estimating the fraction of times the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between the adjusted power-law and the synthetic samples is larger than the value calculated from the empirical data. This fraction defines a p-value and allows us to reject or not the power-law hypothesis of the return distributions under a given confidence level. Following Refs. we consider the more conservative 90% confidence level (instead of the more lenient and commonly used 95% confidence level), rejecting the power-law hypothesis when p-value \u2264 0.1. For the particular examples in Fig. (b), the p-values are respectively 1.00 and 0.17 for the positive and negative returns, and thus we cannot reject the power-law hypotheses."

The percent errors (relative to the transport solution) for the scalar flux obtained with the LO equation and with the standard FP equation at the center of the slab are shown in \\cref{momcomp}. It can be seen that the percent relative errors in the scalar flux of the FP solution is orders of magnitude larger than the error produced using the LO equation.

      "The basic idea is that the COM of blobs behaves like \nthe one of an infinitely long plasma column immersed in an ambient plasma. The dynamics of this column reduces to the one of a two-dimensional ball. This idea is similar to the analytical ``top hat'' density solution for\nblob dynamics recently studied in~\\cite{Pecseli2016}. The ball is subject to buoyancy as well as linear and nonlinear friction\n\\begin{align}\n  M_{\\text{i}} \\frac{d V}{d t} = (M_{\\text{g}} - M_\\text{p}) g - c_1 V  - \\mathrm{sgn}(V ) \\frac{1}{2}c_2 V^2. \\label{eq:ball}\n\\end{align}\nThe gravity $g$ has a positive sign in the coordinate system; sgn$(f)$ is the sign function. The first term on the right hand side is the buoyancy, where \n$M_{\\text{g}} := \\pi \\ell^2 (n_0 + \\mathcal Q \\triangle n/2)$ \nis the gravitational mass of the ball with radius $\\ell$ and \n$M_\\mathrm{p} := n_0 \\pi \\ell^2 $ \nis the mass of the displaced ambient plasma. Note that if $\\triangle n<0$ the ball represents a depletion and the buoyancy term has a negative sign, i.e. the depletion will rise. We introduce an inertial mass \n$M_{\\text{i}} := \\pi\\ell^2 (n_0 +2\\triangle n/9)$ \ndifferent from the gravitational mass $M_{\\text{g}}$ in order to \nrecover the initial acceleration in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:acceleration}. We interpret the parameters $\\mathcal Q$ and $2/9$ as geometrical factors \nthat capture the difference of the actual blob form from the idealized\n``top hat'' solution. Also note that the Boussinesq approximation appears in the model as a neglect of inertia, $M_{\\text{i}} = \\pi\\ell^2n_0$. The second term is the linear friction term with coefficient $c_1(\\ell)$, which\ndepends on the size of the ball. If we disregard the nonlinear friction, $c_2=0$, Eq.~\\eqref{eq:ball} directly yields a \nmaximum velocity $c_1V^*=\\pi \\ell^2 n g \\mathcal Q\\triangle n/2$.\nFrom our previous considerations $\\max V/\\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}=\\mathcal Q \\triangle n /2n_0$, we thus identify \n\\begin{align}\n  c_1 = \\pi\\ell^2 n_0 g/\\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}. \\label{}\n\\end{align}\nThe linear friction coefficient thus depends on the gravity and the size of the\nball."

I do think a program like BC is probably more patient with players than some of the bigger programs. We won't rush a guy out of the program to free up a scholarship. We prefer to redshirt. And I think the nature of a program -- with good academic support and less of a big school mentality -- keeps kids from falling through the cracks. Every recruit thinks they are going to be a star, so selling them on development and a safety net doesn't sway many, but it should. If anything BC should use a guy like Marcus Grant -- a local kid who left a Big Ten program to come \"home\" as an example to Massachusetts recruits. Massachusetts kids keep leaving to play at the \"highest level.\" Our counter should be that we will develop them for life and the NFL (the real highest level) and not chew them up and spit them out like a football factory. I am sure that there will be a guy in the near future who decommits from BC and becomes a star. Or a guy we should have had who leads another team to glory. Right now I am just glad that we have very few regrets when it comes to old recruits. Our recruiting still has major challenges, but that's one area where things have broken our way.

When was the last time a great recruit spurned BC and became a star? I can think of a few over the years, but most of the recruits that \"got away\" had middling careers elsewhere. Some recent examples of guys who spurned us include Graham Stewart, Arthur Lynch and Joe Boisture. All three committed to BC at one point only to rethink their decisions and go to bigger programs. Stewart washed out at Florida and is now sitting out a transfer year at UConn. Boisture is out of football altogether. Lynch has been a backup at Georgia. He has a chance for a bigger role this season, but so far has not lived up to the hype that surrounded his recruitment. Even with our terrible offense, Chris Pantale has had a much more productive Tight End career. The closest thing I can think of to a recent recruit who had success elsewhere is Virginia OT Oday Aboushi. But should he even count? He didn't spurn BC.

      "D) Social shadowing introduces a structured latent space for communication, facilitating the development of more robust and efficient communication strategies that require fewer samples for convergence."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "Next, we analyze the ability of heterogeneous agents to understand differing communication policies (H2)). Finally, we consider the effect of social shadowing (H3), in which agents solely learn a communication policy from an expert agent's action policy. We additionally analyze the role of offline reinforcement learning for emergent communication in combination with online reinforcement learning to further learn emergent communication alongside an action policy. We evaluate each scenario over 10 seeds. Environments\n\nBlind Traffic Junction We consider a benchmark that requires both referential and ordinal capabilities within a team of agents. The blind traffic junction environment requires multiple agents to navigate a junction without any observation of other agents. Rather, they only observe their own state location. Ten agents must coordinate to traverse through the lanes without colliding into agents within their lane or in the junction. Our training uses REINFORCE . Pascal VOC Game We further evaluate the complexity of compositional communication with a Pascal VOC . This is a two-agent referential game similar to the Cifar game but requires the prediction of multiple classes. During each episode, each agent observes a random image from the Pascal VOC dataset containing exactly two unique labels. Each agent must encode information given only the raw pixels from the original image such that the other agent can recognize the two class labels in the original image. An agent receives a reward of 0.25 per correctly chosen class label and will receive a total reward of 1 if both agents guess all labels correctly. See figure 2. Our training uses heterogeneous agents trained with PPO (modified from MAPPO repository). For simplicity of setup, we consider images with exactly two unique labels from a closed subset of size five labels of the original set of labels from the Pascal VOC data. Furthermore, these images must be of size 375 \u00d7 500 pixels. Thus, the resultant dataset comprised 534 unique images from the Pascal VOC dataset.",
      "Social Shadowing\n\nCritics of emergent communication may point to the increased sample complexity due to the dual communication and action policy learning. In the social shadowing scenario, heterogeneous agents can learn to generate a communication policy without learning the action policy of the watched expert agents. To enable social shadowing, the agent will alternate between a batch of traditional MARL (no expert) and (1st-person) shadowing an expert agent performing the task in its trajectory. The agent only uses the contrastive objective to update its communication policy during shadowing. In figure , the agent that performs social shadowing is able to learn the action policy with almost half the sample complexity required by the online reinforcement learning agent. Our results show that the structured latent space of the emergent communication learns socially benevolent coordination. This tests our hypothesis that by learning communication to understand the actions of other agents, one can enable lower sample complexity coordination. Thus, it mitigates the issues of solely observing actions. Discussion\n\nBy using our framework to better understand the intent of others, agents can learn to communicate to align policies and coordinate. Any referential-based setup can be performed with a supervised loss, as indicated by the instant satisfaction of referential objectives. Even in the Pascal VOC game, which appears to be a purely referential objective, our results show that intelligent compression is not the only objective of referential communication. The emergent communication paradigm must enable an easy-to-discriminate space for the game. In multi-agent settings, the harder challenge is to enable coordination through communication. Using contrastive communication as an optimal critic aims to satisfy this, and has shown solid improvements. Since contrastive learning benefits from good examples, this method is even more powerful when there is access to examples from expert agents."

      "Weep Not, Child is a 1964 novel by Kenyan author Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o. It was his first novel, published in 1964 under the name James Ngugi. It was among the African Writers Series. It was the first English language|English novel to be published by an East African. Thiong'o's works deal with the relationship between Africans and white settlers in colonial Kenya, and are heavily critical of colonial rule. Specifically, Weep Not, Child deals with the Mau Mau Uprising, and \"the bewildering dispossession of an entire people from their ancestral land.\" Ng\u0169g\u0129 wrote the novel while he was a student at Makerere University. The book is divided into two parts and eighteen chapters. Part one deals mostly with the education of Njoroge, while part two deals with the rising Mau Mau movement. Plot summary\n\nNjoroge, a little boy, is urged to attend school by his mother. He is the first one of his family able to go to school. His family lives on the land of Jacobo, an African made rich by his dealings with white settlers, namely Mr. Howlands, the most powerful land owner in the area. Njoroge's brother Kamau works as an apprentice to a carpenter, while Boro, the eldest living son, is troubled by his experiences while in forced service during World War II, including witnessing the death of his elder brother. Ngotho, Njoroge's father and a respected man in the surrounding area, tends Mr. Howlands' crops, but is motivated by his passion to preserve his ancestral land, rather than for any compensation or loyalty. One day, black workers call for a strike to obtain higher wages. Ngotho is ambivalent about participating in the strike because he fears he will lose his job. However, he decides to go to the gathering, even though his two wives do not agree. At the demonstration, there are calls for higher wages. Suddenly, the white police inspector brings Jacobo to the gathering to pacify the native people. Jacobo tries to put an end to the strike. Ngotho attacks Jacobo, and the result is a riot where two people are killed.",
      "It is eventually revealed that Boro is the leader of the Mau Mau (earlier alluded to as \"entering politics\") and murders Mr.Howlands. He is caught by police immediately after and is scheduled to be executed by the book's end. It is highly likely that it is also Boro who kills Jacobo. Mwihaki: Njoroge's best friend (and later develops into his love interest). Daughter of Jacobo. When it is revealed that his family killed Jacobo (most likely Boro), Mwihaki distances herself from Njoroge, asking for time to mourn her father and care for her mother. Jacobo: Mwihaki's father and an important landowner. Chief of the village. Mr. Howlands: A white settler who emigrated to colonial Kenya and now owns a farm made up of land that originally belonged to Ngotho's ancestors. Has three children: Peter who died in World War II before the book's beginning, a daughter who becomes a missionary, and Stephen who met Njoroge while the two were in high school. Themes and motifs\nWeep Not, Child integrates Gikuyu mythology and the ideology of nationalism that serves as catalyst for much of the novel's action. The novel explores the negative aspects of colonial rule over Kenya. Njoroge's aspiration to attend university is frustrated by both the violence of the Mau Mau rebels and the violent response of the colonial government. This disappointment leads to his alienation from his family and ultimately his suicide attempt. The novel also ponders the role of saviours and salvation. The author notes in his The River Between: \"Salvation shall come from the hills. From the blood that flows in me, I say from the same tree, a son shall rise. And his duty shall be to lead and save the people.\" Jomo Kenyatta, the first prime minister of Kenya, is immortalised in Weep Not, Child. The author says, \"Jomo had been his (Ngotho's) hope. Ngotho had come to think that it was Jomo who would drive away the white man. To him, Jomo stood for custom and traditions purified by grace of learning and much travel.\" Njoroge comes to view Jomo as a messiah who will win the struggle against the colonial government."

      "Thank you for your assistance. I just listed to your tapes on dealing with an out of control, defiant teen. I'd like to ask your advice on a particular situation we have. Our 15 year old daughter is smoking pot almost every day at school. Because we had no way to control the situation, we told her, fine, go ahead and smoke weed. However, you will no longer receive the same support from us. You will not have your phone, lunch money to go off campus (she has an account at the school for the cafeteria she can use), and you will be grounded until you can pass a drug test. We will not be testing you except for when you tell us you are ready to be tested. She is now saying she's suicidal because she feels so isolated, yet she continues to smoke weed. In fact, she tried to sneak out last night but was foiled by our alarm system. For the particular drug test we have, I read it takes about 10 days of not smoking to pass the test. What would you do? Please advise. I am having a problem with my 18 year old son, Danny, with high functioning autism. We finally had him diagnosed when he was 16 years old. I always knew something was going on with him but the doctors misdiagnosed him as bipolar. It's been 2 years now and he will not accept his diagnosis. He won't talk about it and when I try to bring it up he gets very angry. I've tried telling him that it's not a bad thing, that there's been many, many very successful people with Aspergers. He won't tell anyone and refuses to learn about managing life with it. He once shared with me that the other kids at school use it as an insult, like saying someone is so autistic when they do something they don't approve of. So he doesn't want anyone to know. He's turned down services that could help him. He has a girlfriend, going on 8 months. He won't tell her and they're having problems arguing a lot and I wonder if it would help for her to know. I'm sad that he thinks it's a life sentence to something horrible instead of accepting, embracing it and learning about it more so he maybe can understand why he's struggling.",
      "We changed her diet and tried getting her involved with activities but she is anti-social and prefers reading than being social. She is terrified of change even in daily routine (even that will trigger prolonged crying). It frustrates me because I don't know what else to do with her behavior. I've tried acupuncture (she refused at the first session); she refuses massage too. She is an honor-roll student at school and has very minimal issues at school but if she has had a bad day it does result in a tantrum or crying and defiance. How can I get her tested for Asperger's Syndrome? Last night our 24 year old son with Aspergers told his dad and I that he is pulling out of the 4 college classes that he recetnly enrolled in because he has not been attending class or turning in his assignments. He paid $2800 (his own money) for tuition and I reminded him of this when he told us but it did not seem to bother him. This is the 3rd time he has started college courses and has not completed them. (He also took some concurrent college classes while he was in high school that he failed). This is a son who basically had a 4.0 grade point average through 10th grade and got a 34 on the ACT the first time he took it. With the news that he was once again not sticking with college courses I did not sleep well. When I got up this mornning I began looking online for help in how to deal with his situation. I found your \"Launching Adult Children With Aspergers\" and purchased it. Most of what is included are things we have done or did with our son throughout his life. I was hoping for more help so I am emailing you now in hopes of more specific ideas. We noticed some things with our son, Taylor, as a yound child but as we had not heard of Aspergers at that time we just did what we thought would help him. As a toddler and a child at pre-school he generally went off on his own to play. When I talked to his pre-school teacher about my concerns (that I was worried he would end up a hermit) she said she did not see him being a loner and that he seemed to interact fine with others in many situations."

But shouldn\u2019t we be able to negotiate a better contract with this man? Retiring Chief Porky Mike Maloney is getting over $165,000 a year, just in salary. He will be getting over $100,000 to retire, for the rest of his life, plus medical benefits. Frankly, I predict he\u2019s carrying a colostomy bag within five years. Have you seen Trostle\u2019s contract? They signed it at council last Tuesday. But when we asked for it, they said we wouldn\u2019t be able to look at it until Friday. I was invited to go down to the clerk\u2019s office, at her convenience, 9 \u2013 5, during MY WORK DAY, to look at a contract that had already been signed. Why in the hell would I want to do that? They don\u2019t even offer you a decent cup of coffee. So no, I haven\u2019t seen it yet, but I\u2019m guessing, it\u2019s worse than Maloney\u2019s contract. A fellow taxpayer went down Friday and reports he has the contracts, but has not given me any details. I don\u2019t know if he had to pay for paper copies or what, but you can view it for free if you want to go down there. I\u2019ll get back to you when I got something.

      "To further confirm this result, we knocked-down GCN2 by RNA interference (RNAi), and incubated the cells with or without L-Histidinol for 6 h. As shown in Fig 8, treatment of HepG2-OA1 cells with L-Histidinol results in efficient transgene reactivation, even upon significant GCN2 downregulation, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Taken together, these data strongly support the conclusion that GCN2 is not necessary for transgene reactivation in response to EAA starvation, either in HeLa or in HepG2 cells. Fig 7. GCN2 knockout does not interfere with transgene reactivation in HepG2 cells. (A) Immunoblotting of protein extracts from the HepG2-OA1 parental cell line and GCN2-KO clones 185#27, E23, F22, F27, immunodecorated with anti-GCN2 antibody. Clone 185#27 results from the first round of selection, and was used to generate clones E23, F22, F27. Arrow, GCN2 specific band. For GCN2 protein quantification, Ponceau staining was used as loading control and data are expressed as fold change vs. parental cell line (= 1).

      "Thus, while the ISR appears widely activated upon EAA starvation, the upregulation of its downstream effector CHOP only partly correlates with transgene reactivation and may not be sufficient to induce it. The activation of the ISR upon AA starvation suggests that GCN2 may be involved in the transgene reactivation response. Therefore, we tested whether direct pharmacological activation of this kinase is sufficient to trigger the transgene reactivation similarly to starvation. In addition, we used pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR to corroborate previous negative results in HeLa cells  in the other cell lines under study. To this aim, HeLa-OA1 or GFP, HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of PP242 (mTOR inhibitor) or L-Histidinol (GCN2 activator, inhibiting tRNAHis charging by histidyl-tRNA synthetase), either alone or in combination for 24 h, compared to Met/Cys-deprived and full medium. As shown in Fig 4 and S5 Fig, while inhibition of mTORC1 consistently leads to minor or no effects, in agreement with previous findings , treatment with L-Histidinol results in efficient reactivation of the transgene in HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells, but not in HeLa cells. Fig 4. mTOR inhibition and GCN2 activation differently affect transgene expression in HeLa and HepG2 cells. Relative transgene (OA1) and CHOP mRNA abundance in HeLa-OA1 (A) and HepG2-OA1 (B) cells, cultured in Met/Cys-deprived medium, or in the presence of PP242 (mTOR inhibitor; 1\u20133 \u03bcM) or L-Histidinol (HisOH, GCN2 activator; 4\u201316 mM), either alone or in combination for 24\u201348 h, compared to full medium.

      "\\section{INTRODUCTION}\nThe Tevatron Collider Run II started in March 2002 and is expected\nto continue until the end of this decade. The Tevatron and the \ntwo detectors, CDF and D\\O, have been performing  well in 2004,\neach experiment is collecting data at the rate \nof $\\approx$10 pb$^{-1}$ per week. The total  luminosity accumulated by August 2004 is $\\approx$500 pb$^{-1}$\nper detector. The rich physics program includes the\nproduction and precision measurement of properties of  standard model (SM)\nobjects, as well as searches for phenomena beyond standard model. In this brief review we focus on areas of most interest \nto the lattice community. We present\nnew results on the top quark mass\nand their implication for the mass of the SM Higgs boson, \non searches for the SM Higgs boson, on evidence for the $X(3872)$ state, \non searches for pentaquarks, and on $b$ hadron properties. All Run II results presented here are preliminary. \\section{TOP QUARK MASS}\n\nThe experiments CDF and D\\O\\ published several direct  measurements of\nthe top quark pole mass, $\\ensuremath{M_{\\mathrm{top}}}$, \nbased on Run I data (1992-1996). The ``lepton $+$ jets'' channel yields the most precise determination of\n$\\ensuremath{M_{\\mathrm{top}}}$. Recently, the\nD\\O\\ collaboration published a new measurement~\\cite{Mtop1-D0-l+j-new},\nbased on a powerful analysis technique yielding  greatly improved precision. The differential probability \nthat the measured variables in any event correspond to the signal\nis calculated as a function of $\\ensuremath{M_{\\mathrm{top}}}$. \nThe maximum in the product of the individual event probabilities \nprovides the best estimate of $\\ensuremath{M_{\\mathrm{top}}}$.\nThe critical differences from previous analyses \nin the lepton $+$ jets decay channel lie in \nthe assignment of more \nweight to events that are well measured or more likely to correspond to  \n$t \\bar t$ signal, \nand  the handling of the combinations of final-state objects\n(lepton, jets, and imbalance in transverse momentum) \nand their identification with\ntop-quark decay products in an event.",

      "Thank you for your assistance. I just listed to your tapes on dealing with an out of control, defiant teen. I'd like to ask your advice on a particular situation we have. Our 15 year old daughter is smoking pot almost every day at school. Because we had no way to control the situation, we told her, fine, go ahead and smoke weed. However, you will no longer receive the same support from us. You will not have your phone, lunch money to go off campus (she has an account at the school for the cafeteria she can use), and you will be grounded until you can pass a drug test. We will not be testing you except for when you tell us you are ready to be tested. She is now saying she's suicidal because she feels so isolated, yet she continues to smoke weed. In fact, she tried to sneak out last night but was foiled by our alarm system. For the particular drug test we have, I read it takes about 10 days of not smoking to pass the test. What would you do? Please advise. I am having a problem with my 18 year old son, Danny, with high functioning autism. We finally had him diagnosed when he was 16 years old. I always knew something was going on with him but the doctors misdiagnosed him as bipolar. It's been 2 years now and he will not accept his diagnosis. He won't talk about it and when I try to bring it up he gets very angry. I've tried telling him that it's not a bad thing, that there's been many, many very successful people with Aspergers. He won't tell anyone and refuses to learn about managing life with it. He once shared with me that the other kids at school use it as an insult, like saying someone is so autistic when they do something they don't approve of. So he doesn't want anyone to know. He's turned down services that could help him. He has a girlfriend, going on 8 months. He won't tell her and they're having problems arguing a lot and I wonder if it would help for her to know. I'm sad that he thinks it's a life sentence to something horrible instead of accepting, embracing it and learning about it more so he maybe can understand why he's struggling."

      "Early life\nEnglish was born on 30 December 1961 at Lumsden Maternity Centre in Lumsden. He is the eleventh of twelve children of Mervyn English and Norah (n\u00e9e O'Brien) English. His parents purchased Rosedale, a mixed sheep and cropping farm in Dipton, Southland from Mervyn's uncle, Vincent English, a bachelor, in 1944. English was born in the maternity unit at Lumsden. English attended St Thomas's School in Winton, then boarded at St. Patrick's College in Upper Hutt, where he became head boy. He played in the first XV of the school's rugby team. English went on to study commerce at the University of Otago, where he was a resident at Selwyn College, and then completed an honours degree in English literature at Victoria University of Wellington. After finishing his studies, English returned to Dipton and farmed for a few years. From 1987 to 1989, he worked in Wellington as a policy analyst for the New Zealand Treasury, at a time when the free market policies favoured by Labour's finance minister Roger Douglas (known collectively as \"Rogernomics\") were being implemented. English joined the National Party in 1980, while at Victoria University. He served for a period as chairman of the Southland branch of the Young Nationals, and became a member of the Wallace electorate committee. After moving to Wellington, he served for periods on the Island Bay and Miramar electorate committees, respectively. Fourth National Government (1990\u20131999) At the 1990 general election, English stood as the National candidate in Wallace, replacing the retiring Derek Angus, and was elected with a large majority. He would hold this seat, renamed Clutha-Southland in 1996, until 2014. He and three other newly elected National MPs (Tony Ryall, Nick Smith, and Roger Sowry) were soon identified as rising stars in New Zealand politics, and at various points were dubbed the \"brat pack\", the \"gang of four\", and the \"young Turks\". In his first term in parliament, English chaired a select committee into social services. He was made a parliamentary under-secretary in 1993, serving under the Minister of Health.",
      "English had been a supporter of Bolger as leader, but Shipley reappointed him Minister of Health in her new cabinet. English was promoted to Minister of Finance in a reshuffle in January 1999, a position which was at the time subordinate to the Treasurer, Bill Birch. After a few months, the pair switched positions as part of Birch's transition to retirement, with English assuming the senior portfolio. In early interviews, he emphasised his wish to be seen as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue, and said that the initiatives of some of his predecessors (Roger Douglas's \"Rogernomics\" and Ruth Richardson's \"Ruthanasia\") had focused on \"fruitless, theoretical debates\" when \"people just want to see problems solved\". Opposition (1999\u20132008)\n\nAfter the National Party lost the 1999 election to Helen Clark's Labour Party, English continued on in the shadow cabinet as National's spokesperson for finance. He was elected deputy leader of the party in February 2001, following the resignation of Wyatt Creech, with Gerry Brownlee being his unsuccessful opponent. Leader of the Opposition\nIn October 2001, after months of speculation, Jenny Shipley resigned as leader of the National Party after being told she no longer had the support of the party caucus. English was elected as her replacement unopposed (with Roger Sowry as his deputy), and consequently became Leader of the Opposition. However, he did not openly organise against Shipley, and according to The Southland Times \"there was almost an element of 'aw, shucks, I'll do it then' about Mr English's ascension\". Aged 39 when he was elected, English became the second-youngest leader in the National Party's history, after Jim McLay (who was 38 when elected in 1984). He also became only the third Southlander to lead a major New Zealand political party, after Joseph Ward and Adam Hamilton. However, English failed to improve the party's performance. In the 2002 election, National suffered its worst electoral defeat ever, gaining barely more than twenty percent of the vote."

      "Finally, the former levels are classified regarding whether the power-law exponents increase, decrease or have a mixed trend with the predictive variables. Overall, 36% of the associations are classified as mixed trends (green rectangles), 28% are increasing trends (blue rectangles), and 26% are decreasing trends (red rectangles). We have studied the distributions of large price variations of a significant part of the digital assets that currently comprise the entirety of the cryptocurrency market. Unlike previous work, we have estimated these distributions for entire historical price records of each digital currency, and we have identified the patterns under which the return distributions change as cryptoassets age and grow in market capitalization. Similarly to conventional financial assets , our findings show that the return distributions of the vast majority of cryptoassets have tails that are described well by power-law functions along their entire history. The typical power-law exponents of cryptocurrencies (\u03b1 \u223c 3) are, however, significantly smaller than those reported for conventional assets (\u03b1 \u223c 4) . This feature corroborates the widespread belief that cryptoassets are indeed considerably more risky for investments than stocks or other more traditional financial assets. Indeed, we have found that about half of the cryptocurrencies in our analysis do not have a characteristic scale for price variations, and are thus prone to much higher price variations than those typically observed in stock markets. On the upside, we have also identified an asymmetry in the power-law exponents for positive and negative returns in about 2/3 of all considered cryptocurrencies, such that these exponents are smaller for positive than they are for negative returns. This means that sizable positive price variations have generally been more likely to occur than equally sizable negative price variations, which in turn may also reflect the recent overall expansion of the cryptocurrency market.",
      "Using a hierarchical Bayesian linear model, we have also simultaneously investigated the overall market characteristics and asset-specific tendencies regarding the effects of age and market capitalization on the power-law exponents. We have found that the cryptocurrency market is highly heterogeneous regarding the trends exhibited by each cryptocurrency; however, only a small fraction of cryptocurrencies (10%) have power-law exponents neither correlated with age nor market capitalization. These associations have been mostly ignored by the current literature and are probably related to the still-early developmental stage of the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Overall, 36% of cryptocurrencies present trends that do not systematically contribute to increasing or decreasing their power-law exponents as they age and grow in market capitalization. On the other hand, for 26% of cryptocurrencies, aging and growing market capitalization are both associated with a reduction in their power-law exponents, thus contributing to the rise in the frequency of large price variations in their dynamics. Only about 28% of cryptocurrencies present trends in which the power-law exponents increase with age and market capitalization, favoring thus large price variations to become less likely. These results somehow juxtapose with findings about the increasing informational efficiency of the cryptocurrency market . In fact, if on the one hand the cryptocurrency market is becoming more informationally efficient, then on the other our findings indicate that there is no clear trend toward decreasing the risks of sizable variations in the prices of most considered cryptoassets. In other words, risk and efficiency thus appear to be moving towards different directions in the cryptocurrency market. To conclude, we hope that our findings will contribute significantly to the better understanding of the dynamics of large price variations in the cryptocurrency market as a whole, and not just for a small subset of selected digital assets, which is especially relevant due to the diminishing concentration of market capitalization among the top digital currencies, and also because of the considerable impact these new assets may have in our increasingly digital economy."

      "Third, general archaeology journals (Antiquity, Journal of Field Archaeology, Oxford Journal of Archaeology, Journal of Anthropological Archaeology, Journal of World Prehistory). Finally, the broader cross-disciplinary journals PLoS One and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) were included. Published articles from the past ten years (2009\u20132018) have been analysed in order to assess the availability of plant macrofossil data. This ten-year period brackets the period where most archaeological journals have moved online and adopted supplementary materials. Data citation in synthetic studies has been assessed in the same range of publications. The extent of data reuse ranges from the analysis of whole sample data to the presence/absence of individual crops. The location of a data citation has been assessed in the same range of publications, with the addition of journals where occasional research incorporating archaeobotanical data is featured (Britannia, Journal of Archaeological Research, Ethnobiology Letters, Medieval Archaeology, Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society, World Archaeology). The underlying dataset for the analysis is available in Lodwick 2019. 4.1. Primary data sharing\nHere, the location of primary archaeobotanical data, that is sample level counts of macroscopic plant remains, was assessed for 239 journal articles across 16 journals (Lodwick 2019 Table 1). Figure 1 shows the results grouped by journal. Overall, only 56% of articles shared their primary data. In, Antiquity, JAS, JASR, PLOS One, Quaternary International and VHA, the highest proportion of publications did not include their primary data, that is to say that the sample-by-sample counts of plant macrofossils was not available. This level of data is comparable to the findings of other pilot studies in archaeology. Marwick and Pilaar Birch found a data sharing rate of 53% from 48 articles published in Journal of Archaeological Science in Feb \u2013 May 2017 (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018: 7), and confirm previous assertions that data is often withheld in archaeology (Kansa 2012: 499).",
      "A closely related issue is that of data reuse. Responsible reuse of primary data encourages the sharing of primary data (Atici et al. 2013), but levels of data reuse in archaeology are thought to remain low (Huggett 2018). Principles for responsible data citation in archaeology have recently been developed summarising how datasets should be cited (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018). In order to assess the current status of data sharing, citation and data re-use in archaeobotany, a review was undertaken of the publication of primary data and the publication of meta-analysis in major archaeological journals over the last ten years, building on recent pilot studies within archaeology (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018). The review of academic journals provided a contrast to recent assessments of archaeobotanical data deriving from developer-funded archaeology (Lodwick 2017c; Van der Veen, Hill & Livarda 2013). Journal articles have been selected as the focus of this study as the provision of online supplementary materials in the majority of journals and the ability to insert hyperlinks to persistent identifiers (eg a DOI) to link to datasets available elsewhere should not limit the publication of data and references. Much archaeobotanical data is also published elsewhere, especially from projects not based in the university sector, that is commercial or community archaeology in the UK. Archaeobotanical datasets emanating from this research are more commonly published through monographs, county journal articles, and unpublished (or grey literature) reports, but these are beyond the scope of the current review. All journal articles were included which represent the principle reporting of a new archaeobotanical assemblage. The selected journals fall within three groups. First, what is considered the specialist archaeobotanical journal (Vegetation History and Archaeobotany (VHA)). Second, archaeological science journals (Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, Environmental Archaeology, The Holocene, Journal of Archaeological Science (JAS), Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports (JASR), Journal of Ethnobiology, Quaternary International, Journal of Wetland Archaeology), which can be considered as specialist sub-disciplinary journals which should be maintaining data-quality."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "documentation": [
      "Specifically, we model the human's preference over different homotopy classes and leverage a conditional independence assumption to provide a tractable solution. In our approach, we assume that the human's inputs are noisily rational conditioned on both the goal and the preference. By jointly inferring the goal and path preference, we can avoid over-confidence in incorrect beliefs about the user's preferences, leading to improved system performance. We consider the problem of robot navigation in a known environment to an unknown destination, where a human can intervene and provide a heading direction to the robot using a joystick or force cues. The human also has a preference on which path the robot should take with respect to obstacles, and our objective is for the robot to understand the human's intentions and execute the task with minimal interventions. Let g be a discrete random variable denoting the goal of the task, belonging to a set of candidates \u2126 g , and let \u03b8 be a discrete-valued random variable representing the human's path preference, belonging to a set of possible preferences \u0398. The physical location of the robot at time index t is denoted by s t \u2208 R 2 , and the robot's action at time index t, belonging to some action space A, is denoted by a t . The transition model T (s t+1 | s t , a t ) is deterministic, meaning the robot has full control over its future location. At any time step, the human may provide an observation to the robot. When the human intervenes, the robot receives a direction (heading angle) that can be mapped to a future location in space. More specifically, we map the direction to an intended location, which is the resulting robot location after advancing in the indicated direction for one time step. For simplicity, we consider that the robot directly makes an observation o t of the location indicated by the human. We assume that the robot has a stochastic observation model for the human P (o t | s t , g, \u03b8) that is conditioned on both the goal of the task g and the human's preferred path \u03b8.",
      "Our solution is to encode path preference based on a partitioning of the environment into polytopes . This representation allows path preferences to be expressed as sets of preferred transitions between adjacent polytopes. Paths belonging to different homotopy classes correspond to different sequences of transitions. By leveraging conditional independence assumptions, we can make the Bayesian inference problem tractable. These assumptions exploit the fact that human actions provide information about the path in a piece-wise manner. For example, indicating a preference for navigating around a particular obstacle only provides information about the local area and not the entire path. Finally, after updating its belief representation over the human's preference, the robot can adapt to indications by replanning online. Our contributions are as follows. \u2022 We formulate the human-robot collaboration problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) where both the goal of the task and the human's path preference are unknown random variables. \u2022 We propose an encoding of a human's path preference using a partitioning of the environment into polytopes, along with conditional independence assumptions that make the Bayesian inference problem tractable to infer the task goal and path preference online. \u2022 Through simulations in two environments of different sizes and complexity, we show that our method is effective for solving problems where the robot must reach a goal that is unknown a-priori while simultaneously adapting to a human's indications. Our method shows higher success rates compared to baseline approaches when the human inputs are sparse. Our approach enables a robot to make effective navigation decisions in collaboration with a human, even when the goal and path preference are not known in advance, and with minimal human input. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in shared autonomy and interactive systems, where humans and robots work together to accomplish tasks."

      "The behavior of the inference quality in temperature and in the size of data samples is also investigated, basically confirming the low $T$ behavior hinted by Nguyen and Berg \\cite{Nguyen12b} for the Ising model. In temperature, in particular, the reconstruction error curve displays a minimum at a low temperature, close to the critical point in those cases in which a critical behavior occurs, and a sharp increase as temperature goes to zero. The decimation method, once again, appears to enhance this minimum of the reconstruction error of almost an order of magnitude with respect to other methods. The techniques displayed and the results obtained in this work can be of use in any of the many systems whose theoretical representation is given by Eq. \\eqref{eq:HXY} or Eq. \\eqref{eq:h_im}, some of which are recalled in Sec. \\ref{sec:model}. In particular, a possible application can be the field of light waves propagation through random media and the corresponding problem of the  reconstruction of an object seen through an opaque medium or a disordered optical fiber \\cite{Vellekoop07,Vellekoop08a,Vellekoop08b, Popoff10a,Akbulut11,Popoff11,Yilmaz13,Riboli14}.",

After a short review of techniques based on pseudo-likelihood and their formal generalization to the model we have tested their performances against data generated by means of Monte Carlo numerical simulations of known instances\nwith diluted, sparse, interactions. The main outcome is that the best performances are obtained by means of the  pseudo-likelihood method combined with decimation. Putting to zero (i.e., decimating) very weak bonds, this technique turns out to be very precise for  problems whose real underlying interaction network is sparse, i.e., the number of couplings per variable does not scale with number of variables. The PLM + decimation method is compared to the PLM + regularization method, with $\\ell_2$ regularization and to a mean-field-based method. The behavior of the quality of the network reconstruction is analyzed by looking at the overall sorted couplings and at the single site couplings, comparing them with the real network, and at the true positive curves in all three approaches. In the PLM +decimation method, moreover, the identification of the number of decimated bonds at which the tilted pseudo-likelihood is maximum allows for a precise estimate of the total number of bonds. Concerning this technique, it is also shown that the network with the most likely number of bonds is also the one of least reconstruction error, where not only the prediction of the presence of a bond is estimated but also its value."

A total of 229\nsource counts lie within a radius of 20\\arcsec, yielding a (EPIC-pn:\n0.2$-$2\\,keV) count rate of 23.4\\,ct s$^{-1}$. The source is seen to have no cross-correlation identifications in the\nRASS, and no other multiwavelength candidates within 30\\arcsec\\ in\nSimbad\\footnote{http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/},\nNED\\footnote{http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html}, and\nHEASARC\\footnote{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/}. The position of the\nsource in the sky is such that it lies apparently at the outer eastern\nedge of the LMC. XMM-Newton has slewed over this region of sky a number of times, and\nthough nothing was detected in previous slews from 7th November 2001\nand 12th January 2004, the source was seen again on 28th September\n2006 (rev.\\,1246, 72 days after the rev.\\,1210 discovery), at the same\nposition, but at a reduced flux level (3.8\\,ct s$^{-1}$; EPIC-pn:\n0.2$-$2\\,keV). i.e. it had reduced in flux by a factor of $\\approx$6\nin 72 days.

The soft band (0.2$-$2 keV) sensitivity limit of the slews\n(6$\\times10^{-13}$\\,ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) is close to that of the\nROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS; Voges et al.\\ 1999), and in the medium\n(2$-$12 keV) band, the slew data goes significantly deeper\n(4$\\times10^{-12}$\\,ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) than all other previous\nlarge area surveys. Over 7700 individual sources have so far been\ndetected to a positional accuracy of 8\\arcsec. For details on the\nthe construction and\ncharacteristics of the first released XMM-Newton slew survey\ncatalogue, see Saxton et al. (2008). For details of the initial\nscience results from the slew survey, see Read et al. (2006). The comparison of XMM-Newton slew data with the RASS is now giving,\nfor the first time, the opportunity to find exotic, extreme\nhigh-variability X-ray bursting objects, e.g. tidal disruption\ncandidates (Esquej et al. 2007), and also Galactic novae, flare stars,\nand flaring white dwarfs, plus eclipsing binaries, AGN and blazars. It\nis only with such a large-area survey as the XMM-Newton Slew Survey,\nthat transient events as these have a chance of being caught. One such rare event, XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933, which we here show to be\na new Classical Nova, was discovered in an XMM-Newton slew from 18th\nJuly 2006 at a very high count rate of 23.3\\,ct s$^{-1}$ (EPIC-pn:\n0.2$-$2\\,keV). Classical novae (see Bode \\& Evans 2008 for a review) occur in\ninteracting binary systems consisting of a white dwarf primary star\nand a lower-mass secondary star. The nova itself is a cataclysmic\nnuclear explosion caused by the accretion of material (via Roche Lobe\noverflow or wind accretion) from the secondary star onto the surface\nof the white dwarf; here the pressure and temperature at the base of\nthe accreted material becomes sufficient to trigger a thermonuclear\nrunaway. A recent review of the thermonuclear processes powering\nclassical novae can be found in Starrfield et al.\\ (2008)."

      "All phase-spaces were obtained by using a finite-difference operator on the data or predictions. These results are in accordance Interpretable reduced-order modeling with time-scale separation with whose LSTM-based temporal dynamic model was also able to find the correct phase space but not to track the actual dynamics for long-term predictions. Our model is not able to account for noise in the temporal evolution and thus dealing with chaotic, small-scale fluctuations is challenging. We believe that a probabilistic version of our algorithm could be advantageous here. This section contains a fully probabilistic formulation for the deterministic model discussed before. We replace the Autoencoder with a Variational Autoencoder and the ODE in the latent space with a SDE. The loss function which we optimize is the Evidence-Lower Bound (ELBO). Model Structure We postulate the following relations for our probabilistic model using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) for each dimension i of the latent space and a Wiener process W t in the latent space: We again assume that the latent variables z t are complex-valued and a priori independent. Complex variables were chosen as their evolution includes a harmonic components which are observed in many physical systems. We assume an initial conditions z 0,i \u223c CN (0, \u03c3 2 0,i ). The total parameters associated with the latent space dynamics of our model are thus {\u03c3 2 0,i , \u03c3 2 i , \u03bb i } c i=1 and will be denoted by \u03b8 together with all parameters responsible for the decoder mapping G (see next section). These parameters along with the state variables z t have to be inferred from the data x t . Based on probabilistic Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) , we set \u03c3 2 i = 2; (\u03bb j ) and \u03c3 2 0,i = 1. As a consequence, a priori, the latent dynamics are stationary. A derivation and reasoning for this choice can be found in Appendix A. Hence the only independent parameters are the \u03bb i , the imaginary part of which can account for periodic effects in the latent dynamics. Variational Autoencoder\n\nWe employ a variational autoencoder to account for a probabilistic mappings from the lower-dimensional representation z n to the high-dimensional system x n .",
      "The time-continuous formulation moreover allows to incorporate sparse and irregularly sampled training data and fast generation of predictions after the training phase. By using a complex-valued latent space we can also incorporate harmonic effects and reduce the number of latent variables needed. Linear and non-linear autoencoders are used to map the observed, high-dimensional time-series to the lower-dimensional, latent representation and we identify simultaneously the autoencoder as well as the latent dynamics by optimizing a combined loss function. Hence the to tasks of dimensionality reduction and discovery of the reduced dynamics are unified while other frameworks treat the two parts separately . Apart from using an architecture based on autoencoders to identify the latent space, projection-based methods could also be employed . We are also proposing a probabilistic version of our algorithm ) that makes use of probabilistic Slow Feature Analysis . This allows for a latent representation that arart from being time-continuous, can quantify the predictive uncertainty and hierarchically decompose the dynamics into their pertinent scales while promoting the discovery of slow processes that control the system's evolution over long time horizons. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: We introduce the methodological framework as well as algorithmic details in section II. Particular focus is paid on the interpretability of the inferred lower-dimensional dynamics. In section III we present three numerical illustrations, i.e. a system of linear ODEs, a hidden Markov Model and the discretized KS-equation. We then present in section IV the probabilistic extension of the framework and apply it to the KS-equation. We conclude with a summary and a short discussion about possible next steps. We introduce the autoencoders deployed in this work, followed by the interpretable latent space dynamic and discuss the training process. We consider data from high-dimensional time series x n \u2208 R f with n = 1, ..., T ."

The C$_2$H abundance is high toward the\ncore center right from the beginning of the evolution, similar to\nprevious models (e.g., \\citealt{millar1985,herbst1986,turner1999}). During the evolution, the C$_2$H abundance stays approximately\nconstant at the outer core edges, whereas it decreases by more than\nthree orders of magnitude in the center, except for the cold $T=10$~K\nmodel. The C$_2$H abundance profiles for all three models show\nsimilar behavior. The chemical evolution of ethynyl is determined by relative removal\nrates of carbon and oxygen atoms or ions into molecules like CO, OH,\nH$_2$O.

Since C$_2$H is the only exception in that rich\ndataset, chemical effects appear the more plausible explanation.

      "Compared to Hu et al. , which was regarded as an efficient tool to compute responses of linear systems, the generalized pole-residue method in this paper is introduced to compute responses of nonlinear systems. The proposed method involves two steps: (1) the Volterra kernels are decoupled in terms of Laguerre polynomials, and (2) the partial response related to a single Laguerre polynomial is obtained analytically in terms of the pole-residue method. Compared to the traditional pole-residue method for a linear system, one of the novelties of the generalized pole-residue method is how to deal with the higher-order poles and their corresponding coefficients. Similar to the Taylor series, the Volterra series representation is an infinite series, and convergence conditions are needed to assure that the representation is meaningful. Because the proposed method is based on the Volterra series, only the system with convergent Volterra series representation can be treated by the proposed method. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the nonlinear response is modelled by a Volterra series, and Volterra kernel functions are decoupled by Laguerre polynomials. Then, the pole-residue method for computing explicit responses is developed in Section 3. Numerical studies and discussions are given in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 5. Response calculation based on Volterra series\n\nA nonlinear oscillator, whose governing equation of motion is given by where z(t, y, \u1e8f) represents an arbitrary nonlinear term; m, c, and k are the mass, damping and linear stiffness, respectively; y(t), \u1e8f(t) and \u00ff(t) are the displacement, velocity and acceleration, respectively; and f (t) is the time-dependent excitation. If the energy of excitation f (t) is limited, the nonlinear response under zero initial conditions (i.e., zero displacement and zero velocity) can be represented by the Volterra series : where N is the order of Volterra series and In Eq. 3, h 1 (\u03c4 ) is called the first-order Volterra kernel function, which represents the linear behaviour of the system; h n (\u03c4 1 , . .",
      "When t becomes larger, both y s (t) and y c (t) diminish due to the presence of system damping, and the total response is entirely governed by y f (t). Moreover, we notice some features at t = 0 for these components, including y s (0) = \u2212y f (0) for the first-order response and y s (0) + y f (0) = \u2212y c (0) for the second-order response, which are due to imposed zero initial conditions. Conclusions\n\nConsidering arbitrary irregular excitations, an efficient generalized pole-residue method to compute the nonlinear dynamic response modelled by the Volterra series was developed. A core of the proposed method was obtaining poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions, then those of each order response modelled by each order Volterra series. Once the poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions and excitations were both available, the remaining derivation could follow a similar pole-residue method that had been developed for ordinary linear oscillators. To obtain the poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions, two steps were included: (1) using Laguerre polynomials to decouple higher-order Volterra kernel functions with respect to time and (2) obtaining poles and corresponding coefficients of Laguerre polynomials in the Laplace domain. Because the proposed method gave an explicit, continuous response function of time, it was much more efficient than traditional numerical methods. Moreover, many meaningful physical and mathematical insights were gained because not only each order response but also the natural response, the forced response and the cross response of each order were obtained in the solution procedure. To demonstrate that the proposed method was not only suitable for a system with a known equation of motion but also applicable to a system with an unknown equation of motion, two numerical studies were conducted. For each study, regular excitations and complex irregular excitations with different parameters were investigated.",

Numerical studies validate the good accuracy and high efficiency of the proposed method by comparing it with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Introduction\n\nMost real dynamic systems, as encountered in mechanical and civil engineering, are inherently nonlinear and include geometric nonlinearities, nonlinear constitutive relations in material or nonlinear resistances, etc. . Nonlinear problems are attracting increasing attention from engineers and scientists. This work focuses on solving nonlinear system vibration problems, i.e., computing transient responses of nonlinear oscillators under arbitrary irregular excitations based on a combination of a pole-residue operation and Volterra series. Because Volterra series are single-valued, the scope of the present study is restricted to nonlinear behaviours without bifurcations . To analyse nonlinear vibration problems, researchers have performed extensive studies and developed various mathematical methods. Popular methods include step-by-step numerical integration methods in the time domain, such as the Runge-Kutta method. This kind of method not only requires a small time-step resolution for obtaining high-precision solutions but also is prone to numerical instability ."

There is ample evidence in Franklin\u2019s correspondence and in a memoir by Polly Hewson (Mrs. Stevenson\u2019s daughter) that Benjamin and Mrs. Stevenson lived in not one, but two houses on Craven Street. On July 6, 1772, Polly wrote to Benjamin from her house at Broad Street North in London: \u201cMy Mother I must tell you went off last friday week, took our little Boy with her and left Mr. Hewson [Polly\u2019s husband, William] the care of her House [27 Craven Street]. The first thing he did was pulling down a part of it in order to turn it to his own purpose, and advantage we hope. This Demolition cannot affect you, who at present are not even a Lodger [Benjamin was traveling at the time], your litterary apartment remains untouch\u2019d, the Door is lock\u2019d \u2026\u201d[37] In a memoir about her husband written after his death Polly writes: \u201cHe [William Hewson] began his Lectures Sept. 30, 1772, in Craven-street, where he had built a Theatre adjoining a house which he intended for the future residence of his family.\u201d[38]",
      "For the most part they were. For example, Joseph Bond at No. 30, William Rowles at No. 31, Samuel Sneyd at No. 32, and Jonathan Michie at No. 35 in The London Directory coincide with their places of residence in the Westminster Rate Books; however, errors did occur. The 1776 edition of The London Directory lists Brown & Whiteford, wine merchants, at No. 9 Craven Street while the Westminster Rate Books list them as the twenty-ninth residents. Obviously, it makes no sense to have Brown & Whiteford at No. 9 in The London Directory and their next-door neighbor, Joseph Bond, at No. 30. The same error appears in Baldwin\u2019s The New Complete Guide for 1783. The New Complete Guide may have \u201cborrowed\u201d the error from The London Directory. It was not uncommon for the owner of one directory to copy entries from another to save both time and money. Beginning in 1778 and contrary to The London Directory, Kent\u2019s Directory faithfully followed the numbering system of the Westminster Rate Books in all of its editions and listed Brown & Whiteford at No. 29 as did Bailey\u2019s Northern Directory in 1781. Perhaps realizing their error, The London Directory changed their listing of Brown & Whiteford from No. 9 to No. 29 in their 1783 edition and maintained that listing thereafter. Sometime prior to 1792, the embankment on the Thames at the south end of Craven Street had been sufficiently extended allowing for the construction of ten new houses below the original houses: \u201c \u2026 four houses, Nos. 21\u201324, were built on the west side, and six houses, Nos. 25\u201330, on the east side of the way.\u201d[11] In a note in the same report, the new numbering system is explained. \u201cThe houses in the street, which had previously been numbered consecutively down the west side and up the east side, were then renumbered on the same system to include the additional houses.\u201d[12] Because the new houses (21-24) on the west side were built below the existing houses (1-20), houses 1-20 retained their original numbering. Figure 4. Craven Street 1799.",
      "Few of them were rated at more than a few shillings and many of them were unoccupied.\u201d[1] The landowner, William, 5th Baron Craven, desiring to increase the profitability of his assets, tore down the derelict structures on Spur Alley around 1730 and leased the newly established lots to builders. By 1735, twenty brick houses in the Georgian style had been built on the west side and sixteen on the east side of the way now called Craven Street.[2] Figure 2. Craven Street 1746. (John Rocque London, Westminster and Southwark, First Edition 1746, Motco Enterprises Limited, motco.com)\nLetters to Franklin during his residence with Mrs. Margaret Stevenson, his landlady on Craven Street, were addressed rather vaguely; \u201cCraven Street/Strand\u201d, \u201cMrs. Stevensons in Craven Street\u201d, or \u201cBenjamin Franklin Esqr.\u201d are but a few examples. Letters from Franklin referenced \u201cLondon,\u201d or sometimes \u201cCravenstreet,\u201d but never included a number. Despite the absence of numbered addresses in Franklin\u2019s correspondence, there was a sense of one\u2019s place in the neighborhood based on entries in the Westminster Rate Books (tax assessments). The Rate Books did not list house numbers during Franklin\u2019s time there, but they did list the residents of Craven Street in a particular order that became the default numbering system for the street. Number one was associated with the first resident listed under \u201cCraven Street\u201d in the Rate Books and was the northernmost house on the west side of the street. The numbers increased counter-clockwise down the west side and up the east side in accordance with the list of residents. In 1748, the first year of Margaret Stevenson\u2019s (Stevens in the Rate Books for that year) residence on Craven Street, she is listed as the twenty-seventh resident, the second house north of Court Street (later Craven Court, now Craven Passage) on the east side of the street.[3]\nIn 1766, Parliament passed the London Paving and Lighting Act (6 Geo. 3 c. 26), \u201cAn act for the better paving, cleansing, and enlightening, the city of London, and the liberties thereof; and for preventing obstructions and annoyances within the same; and for other purposes therein mentioned."

      "How Oxycontin, Florida and the Sackler Family Created the Opioid Crisis In America\nWhy are the Sacklers worth $13 billion today? Answer: \u201cThe Oxy Express Explained\u201d\n(MASS TORT NEXUS MEDIA)\nA COMPARISON OF OXYCODONE PRESCRIBING\nIn the first six months of 2010, Ohio doctors and health care practitioners bought the second-largest number of oxycodone doses in the country at just under 1 million pills. Florida doctors bought 40.8 million in the same period, the comparison is astounding, yet it flew under the DEA, Opioid Big Pharma and everyone elses radar for years and years. Of the country\u2019s top 50 oxycodone-dispensing clinics, 49 were in Florida. From August 2008 to November 2009, a new pain clinic opened in Broward and Palm Beach counties on average of every three days. Pharmacies and distributors are at fault as well, pharmacies ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from opioid drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies. 90 of 100 of the nation\u2019s top 100 oxy-buying doctors in 2010, were in Florida. 49 of 50 of the country\u2019s top oxy-dispensing clinics were in Florida. For some reason this didn\u2019t raise an alarm or cause anyone to look further at the time. Purdue Pharma New What Was Happening In Florida\nPurdue and the Sacklers chose to ignore Florida, because apparently nobody there sued them or complained. In 2007, in other states, the infamous drug maker and three of its executives pled guilty in federal court and paid out $634.5 million in fines for purposefully misleading regulators, doctors, and patients about the addictiveness of their opioid painkiller. Around the same time, Purdue was also sued by several states, including Washington, over similar allegations. Purdue agreed to a $19.5 million multi-state settlement. And in 2015, Purdue settled a case with Kentucky, agreeing to pay $24 million. As part of the state settlements, Purdue was supposed to set up monitoring programs to make sure that its opioid drug didn\u2019t wind up in the wrong hands. It was supposed to watch out for shady pharmacies, unusually large orders, or suspiciously frequent orders.",
      "But on this front, Everett alleges that Purdue once again put profits over people. Obviously, this was ignored as the Florida based \u201cOxy Expres\u201d; rolled on for years and years with np input, comment or oversight by Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family other than \u201cshow me the money\u201d and enjoying a life of luxury on the misery created and managed in the Purdue Pharma boardroom. But, the Purdue boardroom isn\u2019t the only guilty \u201cOpioid Big Pharma\u201d industry player who designed and supported the opioid prescribing crisis. For the current status of efforts to make Opioid Big Pharma accept responsibility in litigation filed in federal and state courts across the country, see: https://www.masstortnexus.com/Briefcases/254/OPIOID-CRISIS-BRIEFCASE-INCLUDING-MDL-2804-OPIATE-PRESCRIPTION-LITIGATION\nWhy Distributors Are Liable\nCardinal Health, one of the nation\u2019s biggest distributors, sold two CVS pharmacies in Sanford a combined 3 million doses of oxycodone, flooding the town of 54,000 with an average of 250,000 oxycodone pills every month. West of Jupiter, a Walgreens drug distribution center sold 2.2 million tablets to a single Walgreens\u2019 pharmacy in tiny Hudson, a roughly six-month supply for each of its 12,000 residents. It shipped more than 1.1 million pills to each of two Fort Pierce Walgreens pharmacies. For 40 days starting in late 2010, the distribution center shipped 3,271 bottles of oxycodone \u2014 327,100 doses of the drug \u2014 to a Port Richey Walgreens pharmacy, prompting a distribution manager to ask: \u201cHow can they even house this many bottles?\u201d There were 53 million oxycodone prescriptions filled in 2013 by US pharmacies, according to NIDA. This translates to approximately one bottle of this addictive drug for every 6 people in the country. How was this not noticed by those responsible for monitoring narcotics prescribing in the United States?

      "A Palm Bay man\u2019s Puerto Rican family bought local pills destined for the working class town of Holyoke, Mass. In Rhode Island, police pulled over a Lauderhill man caught speeding through Providence. They found 903 oxycodone tablets and 56 morphine pills in the car. Senior citizen and Tulane business graduate Joel Shumrak funneled more than 1 million pills into eastern Kentucky from his South Florida and Georgia clinics, much of it headed for street sales \u2014 an estimated 20 percent of the illicit oxycodone in the entire state. Van loads of pill-seekers organized by \u201cVIP buyers\u201d traveled from Columbus, Ohio, to three Jacksonville clinics, where armed guards handled crowd control (federal indictment) and doctors generated prescriptions totaling 3.2 million pills in six months. In Miami, Vinny Colangelo created 1,500 internet website names to entice drug users throughout the nation to one of his six South Florida pain clinics or pharmacies. Even the Mafia got in on the Florida oxy express action: A Bonanno crime family associate oversaw a local crew stocking up on Palm Beach and Broward pain clinic oxycodone, upstreaming profits to the New York family. At times, it seemed almost no section of the country was free of Florida-supplied pills: When Olubenga Badamosi was arrested driving his Bentley Continental in Miami in 2011, the Oregon man was one of two traffickers overseeing a crew smuggling South Florida oxycodone to sell in Salt Lake City, Seattle and Denver as well as Oregon, Nevada, Texas and even Alaska. Pharmacy delivers oxy \u2018pot of gold\u2019\nIt would be hard to overstate Florida\u2019s role in feeding the country\u2019s voracious appetite for oxycodone. Oxycodone 30-milligram tablets were favored by addicts. And in 2009 and 2010, roughly four of every 10 of those pills were sold in Florida. Small wonder: Of the nation\u2019s top 100 oxycodone-buying doctors, 90 were in Florida. Pharmacies, too, ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies."

Then, the identity implies F Z,Z (x, y) \u2212 \u03a6(x)\u03a6(y) \u2265 0 for all x, y \u2208 R \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c1 \u2265 0, (see . Since Cov( Qk , Ql ) \u2265 0 and the ratio of two densities is non-negative, x = \u2212 2/m, it follows that f Q(x) is monotone decreasing for x \u2265 \u2212 2/m. Furthermore, F Q(\u2212 m/2) \u2264 0.5 for all m \u2208 N as f Q(x) is right-skewed. In particular, \u2212 m/2 \u2264 F \u22121 Q (1/2) for all m \u2208 N. Finally, since f Q(\u2212 2/m) \u2192 \u03c6(0) for m \u2192 \u221e there is a constant c > 0 not depending on m such that\nThe simulation study in Section 5 is performed in the same way, but with the uniform and the gamma distribution instead of the Gaussian distribution.",
      "In the next paragraph, we derive the asymptotic order of E[exp{\u03bb H(f ) \u221e }] for n, p \u2192 \u221e, where \u03bb > 0 may depend on n, p or not. By the exponential decay property of the kernel K stated in Lemma 2 holds First, H(f ) \u221e is bounded with the maximum over a finite number of points. Calculating the derivative of s : Since \u03b4 \u03b4x s(x) > 0 almost surely for x = x k , the extrema occur at x k , k = 1, ..., T . Thus, for \u03bb > 0 the moment generating function of H(f ) \u221e is bounded by\nLet M j = ( T h) \u22121 T k=1 \u03b3 h (x j , x k ), which by Lemma 2 is bounded uniformly in j by some global constant M > 0. By the convexity of the exponential function we obtain \u221a 2 and by assumption 0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 f \u2264 M 0 . Using Lemma 3, Q k can be written as a sum of m = np/T independent gamma random variables, i.e.\nThe moment generating function of | log(X)| when X follows a \u0393(a, b)-distribution is given by where \u0393(a) is the gamma function and \u03b3(a, b) is the lower incomplete gamma function. In particular, To derive the asymptotic order of E[exp{\u03bb H(f ) \u221e }] for n, p \u2192 \u221e we first establish the asymptotic order of the ratio \u0393(a + t)/\u0393(a) for a \u2192 \u221e.\nWe distinguish the two cases where t is independent of a and where t linearly depends on a. Thus, for 0 < t < a and t independent of a, equation (A.17) implies for a \u2192 \u221e that \u0393(a + t)/\u0393(a) = O(a t ). Similarly, it can be seen that \u0393(a \u2212 t)/\u0393(a) = O(a \u2212t ). If 0 < t < a and t linearly depends on a, i.e. t = ca for some constant c \u2208 (0, 1), then we get \u0393(a \u00b1 t)/\u0393(a) = O(a \u00b1t exp{a}) for a \u2192 \u221e.\nHence, for a fixed \u03bb not depending on n, p and such that 0 < \u03bb < m/( \u221a 2M j ) we get for sufficiently large n, p If \u03bb = cm such that 0 < \u03bb < m/( \u221a 2M j ), then for sufficiently large n, p b\u2208{c\u03b4/m,cM 0 /m} (bm/2) for some constant L > 1. Set K = min j=1,..., T 1/( \u221a 2M j ) which is a constant independent of n, p. Altogether, we showed that for 0 < \u03bb < Km and n, p \u2192 \u221e\nBounding the right hand side of (A.15) for some constants c 0 , c 1 > 0 and n, p \u2192 \u221e Since g lies between H(f ) and H(f ), and f almost surely pointwise.",
      "Finally, we prove the second statement on the precision matrices. For the sake of clarity, some technical lemmas used in the proof are listed separately in A.4. hT \u2192 \u221e, then with T = p \u03c5 for any \u03c5 \u2208 ((4 \u2212 2 min{1, \u03b2})/3, 1), the estimator H(f ) described in Section 3 with q = max{1, \u03b3} satisfies\nProof : Application of the triangle inequality yields a bias-variance decomposition Set T = 2T \u2212 2 and x k = (k \u2212 1)/ T for k = 1, ..., T . Using Lemma 4, we can write where Mirroring and renumerating \u03b6 k , \u03b7 k , k is similar as for Y * k , k = 1, ..., T . Using the above representation, one can write First we reduce the supremum to a maximum over a finite number of points. If q > 1, then W (\u2022, x k ) is Lipschitz continuous with constant L > 0. In this case, it holds almost surely that sup ) is a piecewise linear function with knots at x j = j/ T . The factor (\u03b6 k + \u03be k ) can be considered as stochastic weights that do not affect the piecewise linear property. Thus, the supremum is attained at one of the knots x j = j/ T , j = 1, ..., T , and (A.7) is also valid for q = 1. Again with (a + b) 2 \u2264 2a 2 + 2b 2 we obtain We start with bounding . This requires a bound on 1 \u2022 \u03c8 2 denotes the sub-Gaussian norm. In case of a Gaussian random variable the norm equals to the variance. Thus with Lemma 2 and Lemma 4, we obtain Lemma 1.6 of ) then yields Recall that T = p \u03c5 for some fixed \u03c5 \u2208 ((4 \u2212 2 min{1, \u03b2})/3, 1). Using the inequality log(x) \u2264 x a /a one can find constants x \u03c5 , C \u03c5 > 0 depending on \u03c5 but not on n, p such that log(2 T ) log(p) Next, we derive a bound for the second term The exponential decay property of the kernel K stated in Lemma 2 yields The first term in (A.9) can be bounded again with Lemma 1.6 of . We use the fact that for not necessarily independent random variables X 1 , ..., X N R and R > 0 are constants. This is a consequence of Lemma 1 of which yields , it follows that N i=1 a i X i has a subGaussain distribution and the subGaussian norm is bounded by 2R( N i=1 a 2 i ) 1/2 . See for further details on the subgaussian distribution."

      "Cardioversion \u2013 A medical procedure in which an abnormally fast heart rate (tachycardia) or cardiac arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation is converted to a normal rhythm using electricity or drugs. Synchronized electrical cardioversion uses a therapeutic dose of electric current to the heart at a specific moment in the cardiac cycle. Chemical cardioversion uses medications to convert to normal rhythm. Cath lab \u2013 the room in the hospital/medical clinic where cardiac catheterization procedures take place (for example, when a stent is implanted into a blocked coronary artery). CCB \u2013 Calcium Channel Blocker: A drug that lowers blood pressure by regulating calcium-related electrical activity in the heart. CDS \u2013 Cardiac Depression Scale: A scale that can help assess the effects of depression occurring as a result of a heart disease diagnosis. CHF \u2013 Heart Failure (also called Congestive Heart Failure): A condition in which the heart cannot pump all the blood returning to it, leading to a backup of blood in the vessels and an accumulation of fluid in the body\u2019s tissues, including the lungs.\nCM \u2013 Cardiomyopathy: A disease of the heart muscle that leads to generalized deterioration of the muscle and its pumping ability. CO \u2013 Cardiac Output: The amount of blood the heart pumps through the circulatory system in one minute. Collateral arteries \u2013 These extra coronary blood vessels are sometimes able to bypass a blockage in an artery in order to supply enough oxygenated blood to enable the heart muscle to survive when in danger of being damaged because of blockage(s). Collateral arteries \u2013 Blood vessels that provide an alternative arterial supply of blood to an area of the heart that\u2019s in danger of being deprived of oxygenated blood because of one or more blocked arteries. Congenital heart defect \u2013 one of about 35 different types of heart conditions that happen when the heart or the blood vessels near the heart don\u2019t develop normally before a baby is born (in about 1% of live births). Because of medical advances that treat babies born with heart defects, there are now for the first time more adults with congenital heart disease than children.",
      "Endothelium: A single-cell layer of flat endothelial cells lining the closed internal spaces of the body such as the inside of blood vessels. Endothelial dysfunction affects the ability of these cells to help dilate blood vessels, control inflammation or prevent blood clots. The endothelium is associated with most forms of cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney failure, and severe viral infections. Enhanced External Counterpulsation \u2013 EECP is an FDA-approved non-invasive, non-drug treatment for angina. It works by promoting the development of collateral coronary arteries. The therapy is widely used in prominent heart clinics such as the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins \u2013 especially for patients who are not good candidates for invasive procedures such as bypass surgery, angioplasty or stenting. EP \u2013 Electrophysiologist: A cardiologist who has additional training in diagnosing/treating heart rhythm disorders. EPS \u2013 Electrophysiology Study: A test that uses cardiac catheterization to study patients who have arrhythmias (abnormal hear rhythm). An electrical current stimulates the heart in an effort to provoke an arrhythmia, which is immediately treated with medications. EPS is used primarily to identify the origin of the arrhythmia and to test the effectiveness of medications used to treat abnormal heart rhythms. EVH \u2013 Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting: To create the bypass graft during CABG open heart surgery, a surgeon will remove or \u201charvest\u201d healthy blood vessels from another part of the body, often from the patient\u2019s leg or arm. This vessel becomes a graft, with one end attaching to a blood source above and the other end below the blocked area. See CABG. Exercise stress test \u2013 An exercise test (walking/running on a treadmill or pedalling a stationary bike) to make your heart work harder and beat faster. An EKG is recorded while you exercise to monitor any abnormal changes in your heart under stress, with or without the aid of drugs to enhance this assessment.",
      "Also called coronary artery disease and coronary heart disease. INR \u2013 International Normalized Ratio: A laboratory test measure of blood coagulation, often used as a standard for monitoring the effects of the anti-coagulant drug, warfarin (coumadin). IST \u2013 Inappropriate sinus tachycardia: A heart condition seen most often in young women, in which a person\u2019s resting heart rate is abnormally high (greater than 100 bpm), their heart rate increases rapidly with minimal exertion, and this rapid heart rate is accompanied by symptoms of palpitations, fatigue, and/or exercise intolerance. Interventional cardiologist \u2013 A cardiologist who is trained to perform invasive heart procedures like angiography, angioplasty, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), implanting stents, etc. IVS \u2013 Interventricular Septum: The stout wall that separates the lower chambers (the ventricles) of the heart from one another. IVUS \u2013 Intravascular Ultrasound: A form of echocardiography performed during cardiac catheterization in which a transducer (a device that can act as a transmitter (sender) and receiver of ultrasound information) is threaded into the heart blood vessels via a catheter; it\u2019s used to provide detailed information about the blockage inside the blood vessels. LAD \u2013 Left Anterior Descending coronary artery: One of the heart\u2019s coronary artery branches from the left main coronary artery which supplies blood to the left ventricle. LAFB \u2013 Left Anterior Fascicular Block: A cardiac condition,distinguished from Left Bundle Branch Block because only the anterior half of the left bundle branch is defective and more common than left posterior fascicular block. LAHB \u2013 Left Anterior Hemiblock: The Left Bundle Branch divides into two major branches \u2013 the anterior and the posterior fascicles. Occasionally, a block can occur in one of these fascicles. Left Circumflex Artery \u2013 The artery carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the body; it\u2019s a branch of the Left Main Coronary Artery after the latter runs its course in between the aorta and the Main Pulmonary Artery.

      "Thalassaemia minor | definition of Thalassaemia minor by Medical dictionary\nThalassaemia minor | definition of Thalassaemia minor by Medical dictionary\nhttps://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Thalassaemia+minor\n(redirected from Thalassaemia minor)\nRelated to Thalassaemia minor: thalassaemia major\nThalassemia describes a group of inherited disorders characterized by reduced or absent amounts of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein inside the red blood cells. There are two basic groups of thalassemia disorders: alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia. These conditions cause varying degrees of anemia, which can range from insignificant to life threatening. All types of thalassemias are considered quantitative diseases of hemoglobin, because the quantity of hemoglobin produced is reduced or absent. Usual adult hemoglobin is made up of three components: alpha globin, beta globin, and heme. Thalassemias are classified according to the globin that is affected, hence the names alpha and beta thalassemia. Although both classes of thalassemia affect the same protein, the alpha and beta thalassemias are distinct diseases that affect the body in different ways. Beta thalassemia may be the most best-known type of thalassemia and is also called Cooley's anemia. It is caused by a change in the gene for the beta globin component of hemoglobin. Beta thalassemia causes variable anemia that can range from moderate to severe, depending in part on the exact genetic change underlying the disease. Beta thalassemia can be classified based on clinical symptoms. Beta thalassemia major usually causes severe anemia that can occur within months after birth. If left untreated, severe anemia can result in insufficient growth and development, as well as other common physical complications that can lead to a dramatically decreased life-expectancy. Fortunately, in developed countries beta thalassemia is usually identified by screening in the newborn period, before symptoms have developed. Children who are identified early can be started on ongoing blood transfusion therapy as needed.",

      "Scientists continue to study the causes. For instance, a new mutation for alpha-thalassemia was discovered for the first time among Iranian patients in 2004. BETA-THALASSEMIA. Most individuals have two normal copies of the beta globin gene, which is located on chromosome 11 and makes the beta globin component of normal adult hemoglobin, hemoglobin A. There are approximately 100 genetic mutations that have been described that cause beta thalassemia, designated as either beta0 or beta + mutations. No beta globin is produced with a beta0 mutation, and only a small fraction of the normal amount of beta globin is produced with a beta + mutation. When an individual has one normal beta globin gene and one with a beta thalassemia mutation, he or she is said to carry the beta thalassemia trait. Beta thalassemia trait, like other hemoglobin traits, is protective against malaria infection. Trait status is generally thought not to cause health problems, although some women with beta thalassemia trait may have an increased tendency toward anemia during pregnancy. When two members of a couple carry the beta thalassemia trait, there is a 25% chance that each of their children will inherit beta thalassemia disease by inheriting two beta thalassemia mutations, one from each parent. The clinical severity of the beta thalassemia disease\u2014whether an individual has beta thalassemia intermedia or beta thalassemia major\u2014will depend largely on whether the mutations inherited are beta0 thalassemia or beta + thalassemia mutations. Two beta0 mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia major, and two beta+ thalassemia mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia intermedia. Inheritance of one beta0 and one beta + thalassemia mutation tends to be less predictable. Although relatively uncommon, there are other thalassemia-like mutations that can affect the beta globin gene. Hemoglobin E is the result of a substitution of a single nucleotide. This change results in a structurally altered hemoglobin that is produced in decreased amounts."

Indeed, let us consider the function\n\\begin{equation*}\ng\\left(x\\right) = {\\sqrt[3]{x}}\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}\n\\end{equation*}\nand its derivative $g'\\left(x\\right)$ \n\\begin{equation*}\ng'\\left(x\\right) = \\frac{\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}-6x^2\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nSimilar to the previous example, the expression for the derivative is undefined at $x=0$. Nonetheless, it can be shown that $g\\left(x\\right)$ is not differentiable at $x=0$ (see Figure \\ref{fig:GFunction}). Therefore, we provided two visually similar functions: both have the expressions for their derivatives undefined in zero, however, one of these functions possesses a derivative, but the other one does not.\n\n\\section{Methodological Remarks} Unfortunately, there exist many functions similar to the ones discussed above and they can arise in a variety of typical Calculus problems: finding the points where the tangent line is horizontal, finding an equation of the tangent and normal lines to the curve at the given point, the use of differentials and graph sketching. Relying only on the expression of the derivative for determining its value at the undefined points may lead to missing a solution (as in the example discussed above) or to some completely false interpretations (as in the case of curve sketching). As it was discussed above, the expression for the derivative does not provide any information on the existence or the value of the derivative, where the expression itself is undefined. Here we present a methodology for the analysis of this type of functions. Let $f\\left(x\\right)$ be the function of interest and $f'\\left(x\\right)$ be the expression of its derivative undefined at some point $x_{0}$.",
      "Students are expected to develop a skill of deriving similar results and know how to find the derivative of the function using definition of the derivative only. But how `legal' are the performed operations?\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\begin{center}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=6.0in]{sin.pdf}\n\t\\vspace{.1in}\n\t\\caption{Graph of the function $g\\left(x\\right)=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}$}\n\t\\label{fig: GFunction}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nLet us consider each of the following limits: \n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{x+h}-\\sqrt[3]{x}}{h}} \\notag \\\\\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}\\notag \\\\\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sin{\\left(x+h\\right)^2}-\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{h}}\\notag \\\\\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\sqrt[3]{x+h}}. \\end{eqnarray*}\nThe last three limits exist for all real values of the variable $x$. However, the first limit does not exist when $x=0$. Indeed\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{0+h}-\\sqrt[3]{0}}{h}} = \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{h^2}}} = + \\infty\n\\end{equation*}\n\nThis implies that the Product and Sum Laws for limits cannot be applied and therefore this step is not justifiable in the case of $x=0$. When the derivation is performed, we automatically assume the conditions, under which the Product Law for limits can be applied, i.e. that both limits that are multiplied exist. It is not hard to see that in our case these conditions are actually equivalent to $x\\neq0$. This is precisely why, when we wrote out the expression for the derivative (\\ref{DerivativeExpression}), it already contained the assumption that it is only true for the values of $x$ that are different from zero. Note, that in the case of $x=0$ the application of the Product and Sum Laws for limits is not necessary, since the term $\\left(\\sqrt[3]{x+h}-\\sqrt[3]{x}\\right)\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}$ vanishes. The correct expression for the derivative of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ should be the following:\n\\begin{equation*}\nf'\\left(x\\right)  = \n\\begin{cases} \n\\frac{6x^2\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}+\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}}, & \\mbox{if }",
      "In order to find out if $f\\left(x\\right)$ is differentiable at $x_{0}$, we suggest to follow a list of steps:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item Check if the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ itself is defined at the point $x_{0}$. If $f\\left(x\\right)$ is undefined at $x_{0}$, then it is not differentiable at $x_{0}$. If $f\\left(x\\right)$ is defined at $x_{0}$, then proceed to next step. \\item Identify the basic functions that are used in the formula of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$, that are themselves defined at the point $x_{0}$, but their derivative is not (such as, for example, the root functions). \\item Find the derivative of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ at the point $x_{0}$ using definition. \\end{enumerate}\n\nThe importance of the first step comes from the fact that most students tend to pay little attention to the functions domain analysis when asked to investigate its derivative. Formally, the second step can be skipped, however it will give the students the insight into which part of the function presents a problem and teach them to identify similar cases in the future. the difficulty of accomplishing the third step depends on the form of the function and sometimes can be tedious. Nevertheless, it allows the students to apply the previously obtained skills and encourages the review of the material.\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\begin{center}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=6.0in]{cos.pdf}\n\t\\vspace{.1in}\n\t\\caption{Graph of the function $g\\left(x\\right)=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}$}\n\t\\label{fig:GFunction}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe discussed the misconception, that the expression of the derivative of the function contains the information as to whether the function is differentiable or not at the points, where the expression is undefined. We considered a typical Calculus problem of looking for the horizontal tangent line of a function as an example. We showed how the search for the values that make the expression of the derivative equal zero leads to missing a solution: even though the expression of the derivative is undefined, the function still possesses the derivative at the point."

      "First, note that the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ is defined in $x=0$. In order to verify if it has a horizontal tangent at this point, let us find the derivative of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ using definition:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nf'\\left(0\\right) &=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{f\\left(0+h\\right)-f\\left(0\\right)}{h}} \\notag \\\\ \n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{h}\\sin{\\left(h^2\\right)}}{h}} \\notag \\\\ \n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\left(\\sqrt[3]{h} \\cdot {h} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin{\\left(h^2\\right)}}{h^2}\\right)} \\notag \\\\\n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\sqrt[3]{h}} \\cdot \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{h} \\cdot \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sin{\\left(h^2\\right)}}{h^2}} \\notag \\\\\n&=& 0 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 1 = 0 \\notag\n\\end{eqnarray}\nsince each of the limits above exists. We see that, indeed, the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ possesses a horizontal tangent line at the point $x=0$.\n\n\\section{Closer Look at the Expression for the Derivative}\n\nWhat is the problem with the standard procedure proposed by many textbooks and repeated in every Calculus class? The explanation lies in the following premise: the expression of the derivative of the function does not contain the information as to whether the function is differentiable or not at the points where it is undefined. As it is pointed out in \\cite{Rivera2013}, the domain of the derivative is determined \\emph{a priori} and therefore should not be obtained from the formula of the derivative itself. In the example above the Product Law for derivatives requires the existence of the derivatives of both functions at the point of interest. Since the function $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ is not differentiable in zero, the Product Rule cannot be applied. In order to see what exactly happens when we apply the Product Rule, let us find the expression for the derivative using definition of the derivative:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nf'\\left(x\\right) &=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{f\\left(x+h\\right)-f\\left(x\\right)}{h}} \\notag \\\\ \n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{x+h}\\sin{\\left(x+h\\right)^2}-\\sqrt[3]{x}\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{h}} \\notag \\\\ \n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\left(\\sqrt[3]{x+h}-\\sqrt[3]{x}\\right)}{h}\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}} + \\notag \\\\\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\left(\\sin{\\left(x+h\\right)^2}-\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}\\right)}{h}\\sqrt[3]{x+h}} \\notag \\\\\n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{x+h}-\\sqrt[3]{x}}{h}} \\cdot \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}} +  \\notag \\\\&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sin{\\left(x+h\\right)^2}-\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{h}} \\cdot \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\sqrt[3]{x+h}} \\notag \\\\\n&=& \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}} \\cdot \\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}+2x\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{x} \\notag \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhich seems to be identical to the expression (\\ref{DerivativeExpression}).",
      "In order to find out if $f\\left(x\\right)$ is differentiable at $x_{0}$, we suggest to follow a list of steps:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item Check if the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ itself is defined at the point $x_{0}$. If $f\\left(x\\right)$ is undefined at $x_{0}$, then it is not differentiable at $x_{0}$. If $f\\left(x\\right)$ is defined at $x_{0}$, then proceed to next step. \\item Identify the basic functions that are used in the formula of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$, that are themselves defined at the point $x_{0}$, but their derivative is not (such as, for example, the root functions). \\item Find the derivative of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ at the point $x_{0}$ using definition. \\end{enumerate}\n\nThe importance of the first step comes from the fact that most students tend to pay little attention to the functions domain analysis when asked to investigate its derivative. Formally, the second step can be skipped, however it will give the students the insight into which part of the function presents a problem and teach them to identify similar cases in the future. the difficulty of accomplishing the third step depends on the form of the function and sometimes can be tedious. Nevertheless, it allows the students to apply the previously obtained skills and encourages the review of the material.\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\begin{center}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=6.0in]{cos.pdf}\n\t\\vspace{.1in}\n\t\\caption{Graph of the function $g\\left(x\\right)=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}$}\n\t\\label{fig:GFunction}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe discussed the misconception, that the expression of the derivative of the function contains the information as to whether the function is differentiable or not at the points, where the expression is undefined. We considered a typical Calculus problem of looking for the horizontal tangent line of a function as an example. We showed how the search for the values that make the expression of the derivative equal zero leads to missing a solution: even though the expression of the derivative is undefined, the function still possesses the derivative at the point.",
      "Students are expected to develop a skill of deriving similar results and know how to find the derivative of the function using definition of the derivative only. But how `legal' are the performed operations?\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\begin{center}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=6.0in]{sin.pdf}\n\t\\vspace{.1in}\n\t\\caption{Graph of the function $g\\left(x\\right)=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}$}\n\t\\label{fig: GFunction}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nLet us consider each of the following limits: \n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{x+h}-\\sqrt[3]{x}}{h}} \\notag \\\\\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}\\notag \\\\\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sin{\\left(x+h\\right)^2}-\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{h}}\\notag \\\\\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\sqrt[3]{x+h}}. \\end{eqnarray*}\nThe last three limits exist for all real values of the variable $x$. However, the first limit does not exist when $x=0$. Indeed\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{0+h}-\\sqrt[3]{0}}{h}} = \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{h^2}}} = + \\infty\n\\end{equation*}\n\nThis implies that the Product and Sum Laws for limits cannot be applied and therefore this step is not justifiable in the case of $x=0$. When the derivation is performed, we automatically assume the conditions, under which the Product Law for limits can be applied, i.e. that both limits that are multiplied exist. It is not hard to see that in our case these conditions are actually equivalent to $x\\neq0$. This is precisely why, when we wrote out the expression for the derivative (\\ref{DerivativeExpression}), it already contained the assumption that it is only true for the values of $x$ that are different from zero. Note, that in the case of $x=0$ the application of the Product and Sum Laws for limits is not necessary, since the term $\\left(\\sqrt[3]{x+h}-\\sqrt[3]{x}\\right)\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}$ vanishes. The correct expression for the derivative of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ should be the following:\n\\begin{equation*}\nf'\\left(x\\right)  = \n\\begin{cases} \n\\frac{6x^2\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}+\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}}, & \\mbox{if }"

      "After sampling the entire price return series, we obtain time series for the power-law exponents (\u03b1 t ) associated with positive and negative returns as well as the corresponding p-values time series for each step t of the expanding time window. These time series allow us to reconstruct the aging process of the return distributions over the entire history of each cryptoasset and probe possible time-dependent patterns. Figures ) and 1(d) show the power-law exponents and p-values time series for the case of Bitcoin. The power-law hypothesis is never rejected for positive returns and rarely rejected for negative returns (about 4% of times). Moreover, the power-law exponents exhibit large fluctuations at the beginning of the time series and become more stable as Bitcoin matures as a financial asset (a similar tendency as reported by Begu\u0161i\u0107 et al. ). The time evolution of these exponents further shows that the asymmetry between positive and negative returns observed in Fig. ) is not an incidental feature of a particular moment in Bitcoin's history. Indeed, the power-law exponent for positive returns is almost always larger than the exponent for negative returns, implying that large negative price returns have been more likely to occur than their positive counterparts over nearly the entire history of Bitcoin covered by our data. However, while the difference between positive and negative exponents has approached a constant value, both exponents exhibit an increasing trend, indicating that large price variations are becoming less frequent with the coming-of-age of Bitcoin. The previous analysis motivates us to ask whether the entire cryptocurrency market behaves similarly to Bitcoin and what other common patterns digital currencies tend to follow. To start answering this question, we have considered the p-values series of all cryptocurrencies to verify if the power-law hypothesis holds in general. Figure (a) shows the percentage of cryptoassets rejecting the power-law hypothesis in at most a given fraction of the weekly positions of the expanding time window ( f r ).",
      "Panels (c) and (d) show the distributions of these median exponents when considering the top 2000 and the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, respectively. We observe that the distributions of \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 tend to shift toward larger values when considering the largest cryptoassets. number of return observations (between 100 and 300 days) and filtering out cryptoassets with missing observations (Supplementary Figures ). Still, it is worth noticing the existence of a few cryptoassets (9 of them) with relatively small market capitalization (ranking below the top 1000) for which the power-law hypothesis is always rejected (Supplementary Table ). Having verified that large price movements in the cryptocurrency market are generally well-described by powerlaw distributions, we now focus on the power-law exponents that typically characterize each cryptoasset. To do so, we select all exponent estimates over the entire history of each digital asset for which the power-law hypothesis is not rejected and calculate their median values for both the positive ( \u03b1+ ) and negative ( \u03b1\u2212 ) returns. The dashed lines in Fig. ) show these median values for Bitcoin where \u03b1+ = 4.50 and \u03b1\u2212 = 2.99. It is worth noticing that the variance of large price movements \u03c3 2 is finite only for \u03b1 > 3, as the integral \u03c3 2 \u223c \u221e r min r 2 p(r)dr diverges outside this interval. Thus, while the typical variance of large positive returns is finite for Bitcoin, negative returns are at the limit of not having a typical scale and are thus susceptible to much larger variations. Figure shows the probability distribution for the median power-law exponents of all cryptoassets grouped by large positive and negative returns. We note that the distribution of typical power-law exponents associated with large positive returns is shifted to smaller values when compared with the distribution of exponents related to large negative returns. The medians of these typical exponents are respectively 2.78 and 3.11 for positive and negative returns.",
      "This time window expands in weekly steps (seven time series observations), and for each position, we separate the positive (blue) from the negative (red) price returns. The gray line illustrates observations that will be included in future positions of the expanding time window (t > 2004). (b) Survival functions or the complementary cumulative distributions of positive (blue) and negative (red) price returns within the expanding time window for t = 2004 days and above the lower bound of the power-law regime estimated from the Clauset-Shalizi-Newman method .

(c) Time series of the power-law exponents \u03b1 t for the positive (blue) and negative (red) return distributions obtained by expanding the time window from the hundredth observation (t = 100) to the latest available price return of Bitcoin.

(d) Time series of the p-values related to the power-law hypothesis of positive (blue) and negative (red) price returns for every position of the expanding time window. The dashed line indicates the threshold (p = 0.1) above which the power-law hypothesis cannot be rejected.

All return time series in our analysis have at least 200 observations (see Supplementary Figure for the length distribution). Figure (a) illustrates Bitcoin's series of daily returns. To investigate whether and how returns have changed over the aging and growing processes of all cryptocurrencies, we sample all time series of log-returns using a time window that expands in weekly steps (seven time series observations), starting from the hundredth observation to the latest return observation."

      "Compared to the traditional pole-residue method for a linear system, one of the novelties of the pole-residue method in this paper is how to deal with the higher-order poles and their corresponding coefficients. Because the proposed method derives an explicit, continuous response function of time, it is much more efficient than traditional numerical methods. Unlike the traditional Laplace domain method, the proposed method is applicable to arbitrary irregular excitations. Because the natural response, forced response and cross response are naturally obtained in the solution procedure, meaningful mathematical and physical insights are gained. In numerical studies, systems with a known equation of motion and an unknown equation of motion are investigated. For each system, regular excitations and complex irregular excitations with different parameters are studied. Numerical studies validate the good accuracy and high efficiency of the proposed method by comparing it with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Introduction\n\nMost real dynamic systems, as encountered in mechanical and civil engineering, are inherently nonlinear and include geometric nonlinearities, nonlinear constitutive relations in material or nonlinear resistances, etc. . Nonlinear problems are attracting increasing attention from engineers and scientists. This work focuses on solving nonlinear system vibration problems, i.e., computing transient responses of nonlinear oscillators under arbitrary irregular excitations based on a combination of a pole-residue operation and Volterra series. Because Volterra series are single-valued, the scope of the present study is restricted to nonlinear behaviours without bifurcations . To analyse nonlinear vibration problems, researchers have performed extensive studies and developed various mathematical methods. Popular methods include step-by-step numerical integration methods in the time domain, such as the Runge-Kutta method. This kind of method not only requires a small time-step resolution for obtaining high-precision solutions but also is prone to numerical instability .",
      "Compared to Hu et al. , which was regarded as an efficient tool to compute responses of linear systems, the generalized pole-residue method in this paper is introduced to compute responses of nonlinear systems. The proposed method involves two steps: (1) the Volterra kernels are decoupled in terms of Laguerre polynomials, and (2) the partial response related to a single Laguerre polynomial is obtained analytically in terms of the pole-residue method. Compared to the traditional pole-residue method for a linear system, one of the novelties of the generalized pole-residue method is how to deal with the higher-order poles and their corresponding coefficients. Similar to the Taylor series, the Volterra series representation is an infinite series, and convergence conditions are needed to assure that the representation is meaningful. Because the proposed method is based on the Volterra series, only the system with convergent Volterra series representation can be treated by the proposed method. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the nonlinear response is modelled by a Volterra series, and Volterra kernel functions are decoupled by Laguerre polynomials. Then, the pole-residue method for computing explicit responses is developed in Section 3. Numerical studies and discussions are given in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 5. Response calculation based on Volterra series\n\nA nonlinear oscillator, whose governing equation of motion is given by where z(t, y, \u1e8f) represents an arbitrary nonlinear term; m, c, and k are the mass, damping and linear stiffness, respectively; y(t), \u1e8f(t) and \u00ff(t) are the displacement, velocity and acceleration, respectively; and f (t) is the time-dependent excitation. If the energy of excitation f (t) is limited, the nonlinear response under zero initial conditions (i.e., zero displacement and zero velocity) can be represented by the Volterra series : where N is the order of Volterra series and In Eq. 3, h 1 (\u03c4 ) is called the first-order Volterra kernel function, which represents the linear behaviour of the system; h n (\u03c4 1 , . .",
      "When t becomes larger, both y s (t) and y c (t) diminish due to the presence of system damping, and the total response is entirely governed by y f (t). Moreover, we notice some features at t = 0 for these components, including y s (0) = \u2212y f (0) for the first-order response and y s (0) + y f (0) = \u2212y c (0) for the second-order response, which are due to imposed zero initial conditions. Conclusions\n\nConsidering arbitrary irregular excitations, an efficient generalized pole-residue method to compute the nonlinear dynamic response modelled by the Volterra series was developed. A core of the proposed method was obtaining poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions, then those of each order response modelled by each order Volterra series. Once the poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions and excitations were both available, the remaining derivation could follow a similar pole-residue method that had been developed for ordinary linear oscillators. To obtain the poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions, two steps were included: (1) using Laguerre polynomials to decouple higher-order Volterra kernel functions with respect to time and (2) obtaining poles and corresponding coefficients of Laguerre polynomials in the Laplace domain. Because the proposed method gave an explicit, continuous response function of time, it was much more efficient than traditional numerical methods. Moreover, many meaningful physical and mathematical insights were gained because not only each order response but also the natural response, the forced response and the cross response of each order were obtained in the solution procedure. To demonstrate that the proposed method was not only suitable for a system with a known equation of motion but also applicable to a system with an unknown equation of motion, two numerical studies were conducted. For each study, regular excitations and complex irregular excitations with different parameters were investigated."

The following is an example query generated by the query generator 301: ((Category: Politics) AND (global_score>80) AND (source: NewsWebsite) AND (media type: Text)). The content stream generator 304 receives candidate content items that include the channel attributes. The content stream generator 304, for the above mentioned query, receives text based articles that include the channel category politics and have a global score greater than 80. Additionally, the text based articles are from the source NewsWebsite. In one embodiment, the content stream generator 304 generates the stream by ordering the content items in order of their scores. In another embodiment, the content stream generator 304 determines an interestingness of each candidate content item to the user. The content stream generator 304 determines the interestingness by comparing the candidate content items with a model generated for the user by the model generation engine 207 and scoring them.\nwhere p is a property, that is, a setting A=a of the attributes. The latter quantity, Pr(p|user) is approximated from the user's history of interactions with content items as well as the user's search history and other opt-in data. Similarly, the former quantity, Pr(item|p) is approximated by the (suitably weighted) reciprocal of the number of items with property p (e.g., if it is expected that p=((Politics) AND (global_score>80) AND (source: NewsWebsite) AND (media type: Text)) to generate 300 items, take Pr(item|p) to be 1/300).\nwhere the properties p are summed over single-attribute properties (as opposed to all possible settings of an entire collection of attributes), and G is an exponential function of the form G(x)=2(100 x), so that when applied in this form, if there are several values of p for which Pr(item|p) Pr(p|user) is large, the sum of their G-values slowly increases. Once the scores are calculated, the content stream generator 304 generates a stream of content for the channel that is ordered according to the candidate content item scores.",
      "In one embodiment, the category identifier 374 also uses contextual information of the user to identify the channel category. The query generator 301 generates a query based on the channel category and the channel attributes and queries 710 the new content items stored on the data storage server 265. The content stream generator 304 receives 712 candidate content items that include the channel category and channel attributes. In one embodiment, the content stream generator 304 receives additional candidate content items from the collaborative filtering engine 217. The content stream generator 304 scores 714 each candidate content item by comparing it to a model generated by the model generation engine 207. The score is calculated by determining an interestingness of the candidate content item to the user. The content stream generator 304 then generates 716 the stream of content based on the scores for each candidate content item. The channel engine 240 then generates 718 a channel with the stream of content and transmits it to the user.

      "The channel generator 378 then resubmits the request based on the changes made by the user. In response to the request, the channel generator 378 receives a stream of content from the scoring engine 211 and generates the channel for the user. The generated channel is either public or private depending upon the user's preferences. In one embodiment, the user shares the channel to a community, a group of people or any internet user. The channel is then displayed to the user with an interface generated by the user interface engine 260. Referring now to FIG. 3B, one embodiment of a scoring engine 211 is shown in more detail. The scoring engine 211 includes a query generator 301, a global scorer 302 and a content stream generator 304 that are each coupled to signal line 228. The global scorer 302 is used to rank new content items that are stored in the data storage server 265 or memory 237 (depending upon the embodiment). The global scorer 302 uses signals from the different verticals to compute a global user-independent score for each item to approximate its popularity or importance within the stream that produced it. The global scorer 302 normalizes the score across streams so that items from various streams are comparable to aid in generating a quick yet reasonable ranking of items. The global score is a combination of its quality specific to the source stream (depending on the rank of the source, number of known followers of a source, etc.) and its global popularity (trigger rate on universal search, relevance to trending queries, number of clicks, long clicks received, etc.). The global scorer 302 transmits the global score to storage where it is associated with the item. The global score helps rank the items for faster retrieval. For example, if the query generated by the query generator 301 includes a request for the top ten items about skiing, those items are already organized in the data storage server 265 or memory 237 according to the global score. The query generator 301 receives a request for a stream of content for a channel from the channel engine 240. The query generator 301 generates a query based on the channel attributes that are included in the request."

When solving \\cref{si1}, the angular flux at each iteration $m$ has an error associated with it. FPSA systematically follows a predict, correct, iterate scheme. A transport sweep, one iteration in \\cref{si1}, is made for a prediction.

      "Hence, RSU predicts the RF signal (or vehciles trajectory) using the following simplified model:\n$\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)} = \\mathrm{A} \\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)} + \\mathrm{\\tilde{w}}_{t}$, \nthat differs from \\eqref{eq_continuousLevel} in the control vector $\\mathrm{U}_{\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{t}}^{(i)}}$ which is supposed to be null, i.e., $\\mathrm{U}_{\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{t}}^{(i)}} = 0$ as the dynamic rules explaining how the environmental states evolve with time are not discovered yet. Those rules can be discovered by exploiting the generalized errors (GEs), i.e., the difference between predictions and observations. The GEs projected into the measurement space are calculated as:\n$\\tilde{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}}^{} = \\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)} - \\mathrm{H} \\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}$.\nProjecting $\\tilde{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_t}^{}$ back into the generalized state space can be done as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{GE_continuousLevel_initialModel}\n    \\tilde{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_t}^{(i)} = \\mathrm{H}^{-1}\\tilde{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}}^{}=\\mathrm{H}^{-1}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}-\\mathrm{H}\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}) = \\mathrm{H}^{-1}\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)} - \\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}. \\end{equation}\nThe GEs defined in \\eqref{GE_continuousLevel_initialModel} can be grouped into discrete clusters in an unsupervised manner by employing the Growing Neural Gas (GNG).

      "\\end{equation}\n\n\\subsection{Joint Prediction and Perception}\nRSU starts predicting the RF signals it expects to receive from each vehicle based on a Modified Markov Jump Particle Filter (M-MJPF) \\cite{9858012} that combines Particle filter (PF) and Kalman filter (KF) to perform temporal and hierarchical predictions. Since the acquired C-GDBN allows predicting a certain signal's dynamic evolution based on another's evolution, it requires an interactive Bayesian filter capable of dealing with more complicated predictions. To this purpose, we propose to employ an Interactive M-MJPF (IM-MJPF) on the C-GDBN. The IM-MJPF consists of a PF that propagates a set of $L$ particles equally weighted, such that $\\{\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t,l}^{(1)}, \\mathrm{W}_{t,l}^{(1)}\\}{\\sim}\\{\\pi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(1)}), \\frac{1}{L}\\}$, where $\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t,l}^{(1)}$, $l \\in L$ and $(.^{(1)})$ is the RF signal type. In addition, RSU relies on $\\Phi$ defined in \\eqref{interactiveTM_fromRFtoGPS} to predict $\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(2)}$ realizing the discrete cluster of vehicle's trajectory starting from the predicted RF signal according to: $\\{\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(2)},\\mathrm{W}_{t,l}^{(2)}\\}{\\sim} \\{\\Phi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t,l}^{(1)}){=}\\mathrm{P}(.|\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t,l}^{(1)}), \\mathrm{W}_{t,l}^{(2)}\\}$. For each predicted discrete variable $\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t,l}^{(i)}$, a multiple KF is employed to predict multiple continuous variables which guided by the predictions at the higher level as declared in \\eqref{eq_continuousLevel} that can be represented probabilistically as $\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)}, \\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)})$. The posterior probability that is used to evaluate expectations is given by:\n\\begin{multline} \\label{piX}\n    \\pi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})=\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)},\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t-1}^{(i)})= \\\\ \\int \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)}, \\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}) \\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)})d\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)},\n\\end{multline}\nwhere $\\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)}){=}\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t-1}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)})$. \nThe posterior distribution can be updated (and so representing the updated belief) after having seen the new evidence $\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}$ by exploiting the diagnostic message $\\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})$ in the following form: $\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}, \\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}) { =} \\pi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})\\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})$. Likewise, belief in discrete hidden variables can be updated according to: $\\mathrm{W}_{t,l}^{(i)}{=}\\mathrm{W}_{t,l}^{(i)}\\lambda (\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)})$ where:\n$\\lambda (\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}) {=} \\lambda (\\mathrm{\\Tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\Tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}) {=} \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\Tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\Tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)})$.\n\n\\subsection{Joint GPS spoofing and jamming detection}\nRSU can evaluate the current situation and identify if V2I is under attack, or the satellite link is under spoofing based on a multiple abnormality indicator produced by the IM-MJPF. The first indicator calculates the similarity between the predicted RF signal and the observed one, which is defined as:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq_CLA1}\n    \\Upsilon_{\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}} = -ln \\bigg( \\mathcal{BC} \\big(\\pi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}),\\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}) \\big) \\bigg),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{BC}(.){=}\\int \\sqrt{\\pi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}),\\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}})d\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}$ is the Bhattacharyya coefficient.",
      "The transition system model defined in \\eqref{eq_discreteLevel} explains the evolution of the discrete random variables $\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{t}}^{(i)}$ representing the clusters of the RF (or GPS) signal dynamics, $\\mathrm{f}(.)$ is a non linear function of its argument and the additive term $\\mathrm{\\tilde{w}}_{t}$ denotes the process noise. The dynamic model defined in \\eqref{eq_continuousLevel} explains the RF signal dynamics evolution or the motion dynamics evolution of the $n$-th vehicle, where $\\mathrm{\\Tilde{X}_{t}}^{(i)}$ are hidden continuous variables generating sensory signals, $\\mathrm{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ and $\\mathrm{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ are the dynamic and control matrices, respectively, and $\\mathrm{U}_{\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{t}}^{(i)}}$ is the control vector representing the dynamic rules of how the signals evolve with time. The measurement model defined in \\eqref{eq_observationLevel} describes dependence of the sensory signals $\\mathrm{\\Tilde{Z}_{t}}^{(i)}$ on the hidden states $\\mathrm{\\Tilde{X}_{t}}^{(i)}$ that is parametrized by the measurement matrix $\\mathrm{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ where $d$ stands for the data dimensionality and $\\mathrm{\\tilde{v}}_{t}$ is a random noise. \\subsection{Learning GDBN} The hierarchical dynamic models defined in \\eqref{eq_discreteLevel}, \\eqref{eq_continuousLevel} and \\eqref{eq_observationLevel} are structured in a Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (GDBN) \\cite{9858012} as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig_GDBN_CGDBN}-(a) that provides a probabilistic graphical model expressing the conditional dependencies among random hidden variables and observable states. The generative process explaining how sensory signals have been generated can be factorized as:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq_generative_process}\n\\begin{split}\n    \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}, \\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}, \\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}) = \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{0}^{(i)}) \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{0}^{(i)}) \\\\ \\bigg[ \\prod_{t=1}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}) \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)}, \\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}) \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t-1}^{(i)}) \\bigg],\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{0}^{(i)})$ and $\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{0}^{(i)})$ are initial prior distributions, $\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})$ is the likelihood, $\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)}, \\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)})$ and $\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t-1}^{(i)})$ are the transition densities describing the temporal and hierarchical dynamics of the generalized state-space model. The generative process defined in \\eqref{eq_generative_process} indicates the cause-effect relationships the model impose on the random variables $\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}$, $\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}$ and $\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}$ forming a chain of causality describing how one state contributes to the production of another state which is represented by the link $\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}$.\n\nThe RSU starts perceiving the environment using a static assumption about the environmental states evolution by assuming that sensory signals are only subject to random noise."

      "Consider the case in which there are $N_I$ incoming channels and $N_O$ outgoing ones; we can indicate with $E^{\\rm in,out}_k$ the input/output electromagnetic field phasors of channel $k$. In the most general case, i.e., without making any particular assumptions on the field polarizations, each light mode and its polarization polarization state can be represented by means of the $4$-dimensional Stokes vector. Each $ t_{ki}$ element of $\\mathbb{T}$, thus, is a $4 \\times 4$ M{\\\"u}ller matrix. If, on the other hand, we know that the source is polarized and the observation is made on the same polarization, one can use a scalar model and adopt Jones calculus \\cite{Goodman85,Popoff10a,Akbulut11}:\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n E^{\\rm out}_k = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_I}  t_{ki} E^{\\rm in}_i \\qquad \\forall~ k=1,\\ldots,N_O\n \\label{eq:transm}\n \\end{eqnarray}\n  We recall that the elements of the transmission matrix are random complex coefficients\\cite{Popoff10a}. For the case of completely unpolarized modes, we can also use a scalar model similar to Eq. \\eqref{eq:transm}, but whose variables are  the intensities of the outgoing/incoming fields, rather than the fields themselves.\\\\ \nIn the following, for simplicity, we will consider Eq. (\\ref{eq:transm}) as our starting point,\nwhere $E^{\\rm out}_k$, $E^{\\rm in}_i$ and $t_{ki}$ are all complex scalars. If Eq. \\eqref{eq:transm} holds for any $k$, we can write:\n  \\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\int \\prod_{k=1}^{N_O} dE^{\\rm out}_k \\prod_{k=1}^{N_O}\\delta\\left(E^{\\rm out}_k - \\sum_{j=1}^{N_I}  t_{kj} E^{\\rm in}_j \\right) = 1\n  \\nonumber\n  \\\\\n  \\label{eq:deltas}\n  \\end{eqnarray}\n\n Observed data are a noisy representation of the true values of the fields. Therefore, in inference problems it is statistically more meaningful to take that noise into account in a probabilistic way, \n rather than looking  at the precise solutions of the exact equations (whose parameters are unknown). To this aim we can introduce Gaussian distributions whose limit for zero variance are the Dirac deltas in Eq.",
      "(\\ref{eq:transm}). As the variance $\\Delta^2\\to 0$, eventually, the initial set of Eqs. (\\ref{eq:transm}) are recovered. The ${\\cal H}$ function, thus, plays the role of an Hamiltonian and  $\\Delta^2$ the role of a noise-inducing temperature. The exact numerical problem corresponds to the zero temperature limit of the statistical mechanical problem. Working with real data, though, which are noisy, a finite ``temperature''\n  allows for a better representation of the ensemble of solutions to the sets of equations of continuous variables. Now, we can express every phasor in Eq. \\eqref{eq:z}  as $E_k = A_k e^{\\imath \\phi_k}$. As a working hypothesis we will consider the intensities $A_k^2$ as either homogeneous or as \\textit{quenched} with respect to phases. The first condition occurs, for instance, to the input intensities $|E^{\\rm in}_k|$ produced by a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) with homogeneous illumination \\cite{Popoff11}. With \\textit{quenched} here we mean, instead, that the intensity of each mode is the same for every solution of Eq. \\eqref{eq:transm} at fixed $\\mathbb T$.\nWe stress that, including intensities in the model does not preclude the inference analysis but it is out of the focus of the present work and will be considered elsewhere. If all intensities are uniform in input and in output, this amount to a constant rescaling for each one of the four sectors of matrix $\\mathbb J$ in Eq. (\\ref{def:J}) that will not change the properties of the matrices. For instance, if the original transmission matrix is unitary, so it will be the rescaled one and the matrix $\\mathbb U$ will be  diagonal. Otherwise, if intensities are \\textit{quenched}, i.e., they can be considered as constants in Eq. (\\ref{eq:transm}),\nthey are inhomogeneous with respect to phases. The generic Hamiltonian element will, therefore, rescale as \n  \\begin{eqnarray}\n  E^*_n J_{nm} E_m = J_{nm} A_n A_m e^{\\imath (\\phi_n-\\phi_m)} \\to J_{nm} e^{\\imath (\\phi_n-\\phi_m)}\n  \\nonumber\n  \\end{eqnarray}\n  and the properties of the original  $J_{nm}$ components are not conserved  in the rescaled one. In particular, we have no argument, anymore, to possibly set the rescaled $U_{nm}\\propto \\delta_{nm}$.\n  Eventually, we end up with the complex couplings $XY$ model, whose real-valued Hamiltonian is written as\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\mathcal{H}& = &  - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{nm} J_{nm} e^{-\\imath (\\phi_n - \\phi_m)}  + \\mbox{c.c.} \n    \\label{eq:h_im}\n\\\\    &=&  - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{nm} \\left[J^R_{nm} \\cos(\\phi_n - \\phi_m)+\n  J^I_{nm}\\sin (\\phi_n - \\phi_m)\\right] \n  \\nonumber\n \\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $J_{nm}^R$ and $J_{nm}^I$ are the real and imaginary parts of $J_{nm}$. Being $\\mathbb J$  Hermitian, $J^R_{nm}=J^R_{mn}$ is symmetric and $J_{nm}^I=-J_{mn}^I$ is skew-symmetric.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\\textcolor{red}{\nF: comment about quenched:",

For $p=2$, one recovers the Ising model, for $p=4$ the Ashkin-Teller model \\cite{Ashkin43}, for $p=6$ the ice-type model \\cite{Pauling35,Baxter82} and the eight-vertex model \\cite{Sutherland70,Fan70,Baxter71} for $p=8$.  \nIt turns out to be very useful also for numerical implementations of the continuous $XY$ model. Recent analysis on the multi-body $XY$ model has shown that for a limited number of discrete phase values ($p\\sim 16, 32$) the thermodynamic critical properties of the $p\\to\\infty$ $XY$ limit are promptly recovered \\cite{Marruzzo15, Marruzzo16}. Our main motivation to study statistical inference is that these kind of models have recently turned out to be rather useful in describing the behavior of optical systems, \nincluding standard mode-locking lasers \\cite{Gordon02,Gat04,Angelani07,Marruzzo15} and random lasers \\cite{Angelani06a,Leuzzi09a,Antenucci15a,Antenucci15b,Marruzzo16}. In particular, the inverse problem on the pairwise XY model analyzed here might be of help in recovering images from light propagated through random media.

Only the people who design and maintain the bus really know what a bus is at a relatively high resolution. Even then the designer doesn't really know the bus on the street because a bus is not just a collection of parts but takes it's meaning from an even more complex social and physical environment. If you're a realist you assume that the bus can in theory be defined down to it's subatomic particles and a high resolution image of what it is can be created. The problem is that human perspective such an approach strips meaning from the image. The other problem is that the kind of truth that a purely scientific approach provides tends to confuse the thing itself with it's mathematical model. The kind of absolutism that math provides is always subjective first because the parameters are always finite but the environment from our perspective is practically infinite and second because the model is an approximation even if 2+2 is always 4. A reductionist approach is a practical necessity that doesn't satisfy the evolutionary imperative for meaning. The old view that everything can be reduced to cause and effect is itself challenged by the accepted view that determinism itself breaks down at tiny scales. Myself I'm not bothered by the indeterminate because I'm a pragmatist and close enough seems to satisfy practical solutions, scientific issues and philosophical questions.",

We humans can only experience 'experiences' (sensations; sense data), not the 'real' things or objects themselves. Furthermore, we have no way of knowing if these experiences represent 'real' objects, or are just simply products of illusion; hallucination, delusion, dream, mirage, etc. For this reason, solipsism is a possibility (i.e. it is just as plausible as it is not), and true self-awareness is not possible (i.e. we don't experience objects, including those called 'self') DragonFly wrote: There is no direct (literal) view of the actual reality 'out there'.

One of the reasons could be that Intel works with much higher margins than many of the commodity companies like Samsung and TSMC.Outside of the P4 flop and some of the monopolistic abuses, Intel has typically been selling to high end customers that are willing to pay a premium for \"the best\".",

In that situation, can Intel still justify bringing their A-game to a market where products are essentially commoditised and you have processors selling for a only a few dollars each?The lesson from their previous involvement in the DRAM market is that they probably won't want to be involved because there isn't enough money to be made to justify manufacturing phone SoCs on a cutting edge, or near cutting edge process. In that scenario, Intel may not totally abandon the market but they might just stick to manufacturing SoCs on nodes that are a step or two behind the state of the art. I think the processing is a bigger advantage than many realize. If Intel can stay ahead in process design - which this article seems to indicate - they should have a major advantage. All else being equal a 14nm chip should be significantly faster and more efficient than the same chip at 22nm. Add in the fact that yields increase geometrically - you can fit a lot more 14nm chips on a given wafer size vs 22nm (or 32nm for the other manufacturers.) and you have a very appealing proposition. And then add in the fact that Intel actually has a pretty good graphics stack and IP. It's not a sure thing by any means, but I suspect ARM may have just prodded a sleeping giant.edit: Also worth noting, Intel, TSMC, and Samsung are the only manufacturers who are building out 450nm wafers.",

That's true as long as most people are still buying both a tablet and a laptop when each needs to be replaced. I think the assumption is that, as you say, the tablet market will saturate, with people just replacing existing ones, but the desktop/laptop market could decrease much farther than that, if most people stop replacing them at all. I'm not sure of the likelihood of that, but I think that's where this idea comes from. ggeezz wrote:Intel cannot abandon the phone/tablet market.

      "The proximity of SC gives rise to two further exchange mechanisms that\ndetermine the system's behavior. First of all, the (conventional)\n\\emph{RKKY interaction} appears, $J \\sim \\GS{}^2$ \\cite{RK,K,Y}. Moreover, the \\emph{CAR exchange} emerges as a consequence of finite $\\GS{}$ \\cite{Yao}. It can be understood on the basis \nof perturbation theory as follows. DQD in the inter-dot singlet state may absorb\nand re-emit a Cooper pair approaching from SC; see \\fig{system}(e)-(g). As a second-order\nprocess, it reduces the energy of the singlet, which is the ground state of isolated DQD. A similar process is not possible in the triplet state due to spin conservation. Therefore, the singlet-triplet energy splitting $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is increased (or generated for $t=J=0$). More precisely, the leading ($2$nd-order in $t$ and $\\GS{}$) terms\nin the total exchange are \n\\begin{equation}\nJ^{\\mathrm{eff}} \t\\approx \tJ + \\frac{4t^2}{U-U'+\\frac{3}{4}J} + \\frac{4\\GS{}^2}{U+U'+\\frac{3}{4}J}. \\label{Jeff}\n\\end{equation}\nUsing this estimation, one can predict $T^*$ for finite $\\GS{}$, $t$ and $J$ with \\eq{Tstar}. Apparently, from three contributions corresponding to:\n(i) RKKY interaction, (ii) direct exchange and (iii) CAR exchange, only the first may bear a negative (ferromagnetic) sign. The two other contributions always have an anti-ferromagnetic nature. More accurate expression for $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is derived in Appendix~\\ref{sec:downfolding} [see \\eq{A_J}] by the Hamiltonian down-folding procedure. The relevant terms differ \nby factors important only for large $\\GS{}/U$. Finally, it seems worth stressing that normal leads are not necessary for CAR exchange to occur. At least one of them is inevitable for the Kondo screening though, and two symmetrically coupled \nnormal leads allow for measurement of the normal conductance. It is also noteworthy that inter-dot Coulomb interactions\ndecrease the energy of intermediate states contributing to direct exchange [\\fig{system}(c)], while increasing the energy of intermediate\nstates causing the CAR exchange [\\fig{system}(f)]."

      "Figure shows classical examples of non-benzenoid non-alternant PCHs, namely, pentalene, azulene and heptalene. Whereas azulene is a stable PCH exhibiting H\u00fcckel aromaticity ([4n+2] \u03c0-electrons, n = 2), pentalene and heptalene are unstable H\u00fcckel antiaromatic compounds with [4n] \u03c0-electrons, n = 2 (pentalene) and n = 3 (heptalene). Benzinterposition of pentalene generates indacenes, consisting of two isomers s-indacene and as-indacene (Fig. ). Apart from being antiaromatic, indacenes also contain proaromatic quinodimethane (QDM) moieties (Fig. ) , which endows them with potential open-shell character. While the parent s-indacene and asindacene have never been isolated, stable derivatives of s-indacene bearing bulky substituents have been synthesized . A feasible strategy to isolate congeners of otherwise unstable non-benzenoid non-alternant PCHs is through fusion of benzenoid rings at the ends of the \u03c0-system, that is, benzannelation. For example, while the parent pentalene is unstable, the benzannelated congener indeno[2,1-a]indene is stable under ambient conditions (Fig. ) . However, the position of benzannelation is crucial for stability: although indeno[2,1a]indene is stable, its regioisomer indeno[1,2-a]indene (Fig. ) oxidizes under ambient conditions . Similarly, benzannelation of indacenes gives rise to the family of PCHs known as indenofluorenes (Fig. ), which constitute the topic of the present work. Depending on the benzannelation position and the indacene core, five regioisomers can be constructed, namely, indeno [ Practical interest in indenofluorenes stems from their low frontier orbital gap and excellent electrochemical characteristics that render them as useful components in organic electronic devices . The potential open-shell character of indenofluorenes has led to several theoretical studies on their use as non-linear optical materials and as candidates for singlet fission in organic photovoltaics . Recent theoretical work has also shown that indenofluorene-based ladder polymers may exhibit fractionalized excitations.",

      "Fundamentally, indenofluorenes represent model systems to study the interplay between aromaticity and magnetism at the molecular scale . Motivated by many of these prospects, the last decade has witnessed intensive synthetic efforts toward the realization of indenofluorenes. Derivatives of 1-4 have been realized in solution , while 1-3 have also been synthesized on surfaces and characterized using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), which provide information on molecular orbital densities , molecular structure and oxidation state . With regards to the open-shell character of indenofluorenes, 2-4 are theoretically and experimentally interpreted to be closed-shell, while calculations indicate that 1 and 5 should exhibit open-shell ground states . Bulk characterization of mesitylsubstituted 1, including X-ray crystallography, temperature-dependent NMR, and electron spin resonance spectroscopy, provided indications of its open-shell ground state . Electronic characterization of 1 on Au(111) surface using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) revealed a low electronic gap of 0.4 eV (ref. ). However, no experimental proof of an openshell ground state of 1 on Au(111), such as detection of singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs) or spin excitations and correlations due to unpaired electrons , was shown. In this work, we report the generation and characterization of unsubstituted 5. Our research is motivated by theoretical calculations that indicate 5 to exhibit the largest diradical character among all indenofluorene isomers . The same calculations also predict that 5 should possess a triplet ground state. Therefore, 5 would qualify as a Kekul\u00e9 triplet, of which only a handful of examples exist . However, definitive synthesis of 5 has never been reported so far. Previously, Dressler et al. reported transient isolation of mesityl-substituted 5, where it decomposed both in the solution and in solid state , and only the structural proof of the corresponding dianion was obtained."

      "Hyperplane arrangements have been used by Vincent and Schwager in the context of Neural Network verification. In our setting, we leverage this representation to define path preferences as preferred transitions between adjacent regions of the space. Hyperplane Arrangement\n\nWe assume a two-dimensional environment composed of m polytopic obstacles, each defined by their half-space representation (H-representation) where A i \u2208 R di\u00d72 and b i \u2208 R di , and where d i is the number of edges (hyperplanes) composing polytope i. Let n = i d i be the total number of hyperplanes. We leverage each obstacle's H-representation to construct a hyperplane arrangement of the environment as shown in fig.\n.e. a partitioning of the space into polytopes. More specifically, each location in space belongs to a polytope j for which we can write an H-representation of the form where \u03b1 j i \u2208 {\u22121, 1} di is a vector specific to polytope j and obstacle i corresponding to the relative position of any point in the set with respect to each hyperplane in O i . Fig. : Intent inference model in a hyperplane arrangement of the obstacle free space. We spatially decompose the preference \u03b8 into a set of preferred neighboring polytopes per region of the space. Within each polytope j, the human preference pj is a discrete distribution over the preferred neighbor in N (j). We assume that for a location st belonging to polytope j, and given goal g and preference pj, the observation ot and any other preference p i,i =j are conditionally independent. Concatenating elements from each obstacle's Hrepresentation, we can write polytope j's H-representation as where Some of the constraints in eq. ( ) (corresponding to rows of A, b and \u03b1 j ) are redundant, i.e. the set P j does not change upon their removal. We can further reduce the Hrepresentation of a polytope to include only non-redundant constraints. By removing the rows corresponding to redundant constraints, we obtain new matrices A j e , b j e and \u03b1 j e such that we can write the polytope's reduced H-representation as The non-redundant constraints correspond to edges of the polytope.",
      "In other words, as the robot continually moves in space, the first hyperplane that it will cross upon exiting the polytope will correspond to one of the polytope's nonredundant constraints. Vincent and Schwager outline an iterative method for removing redundant constraints by solving n linear programs. We use this method in practice for computing \u03b1 j e for each polytope. We can now characterize each polytope by a vector \u03b1 j e \u2208 {\u22121, 1} n j e , where n j e \u2264 n is the number of essential constraints of the polytope. The polytopes P j partition the environment into a hyperplane arrangement. Path Preference\n\nIn this section, we provide a definition of preference \u03b8 according to a graphical representation of the environment based on the hyperplane arrangement. Under this representation, a path preference corresponds to a set of preferred transitions. In other words, for each polytope in the space, the human will have a preference to which neighboring polytope they wish to transition. Let G := (V, E) be an undirected graph, where vertices are obstacle-free polytopes, and edges connect two adjacent polytopes. Each polytope is described by a unique vector \u03b1 j as defined in eq. ( ). Two polytopes are adjacent if they share non-redundant constraints (rows in eq. ( )) corresponding to the same hyperplane (i.e. they are on opposite sides of the hyperplane). Let N (v) be the set of neighbors of a vertex v. For each vertex, we denote p v the discrete-valued random variable describing which edge in N (v) the human intends to transition to. Using this formalism, we define a path preference as the set of preferred transitions over all nodes in the graph, Let m \u03b8 = v\u2208V |N (v)| be the cardinality of \u0398, and m g = |\u2126 g | the number of possible goals. A priori, the number of Bayesian updates required to update the belief at every iteration should be m \u03b8 \u00d7 m g . Now, let us assume the conditional independence relationships described by the new problem diagram in fig. . More specifically, we introduce the assumption that conditioned on a robot location s t , the goal g, and the preference for the corresponding vertex p v in the graph, the observation o t and the preference for any other vertex are conditionally independent.",

      "The\naccreted material is partially expelled, obscuring the X-ray emission\nfrom the surface of the white dwarf. At later stages, the ejected\nmaterial expands further and becomes optically thin, revealing the\nnuclear burning on the surface of the white dwarf.

Models of the classical nova SSS\nstate can be found in Tuchman \\& Truran (1998) and Sala \\& Hernanz\n(2005).

      "Such a state originates from nuclear burning on\nthe surface of the white dwarf, and measurements of the intensity,\nduration, and temperature can be used to estimate the distance to the\nnova and the mass of the white dwarf (e.g. Balman et al.\\ 1998; Lanz\net al.\\ 2005). Indeed, we believe (Section~4) that the white dwarf\nwithin XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 may be quite massive\n($>$1.2$M_{\\odot}$). As discussed earlier, classical novae are almost always discovered\noptically in the early phases of their outbursts. XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 is very unusual therefore in that it has been\ndiscovered first in X-rays. As such, it is useful to compare it with\nXMMSL1~J070542.7-381442 (also known as V598 Pup; Read et al.\\ 2008),\nanother nova recently discovered (in X-rays) in the XMM-Newton slew\nsurvey. With a peak $m_{V}$ of $\\ltsim12$, XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 is\nnot a particularly bright nova (c.f. V598 Pup, which reached an\nm$_{V}$ of $\\raisebox{-1mm}{$\\stackrel{<}{\\sim}$}$4), and so it is not surprising that it went\nunnoticed, only being discovered in X-rays during the later (here\n291\\,days after the outburst), optically thin nebular phase, when\nclassical novae are typically observed as soft X-ray sources. Though\nthis delay should be taken as a upper limit, it is long when compared\nto V598 Pup ($\\raisebox{-1mm}{$\\stackrel{<}{\\sim}$}$127 days), but may instead be more similar to the\ndelays of $\\sim$200 days seen in V1974 Cyg (Krautter et al.\\ 1996),\n$\\sim$6 months of V382 Vel (Orio et al.\\ 2002), and 6$-$8 months of\nV1494 Aql (Drake et al.\\ 2003). In their X-ray monitoring of optical\nnovae in M31, Pietsch et al.\\ (2007) detect 11 out of 34 novae in\nX-rays within a year after their optical outbursts. Seven novae are\nseen to be X-ray bright, several (3$-$9) years after outburst, and\nthree novae showed very short X-ray outbursts, starting within\n50\\,days of outburst, but lasting only two to three months. XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 therefore is not particularly unusual. A method to estimate the distance to the nova is to use the relation\nbetween the absolute magnitude at maximum brightness and the time that\nthe light curve takes to decline 2 magnitudes below maximum\nbrightness, $t_{2}$ (Della Valle \\& Livio 1995).",
      "This is shown in Fig.\\ref{xrtuvotspec}. This\nexcess in UV emission (most of the $10^{35}$\\,ergs s$^{-1}$ discussed\nabove) is likely due to a combination of residual post-nova nuclear\nburning on the surface of the white dwarf, plus accretion in the disk,\nincluding from emission lines. The situation is likely to be rather\ncomplex, depending on the structure of both the ejecta and the\naccretion disk, and is beyond the scope of the present work, where we\nonly have sparse UV data. For a review of the UV emission from\nclassical novae, see Shore (2008). \\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=100 15 580 710,clip,width=6.0cm,angle=270]{12082f7.ps}\n\\caption{Swift-XRT spectrum (black) from XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933, plus\n  the best-fit black-body model to this spectrum (Section~3; Fig.\\,2),\n  but extending into the UV to the Swift-UVOT UVW2 flux points (coloured)\n  (see text).

In some embodiments, a media application may use a content-recognition module to determine the context of an event and distribute itemized tasks to multiple entities in order to generate the supplemental information about the event. While viewing media assets (e.g., a television program), users may wish to learn more information about an event (e.g., a statement made by a person appearing in the media asset, the validity of a claim in an advertisement, etc.) occurring in the media asset. While some media assets allow a user to select additional options or added features (e.g., pop-up biographies about the cast and crew), when the added features appear and what topic the added features concern are determined by the content producer and not the user. Furthermore, as the added feature is derived from the content producer, the added feature may be biased or may present limited viewpoints about an event. Therefore, added features provided by a content producer may not provide the added information about an event that a user desires. In order to gain the added information that a user desires, the user may use additional devices (e.g., a laptop computer) to search (e.g., using an Internet search engine) for more information about the event. However, without knowing the proper context (e.g., who said the statement, what was the tone of the statement, when was the statement said, etc.) of the event or what search terms to use to describe the context of the event (e.g., how to describe the tone of the statement), a user may not be able to determine (even using a search engine) more information about the event.",
      "Moreover, the use of general search terms may not provide the accuracy or precision needed by the user. Furthermore, even if a user may eventually determine the information, the effort and time required may distract the user from the media asset. Accordingly, methods and systems are described herein for quickly and easily displaying supplemental information about an event occurring in a media asset. In some embodiments, a media application may use a content-recognition module to determine the context of an event in a media asset and distribute itemized tasks to multiple users in order to generate the supplemental information about the event. The context-recognition module prevents the user from being distracted from the media asset (e.g., while the user attempts to describe the context of the event or search for information about the event). In addition, by distributing tasks to multiple entities (e.g., crowd-sourcing), the media application may collect large amounts of information in relatively short periods of time (or in real-time) and aggregate and/or filter the information to generate the supplemental information about the event based on multiple viewpoints and/or sources. By using multiple viewpoints and/or sources, the media application enhances the completeness (e.g., by providing unbiased information) and accuracy of the supplemental information. For example, when a statement or action is made by a character or person appearing on a media asset (e.g., a television program), a user may request supplemental information about the statement or action. In response, the media application may determine the context of the statement (e.g., who said the statement and to what the statement was referring) or action (e.g., what was the reason for the action). After determining the context of the statement or action, the media application may itemize into tasks the additional information it requires in order to generate the supplemental information. The media application may then transmit requests including the tasks to a plurality of other users.",
      "For example, media application may aggregate, append, and/or compare the additional information in each of the messages received from the plurality of users. The supplemental information may then be generated based on the aggregated, appended, and/or compared additional information (e.g., as described in FIG. 9 below). In some embodiments, the plurality of users may receive summary information about the event with the request for additional information. (e.g., a video clip of a portion or segment of the media asset, a textual description, etc.), which may help the plurality of users provide additional information. For example, in some embodiments, the media application may instead of (or in addition to) determining the context of an event, determine a particular portion of the event that would be needed for the plurality of users to provide additional information about the event. For example, the media application may use progress information associated with the progress of the media asset (e.g., line 506 (FIG. 5)) to determine at what point during the progression of the media asset the event occurred, and in response, transmit a portion of the media asset beginning ten second before that point and ending ten seconds after that point. For example, if the event is a statement made by a character or person in a media asset, the media application may determine when the statement began (e.g., the point of progress of the media asset in which the statement began) and ended. The media application may then include the portion containing the entire statement (and the event) in the request for additional information sent to the plurality of users. The selected portion may include any amount of summary information that the media application determines is necessary for the user or any one of the plurality of users to understand the main action sequence. This summary information (e.g., a portion of the media asset) may be included with the request for additional information (e.g., in a file transmitted with the request), or may be included with the generated supplemental information as a reference for the user."

      "They noticed that chicks fed only fat-depleted chow developed hemorrhages and started bleeding from tag sites.[82] Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet. It appeared that \u2013 together with the cholesterol \u2013 a second compound had been extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. The new vitamin received the letter K because the initial discoveries were reported in a German journal, in which it was designated as Koagulationsvitamin. Edward Adelbert Doisy of Saint Louis University did much of the research that led to the discovery of the structure and chemical nature of vitamin K.[83] Dam and Doisy shared the 1943 Nobel Prize for medicine for their work on vitamin K (K1 and K2) published in 1939. Several laboratories synthesized the compound(s) in 1939.[84]\nFor several decades, the vitamin K-deficient chick model was the only method of quantifying vitamin K in various foods: the chicks were made vitamin K-deficient and subsequently fed with known amounts of vitamin K-containing food. The extent to which blood coagulation was restored by the diet was taken as a measure for its vitamin K content. Three groups of physicians independently found this: Biochemical Institute, University of Copenhagen (Dam and Johannes Glavind), University of Iowa Department of Pathology (Emory Warner, Kenneth Brinkhous, and Harry Pratt Smith), and the Mayo Clinic (Hugh Butt, Albert Snell, and Arnold Osterberg).[85]\nThe first published report of successful treatment with vitamin K of life-threatening hemorrhage in a jaundiced patient with prothrombin deficiency was made in 1938 by Smith, Warner, and Brinkhous.[86]\nThe precise function of vitamin K was not discovered until 1974, when three laboratories (Stenflo et al.,[87] Nelsestuen et al.,[88] and Magnusson et al.[89]) isolated the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor prothrombin (factor II) from cows that received a high dose of a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin.",
      "It was shown that, while warfarin-treated cows had a form of prothrombin that contained 10 glutamate (Glu) amino acid residues near the amino terminus of this protein, the normal (untreated) cows contained 10 unusual residues that were chemically identified as \u03b3-carboxyglutamate (Gla). The extra carboxyl group in Gla made clear that vitamin K plays a role in a carboxylation reaction during which Glu is converted into Gla. The biochemistry of how vitamin K is used to convert Glu to Gla has been elucidated over the past thirty years in academic laboratories throughout the world. ^ \"Vitamin K Overview\".

Please review the contents of the article and add the appropriate references if you can. Unsourced or poorly sourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2015) This article is about the family of vitamers. For vitamin K1 the form usually used as a supplement, see Phytomenadione. Vitamin K structures. MK-4 and MK-7 are both subtypes of K2. Vitamin K deficiency, Warfarin overdose\nVitamin K is a group of structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamins the human body requires for complete synthesis of certain proteins that are prerequisites for blood coagulation and which the body also needs for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues. The vitamin K-related modification of the proteins allows them to bind calcium ions, which they cannot do otherwise. Without vitamin K, blood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding occurs. Low levels of vitamin K also weaken bones and promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues[citation needed]. Chemically, the vitamin K family comprises 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (3-) derivatives. Vitamin K includes two natural vitamers: vitamin K1 and vitamin K2.[1] Vitamin K2, in turn, consists of a number of related chemical subtypes, with differing lengths of carbon side chains made of isoprenoid groups of atoms. Vitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables because it is directly involved in photosynthesis. It may be thought of as the plant form of vitamin K. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2. Bacteria in the gut flora can also convert K1 into vitamin K2. In addition, bacteria typically lengthen the isoprenoid side chain of vitamin K2 to produce a range of vitamin K2 forms, most notably the MK-7 to MK-11 homologues of vitamin K2."

      "Notice anyone missing? It is just a silly Youtbue video but I find it very telling that the school left out the Head Coach. This is college football. Your head coach is the face of the program. Ours isn't even mentioned in a direct marketing message to our most loyal customers. There are many likely explanations for Spaz's absence. He's not particularly good on camera. He's never really shown any sort of enthusiasm for this sort of thing. And I think BC has heard enough to know that Spaz is not very popular with our fan base. No reason to trot him out when it will just dampen excitement about the upcoming season. I like Bill McGovern and Doug Martin. Both are capable coordinators and leaders. Martin's been a head coach and I know McGovern wants to be one, so giving them face time is not a bad idea. Let's hope they are also given autonomy this year (which hasn't been Spaz's strong suit with coordinators). If these two are given real power, season ticket holders will probably be happy they renewed. Labels: BC marketing, Bill McGovern, Doug Martin, fire Spaz, Speculating with Spaz, Video\nOptimism from Football Outsiders and other links\nI am a sucker for football analytics and I also really respect CBS's Matt Hinton. So when his ACC preview piece on Football Outsiders listed BC with a .500 record and a 3rd place finish in the division, I was pleasantly surprised. FO is betting on our returning players and the positive trends of the last few games of 2011. I still don't know what to think about the upcoming season, but my love for BC and articles like this have me looking on the bright side. BC is sending Emmett Cleary and Kaleb Ramsey to Greensboro to represent the school during ACC media days. I think this is actually a great sign for BC and for both players. I expected Cleary to have a break out season last year. He was good, but not all conference. Maybe this year is his chance to shine and get on NFL radars. Ramsey has always had the talent. His health and attitude have been bigger issues. If he is healthy and focused this year, he will be a game changer on D.\nHere is more on our newest recruit out of Cincinnati Truman Gutapfel.",

Spaz is gone. Back to back 8 loss seasons would be too much. The diehards are already calling for his head. Another embarrassing and hard to watch season would kill goodwill among the casual BC fans. 8-4 or better... Spaz is safe. We have the talent and the schedule to be this good. I don't think it will happen, but if it does we will see Year 5 of the Spaz era. 6 or 7 wins... Spaz \"retires.\" He gets his money. He gets to go out with a winning record. He saves face. This is probably the best outcome for everyone. This is the unknown in my opinion. I could see the powers that be wanting to keep him one more year. Especially if we end on a high note. Labels: Coach Flip is running the show, fire Spaz, Speculating with Spaz\nCoaches to Watch this fall Part 3: Current Defensive Coordinators\nBC has turned to college coordinators in the past to step up as Head Coach. While there is risk with any hire, the nice thing about a rising coordinator is that they've usually proven themselves adapt at one phase of the game and you have the chance to hire the next great football mind. Plus most coordinators come in hungry and hard working, looking to make the most of their first chance as a head coach. Because Spaz is a a defensive coach, I am sure BC fans will want a replacement with an offensive background, but that doesn't mean we should overlook these guys. Pat Narduzzi\nDefensive Coordinator, Michigan State\nUntil Bruce Feldman dropped his name as a Spaz replacement, I don't think many BC fans were even thinking about Narduzzi. On paper he's a very solid candidate. He's got BCS experience at Michigan State. The Spartans love him and recently gave him a huge raise. While they haven't been elite, I like what Michigan State has done under Dantonio (and Narduzzi). They overachieve given their talent base and work hard on the recruting front.",
      "No BC player made the ACC's preseason all conference team. They have two likeable but rather unknown Seniors on the cover of the media guide. Perception matters in college football. Obviously tickets sales are part of that, but lacking a star player hurts when TV networks are selecting our games. Even if some of our players have breakout years, they will have a hard time winning national awards. BC created some new and unique ticket packages to help attendance for the less attractive games. If we are play well, TV networks might pay attention during the last month of the season. But if the team struggles, it will be hard to sell anything. You can't force players to be great or be dynamic personalities. Even if players aren't well known, I am consistently proud of how they handle themselves. But BC can ask its coach to sell the program. Spaz doesn't and won't. But I hope that when we hire a new coach that sales and marketing aspect are not ignored.

      "A possible weight function is w(j) = q(j). More generally, we can have w(j) = q(j) p for some exponent p (typically between 1 and 2). Of course, several details of the conflict optimizer are left open. For example, which element to choose from S, whether some random noise should be added to w, and the decision to restart the procedure from scratch after a certain time. The CSP as is, does not apply to optimization problems. However, we can, impose a maximum value k of the objective function in order to obtain a CSP. The conflict optimizer was introduced in a low makespan coordinated motion planning setting. In that setting, the variables are the robots, the domains are their paths (of length at most k) and the constraints forbid collisions between two paths. In the graph coloring setting, the domains are the k colors of the vertices and the constraints forbid adjacent vertices from having the same color. The conflict optimizer can be adapted to non-binary CSP, but in that case multiple variables may be unassigned for a single violated constraint. The strategy has some resemblance to the similarly named min-conflicts algorithm , but notable differences are that a partial evaluation is kept instead of an invalid evaluation and the weight function that changes over time. While the conflict optimization strategy is simple, there are different ways to apply it to the graph coloring problem. The goal of the paper is to present how the top three teams applied it or complemented it with additional strategies. We compare the relative benefits of each variant on the instances given in the CG:SHOP 2022 challenge. We also compare them to baselines on some instances issued from graph coloring benchmarks. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the details of the conflict optimization strategy applied to graph coloring. In the three sections that follow, the three teams Lasa, Gitastrophe, and Shadoks present the different parameters and modified strategies that they used to make the algorithm more efficient for the CG:SHOP 2022 challenge.",
      "Adding the conflict-minimization phase gave minor improvements to some of the challenge instances. Shadoks\n\nIn this section, we describe the choices used by the Shadoks team for the options described in Section 2.1. The Shadoks generally chose to eliminate the color with the smallest number of elements. However, if the multistart option is toggled on, then a random color is used each time. The conflict set S is stored in a queue. The Shadoks tried other strategies, but found that the queue gives the best results. The weight function used is w(u) = 1 + q(u) p , mostly with p = 1.2. The effect of the parameter p is shown in Fig. . Notice that in all figures, the number of colors shown is the average of ten executions of the code using different random seeds. The algorithm uses \u03c3 = 0.15, easy vertices, q max = 59022, but does not use the BDFS nor any clique. If q(u) is larger than a threshold q max , the Shadoks set w(u) = \u221e so that the vertex u never reenters S. If at some point an uncolored vertex v is adjacent to some vertex u of infinite weight in every color class, then the conflict optimizer is restarted. When restarting, the initial coloring is shuffled by moving some vertices from their initial color class to a new one. Looking at Fig. , the value of q max does not seem to have much influence as long as it is not too small. Throughout the challenge the Shadoks almost exclusively used q max = 2000 \u2022 (75000/m) 2 , where m is the number of vertices. This value roughly ensures a restart every few hours. q max =0.5k q max =5k q max =50k q max =100k q max =250k The Shadoks use the function f as a Gaussian random variable of mean 1 and variance \u03c3. A good default value is \u03c3 = 0.15. The effect of the variance is shown in Fig. . Notice that setting \u03c3 = 0 gives much worse results. Option (e) The goal of BDFS is to further optimize very good solutions that the conflict optimizer is not able to improve otherwise. Fig. shows the influence of BDFS. While on this figure, the advantages of BDFS cannot be noticed, its use near the end of the challenge improved about 30 solutions.",
      "Our goal is to partition the vertices using a minimum set of k color classes C = {C 1 , . . . , C k }, where no two vertices in the same color class C i are incident to a common edge. Conflict Optimization\n\nTABUCOL inspired neighbourhood One classical approach for the vertex coloring involves allowing solutions with conflicting vertices (two adjacent vertices with the same color). It was introduced in 1987 and called TABUCOL. It starts with an initial solution, removes a color (usually the one with the least number of vertices), and assigns uncolored vertices with a new color among the remaining ones. This is likely to lead to some conflicts (i.e. two adjacent vertices sharing a same color). The local search scheme selects a conflicting vertex, and tries to swap its color, choosing the new coloring that minimises the number of conflicts. If it reaches a state with no conflict, it provides a solution with one color less than the initial solution. The process is repeated until the stopping criterion is met. While the original TABUCOL algorithm includes a \"tabu-list\" mechanism to avoid cycling, it is not always sufficient, and requires some hyper-parameter tuning in order to obtain a good performance on a large variety of instances. To overcome this issue, we use a neighbourhood, but replace the \"tabu-list\" by the conflict optimizer scheme presented above. PARTIALCOL inspired neighbourhood PARTIALCOL another local search algorithm solving the vertex coloring problem was introduced in 2008. This algorithm proposes a new local search scheme that allows partial coloring (thus allowing uncolored vertices). The goal is to minimize the number of uncolored vertices. Similarly to TABUCOL, PARTIALCOL starts with an initial solution, removes one color (unassigning its vertices), and performs local search iterations until no vertex is left uncolored. When coloring a vertex, the adjacent conflicting vertices are uncolored. Then, the algorithm repeats the process until all vertices are colored, or the stopping criterion is met."

      "a whole discharge summary from free-form inpatient records - . The free-form data is more challenging since it is noisier than structured data. In inputting of the free-form data, extractive summarization methods, which extract sentences from the source, are commonly used , - . On the other hands, an encoder-decoder model was used for abstractive summarization , , with a limited number of studies. The various issues in the abstractive generation of discharge summary would be studied in the future. Studies using medical meta-information have long been conducted on a lot of tasks - . In abstractive summarization on discharge summary,  developed a model incorporating similarity of progress notes and information of the record author. They presented an idea of integrating meta-information into the abstractive summarization model on medical documents, but did not reveal how meta-information would affect the quality of the summaries. Our method is based on the encoder-decoder transformer model. The transformer model is known for its high performance and has been widely used in recent studies, thus it is suitable for our purpose. As shown in Figure , the standard input to a transformer's encoder is created by a token sequence T = [t 0 , t 1 , ..., t i ] and position sequence P = [p 0 , p 1 , ..., p i ], where i is the maximum input length. The token and position sequences are converted into token embeddings E T and positional embeddings E P by looking up the vocabulary tables. The sum of E T and E P is input into the model. In this paper, we attempt to encode meta-information to feature embeddings. We follow the segment embeddings of BERT and the language embeddings of XLM , which provide additional information to the model. It is not a new idea but is suitable for our validation. Our method is formulated as follows: Let M be feature type, M \u2208 {Vanilla, Hospital, Physician, Disease, Length of stay}, since we set five types of features. Feature embeddings E M is created by looking up the feature table where m j is featue value (e.g., pysician ID, disease code, etc.) and |M | is the maximum number of differences in a feature.",
      "In this paper, we first reveal the effects of meta-information on neural abstractive summarization on admissions. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder transformer with an additional feature embedding layer in the encoder (Figure ). Hospital, physician, disease, and length of stay are used as meta-information, and each feature is embedded in the vector space. For experiments, we collect progress notes, discharge summaries and coded information from the electronic health record system, which are managed by a largest multi-hospital organization in Japan. Our main contributions are as follows: \u2022 We found that a transformer encoding meta-information generates higher quality summaries than the vanilla one, and clarified the benefit of using meta-information for medical summarization tasks. \u2022 We found that a model encoding disease information can produce proper disease and symptom words following the source. In addition, we found that the model using physician and hospital information can generate symbols that are commonly written in the summary. \u2022 We are the first to apply the abstractive summarization method to generate Japanese discharge summaries. In the studies of summarization of medical documents, it is common to retrieve key information such as disease, examination result, or medication from EHRs - . Other researchs more similar to our study targeted to help physicians get the point of medical documents quickly by generating a few key sentences - . Studies generating contextualized summaries can be categorized by the type of model inputs and architectures. Some studies produced a whole discharge summary using structured data for input - The sensitivity of the gram stain for bacterial meningitis is about 60%, and the sensitivity of the culture is not high either. Also, the glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid would have been slightly lower. Although no definitive diagnosis could be made, bacterial meningitis was the most suspicious disease. The causative organism was assumed to be MRSA, and vancomycin and meropenem (meningitis dose) were used to cover a wide range of enteric bacteria.",

Until now, the datasets used in this community are released by the Underwater Robot Professional Contest (URPC$\\protect\\footnote{Underwater Robot Professional Contest: {\\bf http://en.cnurpc.org}.}$) beginning from 2017, in which URPC2017 and URPC2018 are most often used for research. Unfortunately, as the information listed in Table \\ref{Info}, URPC series datasets do not provide the annotation file of the test set and cannot be downloaded after the contest. Therefore, researchers \\cite{2020arXiv200511552C,2019arXiv191103029L} first have to divide the training data into two subsets, including a new subset of training data and a new subset of testing data, and then train their proposed method and other \\emph{SOTA} methods. On the one hand, training other methods results in a significant increase in workload. On the other hand, different researchers divide different datasets in different ways, \n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\renewcommand\\tabcolsep{3.5pt}\n\\caption{Information about all the collected datasets. * denotes the test set's annotations are not available. \\emph{3} in Class means three types of creatures are labeled, \\emph{i.e.,} holothurian, echinus, and scallop. \\emph{4} means four types of creatures are labeled (starfish added).

The method is based on learning a dynamic interactive model encoding the cross-correlation between the received RF signals from multiple vehicles and their corresponding trajectories.

Subsequent work will extend the system model to consider more than two vehicles with different channel conditions and various modulation schemes to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. \\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}",

      "As a fundamental research method, theoretical research can provide a clear understanding of physical processes. In 1960, Rudinger et al. developed a theory that permits computing the response of bubbles to accelerations . In order to describe the formation and evolution processes of vortex structure quantitatively, many scholars have developed circulation models . However, theoretical works provide limited information. Meanwhile, in the late stage of SBI evolution, the bubble deformation and flow morphology dominated by the developed Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) are difficult to be predicted accu-rately. As the research method closest to engineering application, the experimental results are often regarded as standard results to verify the rationality and accuracy of theoretical and numerical works. To study the SBI process accurately, the scholars have made a series of improvements to experimental equipment or technique, including the generation techniques of different types of shock waves, interface formation methods, schlieren facilities, and image recognition techniques . Among these, two of important and valuable works are performed by Ding et al.. Based on the soap film technique, they formed kinds of initial interfaces with different curvatures through the wire-restriction method and captured the wave patterns and interface evolution with high-speed schlieren photography . Other works, such as evolutions of a spherical gas interface under reshock conditions , developments of a membrane-less SF 6 gas cylinder under reshock conditions , and interactions of a cylindrical converging shock wave with an initially perturbed gaseous interface , are also performed by many other scholars. However, we know that the experimental studies mainly depend on the experimental platform. When studying some complex and demanding condition problems, it takes much work to build the experimental platform. In this situation, numerical simulation research becomes an option.",
      "The difference between S NOMF and S NOEF increases with decreasing specific-heat ratio. Conclusions\n\nSpecific-heat ratio effects on the interaction between a planar shock wave and a 2-D heavy-cylindrical bubble are studied by a two-fluid DBM which has a flexible specific-heat ratio and includes several schemes for analyzing the complex physical fields. Besides the HNE that NS easily describes, the DBM pays more attention to the related TNE that NS is not convenient to describe. First, both the snapshots of schlieren images and evolutions of characteristic scales from DBM simulation are compared with those from experiment. The quantitative agreements between them indicate the following two facts: (i) the order of TNE considered in the current DBM is sufficient, (ii) the choosing of discrete velocities, spatial-temporal steps, and simulation parameters like the relaxation times are suitable for the following physical researches. Then, five cases with various specific-heat ratios are simulated. Several analysis methods for complex physical fields, including the description scheme of TNE behaviors, tracer particle method, and two-fluid model, are used to characterize the effects of specific-heat ratio on the bubble shape, deformation process, average motion, vortex motion, mixing degree of the fluid system, TNE strength, and entropy production. Specifically, for bubble shape, bubbles with different specific-heat ratios display various jet structures. The smaller the specific-heat ratio is, the stouter the jet structure can be seen. For the case with smaller specific-heat ratio, the fluid is easier to be compressed. So, the characteristic scales of bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio tend to be compressed smaller. For the bubble, the smaller the specific-heat ratio, the slower average motion. In the shock compression stage, the specific-heat ratio contributes little effects to the vortex motion. Differently, after the shock passes through the bubble, it significantly influences the vorticity around the interface and the corresponding amplitude of circulation due to the development of KHI.",
      "Generally, there are three kinds of physical modeling methods (or models) for SBI numerical research, i.e., the macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic modeling methods. Most of the existing numerical researches on SBI are related to the macroscopic modeling methods (such as the Euler and Navier-Stokes (NS) models) based on the continuous hypothesis (or equilibrium and nearequilibrium hypothesis) . For example, presented the computational results on the evolution of the shock-accelerated heavy bubbles through the multi-fluid Eulerian equation . There also exist a few SBI works based on the mesoscopic modeling method, such as the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method . The microscopic modeling methods such as the Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, is capable of capturing much more flow behaviors but restricted to smaller spatiotemporal scales because of its huge computing costs. In the numerical research on SBI, three points need to be concerned. (i) Investigation of kinetic modeling that describes the non-continuity/non-equilibrium flows. Most of the current researches are based on macroscopic models. However, there exist abundant small structure (and fast-changing patterns) behaviors and effects such as the shock wave, boundary layer, material defects, etc. For cases with small structures, the mean free path of molecules cannot be ignored compared to the characteristic length, i.e., the non-continuity (discreteness) of the system is pronounced, which challenge the rationality and physical function of the macroscopic models based on the continuity hypothesis. For cases with fast-changing patterns, the system dose not have enough time to relax to the thermodynamic equilibrium state, i.e., the system may significantly deviate from the thermodynamic equilibrium state. Therefore, the rational-ity and physical function of the macroscopic models based on the hypothesis of thermodynamic equilibrium (or near thermodynamic equilibrium) will be challenged. (ii) Improvement of method that describes the evolution characteristics of bubbles and flows morphology."

      "Additionally, we propose a probabilistic version, which captures predictive uncertainties and further improves upon the results of the deterministic framework. INTRODUCTION\n\nHigh-fidelity simulations of critical phenomena such as ocean dynamics and epidemics have become essential for decision-making. They are based on physically-motivated PDEs expressing system dynamics that span multiple spatiotemporal scales and which necessitate cumbersome computations . In recent years there is increased attention to the development of data-driven models that can accelerate the solution of these PDEs as well as reveal salient, lower-dimensional features that control the long-term evolution. In most cases, data-driven reduced-order models are not interpretable. In particular, models based on neural networks despite good predictive capabilities , they offer a black-box description of the system dynamics. A possible remedy is applying a symbolic regression to the learned neural network representation , but this adds additional computational cost due to the two-step procedure. A number of frameworks such as SINDy allows to learn interpretable dynamics but it relies on the a-priori availability of lower-dimensional descriptors and of time-derivatives which can be very noisy for both simulation and experimental data. Other frameworks are tailored to specific problems such as molecular dynamics . Here, we present a framework that only needs the value of the observables, and not their derivatives, as training data and is capable of identifying interpretable latent dynamics. The deployment of interpretable latent dynamics ensures that conservation of important properties of that are reflected in the reduced-order model . The present method is related to approaches based on the Koopman-operator extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) but uses continuous complex-valued latent space dynamics and only requires one scalar variable per latent dimension to describe the latent space dynamics. Therefore we do not have to enforce any parametrizations on the Koopman matrix .",
      "The time-continuous formulation moreover allows to incorporate sparse and irregularly sampled training data and fast generation of predictions after the training phase. By using a complex-valued latent space we can also incorporate harmonic effects and reduce the number of latent variables needed. Linear and non-linear autoencoders are used to map the observed, high-dimensional time-series to the lower-dimensional, latent representation and we identify simultaneously the autoencoder as well as the latent dynamics by optimizing a combined loss function. Hence the to tasks of dimensionality reduction and discovery of the reduced dynamics are unified while other frameworks treat the two parts separately . Apart from using an architecture based on autoencoders to identify the latent space, projection-based methods could also be employed . We are also proposing a probabilistic version of our algorithm ) that makes use of probabilistic Slow Feature Analysis . This allows for a latent representation that arart from being time-continuous, can quantify the predictive uncertainty and hierarchically decompose the dynamics into their pertinent scales while promoting the discovery of slow processes that control the system's evolution over long time horizons. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: We introduce the methodological framework as well as algorithmic details in section II. Particular focus is paid on the interpretability of the inferred lower-dimensional dynamics. In section III we present three numerical illustrations, i.e. a system of linear ODEs, a hidden Markov Model and the discretized KS-equation. We then present in section IV the probabilistic extension of the framework and apply it to the KS-equation. We conclude with a summary and a short discussion about possible next steps. We introduce the autoencoders deployed in this work, followed by the interpretable latent space dynamic and discuss the training process. We consider data from high-dimensional time series x n \u2208 R f with n = 1, ..., T .",
      "All phase-spaces were obtained by using a finite-difference operator on the data or predictions. These results are in accordance Interpretable reduced-order modeling with time-scale separation with whose LSTM-based temporal dynamic model was also able to find the correct phase space but not to track the actual dynamics for long-term predictions. Our model is not able to account for noise in the temporal evolution and thus dealing with chaotic, small-scale fluctuations is challenging. We believe that a probabilistic version of our algorithm could be advantageous here. This section contains a fully probabilistic formulation for the deterministic model discussed before. We replace the Autoencoder with a Variational Autoencoder and the ODE in the latent space with a SDE. The loss function which we optimize is the Evidence-Lower Bound (ELBO). Model Structure We postulate the following relations for our probabilistic model using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) for each dimension i of the latent space and a Wiener process W t in the latent space: We again assume that the latent variables z t are complex-valued and a priori independent. Complex variables were chosen as their evolution includes a harmonic components which are observed in many physical systems. We assume an initial conditions z 0,i \u223c CN (0, \u03c3 2 0,i ). The total parameters associated with the latent space dynamics of our model are thus {\u03c3 2 0,i , \u03c3 2 i , \u03bb i } c i=1 and will be denoted by \u03b8 together with all parameters responsible for the decoder mapping G (see next section). These parameters along with the state variables z t have to be inferred from the data x t . Based on probabilistic Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) , we set \u03c3 2 i = 2; (\u03bb j ) and \u03c3 2 0,i = 1. As a consequence, a priori, the latent dynamics are stationary. A derivation and reasoning for this choice can be found in Appendix A. Hence the only independent parameters are the \u03bb i , the imaginary part of which can account for periodic effects in the latent dynamics. Variational Autoencoder\n\nWe employ a variational autoencoder to account for a probabilistic mappings from the lower-dimensional representation z n to the high-dimensional system x n ."

      "\\section{Introduction}\n\nThe publicly available XMM-Newton slew data covers to date around 35\\%\nof the sky. The soft band (0.2$-$2 keV) sensitivity limit of the slews\n(6$\\times10^{-13}$\\,ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) is close to that of the\nROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS; Voges et al.\\ 1999), and in the medium\n(2$-$12 keV) band, the slew data goes significantly deeper\n(4$\\times10^{-12}$\\,ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) than all other previous\nlarge area surveys. Over 7700 individual sources have so far been\ndetected to a positional accuracy of 8\\arcsec. For details on the\nthe construction and\ncharacteristics of the first released XMM-Newton slew survey\ncatalogue, see Saxton et al. (2008). For details of the initial\nscience results from the slew survey, see Read et al. (2006). The comparison of XMM-Newton slew data with the RASS is now giving,\nfor the first time, the opportunity to find exotic, extreme\nhigh-variability X-ray bursting objects, e.g. tidal disruption\ncandidates (Esquej et al. 2007), and also Galactic novae, flare stars,\nand flaring white dwarfs, plus eclipsing binaries, AGN and blazars. It\nis only with such a large-area survey as the XMM-Newton Slew Survey,\nthat transient events as these have a chance of being caught. One such rare event, XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933, which we here show to be\na new Classical Nova, was discovered in an XMM-Newton slew from 18th\nJuly 2006 at a very high count rate of 23.3\\,ct s$^{-1}$ (EPIC-pn:\n0.2$-$2\\,keV). Classical novae (see Bode \\& Evans 2008 for a review) occur in\ninteracting binary systems consisting of a white dwarf primary star\nand a lower-mass secondary star. The nova itself is a cataclysmic\nnuclear explosion caused by the accretion of material (via Roche Lobe\noverflow or wind accretion) from the secondary star onto the surface\nof the white dwarf; here the pressure and temperature at the base of\nthe accreted material becomes sufficient to trigger a thermonuclear\nrunaway. A recent review of the thermonuclear processes powering\nclassical novae can be found in Starrfield et al.\\ (2008).",
      "Such a state originates from nuclear burning on\nthe surface of the white dwarf, and measurements of the intensity,\nduration, and temperature can be used to estimate the distance to the\nnova and the mass of the white dwarf (e.g. Balman et al.\\ 1998; Lanz\net al.\\ 2005). Indeed, we believe (Section~4) that the white dwarf\nwithin XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 may be quite massive\n($>$1.2$M_{\\odot}$). As discussed earlier, classical novae are almost always discovered\noptically in the early phases of their outbursts. XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 is very unusual therefore in that it has been\ndiscovered first in X-rays. As such, it is useful to compare it with\nXMMSL1~J070542.7-381442 (also known as V598 Pup; Read et al.\\ 2008),\nanother nova recently discovered (in X-rays) in the XMM-Newton slew\nsurvey. With a peak $m_{V}$ of $\\ltsim12$, XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 is\nnot a particularly bright nova (c.f. V598 Pup, which reached an\nm$_{V}$ of $\\raisebox{-1mm}{$\\stackrel{<}{\\sim}$}$4), and so it is not surprising that it went\nunnoticed, only being discovered in X-rays during the later (here\n291\\,days after the outburst), optically thin nebular phase, when\nclassical novae are typically observed as soft X-ray sources. Though\nthis delay should be taken as a upper limit, it is long when compared\nto V598 Pup ($\\raisebox{-1mm}{$\\stackrel{<}{\\sim}$}$127 days), but may instead be more similar to the\ndelays of $\\sim$200 days seen in V1974 Cyg (Krautter et al.\\ 1996),\n$\\sim$6 months of V382 Vel (Orio et al.\\ 2002), and 6$-$8 months of\nV1494 Aql (Drake et al.\\ 2003). In their X-ray monitoring of optical\nnovae in M31, Pietsch et al.\\ (2007) detect 11 out of 34 novae in\nX-rays within a year after their optical outbursts. Seven novae are\nseen to be X-ray bright, several (3$-$9) years after outburst, and\nthree novae showed very short X-ray outbursts, starting within\n50\\,days of outburst, but lasting only two to three months. XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 therefore is not particularly unusual. A method to estimate the distance to the nova is to use the relation\nbetween the absolute magnitude at maximum brightness and the time that\nthe light curve takes to decline 2 magnitudes below maximum\nbrightness, $t_{2}$ (Della Valle \\& Livio 1995).",
      "Note further\nthat the (pile-up corrected) spectral model normalizations to the\ninitial Slew discovery data (Sect.~2) also imply an approximate\ndistance to XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 of $\\sim$50\\,kpc. The source had, at the time of the slew detection, an absorbed\n(0.2$-$2\\,keV) X-ray flux of 4.8$^{+2.7}_{-1.6}\\times10^{-11}$\\,ergs\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a 0.2$-$2\\,keV X-ray luminosity\n(at 50\\,kpc) of 1.4$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\\times10^{37}$\\,ergs s$^{-1}$. Assuming instead for the moment a distance more like 100\\,kpc (though\nthis is thought to be well beyond the LMC, e.g. Kovacs 2000), then the\n(0.2$-$2\\,keV) X-ray luminosity of\n5.7$^{+3.0}_{-1.9}\\times$$10^{37}$\\,erg s$^{-1}$ obtained is at the high end of the X-ray luminosities of\nclassical SSS-phase novae discussed e.g.\\,in Orio et al.\\ (2002) and Ness et al.\\ (2007). As discussed though, we have very likely missed\nthe outburst peak, and as such, our more probable assumed distance of\n50\\,kpc gives rise to a more typical SSS-phase X-ray luminosity. The\nluminosities of 7$-$8$\\times$$10^{34}$\\,erg s$^{-1}$, obtained during\nthe Swift and pointed XMM-Newton observations, are more typical of\nnovae at later times, when the emission can also sometimes be\ndescribed by a thermal plasma, rather than a black-body type spectrum,\nor a more mixed spectrum, due to the complex structure of the ejecta\nand the accretion disk (Krautter 2008, Shore 2008).\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nA bright X-ray source, XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933, was detected in an\nXMM-Newton slew on 18 July 2006 at a position where no previous X-ray\nsource had been seen. The XMM-Newton slew data, plus follow-up dedicated\nXMM-Newton and Swift observations, plus optical imaging and\nspectroscopic data acquired with the Magellan Clay telescope and \nAll-Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) data were used to classify the new object\nas a nova, and to examine its properties. The primary conclusions are\nas follows:\n\n  \\begin{itemize}\n\n  \\item The soft X-ray spectrum indicates that the nova was in a\n    super-soft source (SSS) state at its discovery in July 2007\n    (XMM-Newton slew) and through its X-ray decline (by over two\n    orders of magnitude) in September 2006 (XMM-Newton slew), March\n    2007 (Swift) and June 2007 (XMM-Newton)."

Two limiting relationships between the optimal test and a series of the CUSUM-OAL tests are established. Moreover, we give the estimation of the in-control and the out-of-control average run lengths (ARLs) of the CUSUM-OAL test. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations in detecting mean shifts of the observations sequence. INTRODUCTION In order to quickly detect a change in distribution of observations sequence without exceeding a certain false alarm rate, a great variety of sequential tests have been proposed, developed and applied to various fields since proposed a control chart method, see, for example, , , One of popular used sequential tests is the following upper-sided CUSUM test which was proposed by .\nwhere c > 0 is a constant control limit, Z i = log[p v 1 (X i )/p v 0 (X i )], p v 0 (x) and p v 1 (x) are prechange and post-change probability density functions respectively for a sequence of mutually independent observations {X i , i \u2265 1}, that is, there is a unknown change-point \u03c4 \u2265 1 such that X 1 , ..., X \u03c4 \u22121 have the probability density function p v 0 , whereas, X \u03c4 , X \u03c4 +1 , ... have the probability density function p v 1 .",

      "Ambient sensors also help capture the movement patterns of objects and humans for activity and behavior recognition \\cite{dawadi14,dawadi15}. Researchers also proved the existence of correlations between cognitive impairment and everyday task performance \\cite{dawadi14, akl15,alam16} as well as physiological symptoms \\cite{alam16,sano15}. Although current studies showed some successes in IoT-assisted cognitive health assessment in different domains individually, there are several existing challenges in developing and validating a fully automated multi-modal assessment model. \\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\emph{Real-time IoT System}: A real-time IoT system must include a continuous and fault tolerant data streaming capability among central hub, wearable sensors and ambient sensors regardless of network communication protocol (WiFi, Ethernet, Bluetooth etc.) which are not available in existing researches. \\item \\emph{Multi-modal Context Fusion}: Though several offline clinically validated cognitive health assessment tools exist \\cite{wai03, starling99, krapp07, yesavage82, zung71}, there is no universally accepted method for IoT-assisted automatic cognitive health assessment in smart home environment that can fuse multi-modal sensor contexts altogether. For example, some researchers showed ambient sensors based Activities of Daily Livigin (ADLs) sequence pattern can signify the cognitive health status of older adults \\cite{akl15, dawadi15}. Researchers also showed wearable Electrodermal Activity pattern analysis may carry the significance of cognitive status \\cite{sano15}. However, for validation of IoT based cognitive health assessment, self-reported surveys, clinical diagnosis and observation based tools are used individually by prior researchers \\cite{akl15, dawadi15, sano15, alam16}. \\end{enumerate}\n\nRegarding aforementioned challenges for the automation of cognitive health assessment, \\emph{AutoCogniSys} considers (i) reproducibility of our model in any smart home system consists of ambient motion sensors, wearable accelerometer (ACC) sensors, wearable Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors individually or combined streams; (ii) context awareness based on ambient motion sensors and wearable ACC sensors in any types of activities such as hand gestural, postural and complex ADLs; and (iii) high accuracy, i.e., a recall rate of over 90\\% with less than 5\\% false positive rate.",
      "At first, we obtain instant hand gestural and postural activities from our above proposed models, and additionally motion sensor and object sensor readings from our IoT-system for every time instant generating a 4-hierarchy of HDBN model. Considering the context set $\\langle gestural, postural, ambient,object\\rangle$ as a hierarchical activity structure (extending two 2-hierarchical HDBN \\cite{alam16b}), we build complex activity recognition model for single inhabitant scenario. Finally, we infer the most-likely sequence of complex activities (and their time boundaries), utilizing the well-known Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm \\cite{dempster77} for training and the Viterbi algorithm \\cite{forney73} for run-time inference. \\section{Automatic Activity Features Estimation}\nThe effects of cognitive ability on daily activity performance have been studied before \\cite{dawadi14,akl15}. They experimentally and clinically validated that cognitive impairment highly reduces the daily activity performances and this activity performance can be computed as an indicator of cognitive ability status of older adults. The standard activity features refer to completeness of task (TC), sequential task ability (SEQ), interruption avoidance capabilities (INT) etc. In current behavioral science literature, the above activity features carry specific definition based on the sub-tasks involved with a complex activity \\cite{dawadi14,akl15}. Completeness of task refers to how many sub-tasks are missed by the participants. Sequential task ability refers to how many sequences of sub-tasks are missed referring the gerontologist defined standard sequences of the sub-task for the particular complex activity. Interruption avoidance capability refers to how many times the participants stop or interleave while doing any sub-task. The final goal of activity features estimation is to provide overall task score. The task score is proportional to the functional ability of participants in performance daily activities.",
      "Akl et. al. proposed 18 gesture dictionary based Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier \\cite{akl11}. Wrist-worn ACC based postural activity recognition approach has been proposed using Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes and deep neural networks \\cite{gj14, wang16}, the accuracy stagnates at 85\\% using SVM method \\cite{martin16}. However, neither of past works proposed any technique that can provide single body worn ACC sensor-based multiple body contexts recognition nor works efficiently for diverse posture say walking normally, with walker, with double walker or wheel chair. Our proposed 8-hand gesture recognition technique assisted sparse-deconvolution method improves classification performances on both normal and diverse postures. However, we incorporated hand gestures and postures in conjunction with ambient sensors into single-inhabitant HDBN model \\cite{alam16b} that provides significant improvement in complex activity recognition.\n\\subsection{Cognitive Health Assessment}\nSmart home environment has been used for providing automated health monitoring and assessment in the ageing population before \\cite{dawadi14, gong15, akl15, dawadi15}. `SmartFABER' proposed a non-intrusive sensor network based continuous smart home environmental sensor data acquisition and a novel hybrid statistical and knowledge-based technique to analyz the data to estimate behavioral anomalies for early detection of mild-cognitively impairment \\cite{riboni16}. \\cite{skubic15} presented an example of unobtrusive, continuous monitoring system for the purpose of assessing early health changes to alert caregivers about the potential signs of health hazards. Though, prior researches proposed a sequence of ambient motion sensor streams as complex activity components in activity based health assessment \\cite{dawadi14, gong15, akl15, dawadi15}, we consider inclusion of an wearable wrist-band with in-built ACC sensor to detect hand gesture and posture, augmenting with the ambient sensor readings to help recognize complex activities as well as cognitive health assessment of older adults."

      "Prior attempts to solve these problems allow consumers to create personalized sections in feed aggregation websites that are defined by keywords. Often, these personalized sections present any item that includes the keywords even though the item is not of interest to the consumer, per se. In another method, consumers are allowed to manually subscribe to Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds from multiple websites. This method often leads to the consumer viewing multiple items which contain redundant information. In some examples, the specification describes a system and method for generating a stream of content for a channel using a channel application. The channel application includes a processing unit, a model generation engine, a scoring engine, a collaborative filtering engine, a content categorizer, a channel engine, and a user interface engine. The model generation engine generates a model that is used to determine suggestions for channels. The content categorizer categorizes new content items received from heterogeneous data sources. The channel engine identifies a channel category for a user based on at least one of a historical trend and a user activity. The historical trend is at least one of an increase in a number of new content items for a content category, an increase in a number of times one of the new content items is accessed and an event. A scoring engine queries the new content items based on the channel category and at least one other channel attribute. The scoring engine receives candidate content items that include the channel category and the at least one other channel attribute. The scoring engine then generates a stream of content from the candidate content items for the channel. The scoring engine transmits the stream of content to the channel engine, which generates a channel. In one embodiment, the user interface engine generates a user interface for the user to define the channel category and the channel attribute.

The specification relates to a system and method for generating a stream of content for a channel. In particular, the specification relates to generating a stream of content for a channel based on user interests and historical trends. Many consumers of digital media have two somewhat contradictory goals: keep apprised of information in the areas they already find interesting and discover new content that is also enjoyable. Keeping apprised of information can become burdensome in the digital age because there is so much information. Hence, there is a need to present the best and most relevant information, without overwhelming the consumer. Furthermore, consumers have varied interests depending on the time of a year or a day. As a result, there is also a need to cater to the time dependent changes in the consumer's interests while presenting information. Similarly, discovering new content is difficult when the consumer is overburdened with existing content.",
      "The user interface includes options for viewing a channel, requesting a new channel, modifying the user interests, and following suggested channels. FIG. 2 is a high-level block diagram illustrating another embodiment of a system for generating a stream of content for a channel. In this embodiment, the components of the channel application 103 are divided among various servers so that the information is efficiently processed. The system includes a search server 135, an entertainment server 137, a ratings server 139, an email server 141, a content categorizer 250, a data storage server 265, a model server 255, a scoring server 262, a social network server 101, a user device 115, and a channel application 103. A content categorizer 250 crawls the heterogeneous data sources (search server 135, entertainment server 137, ratings server 139, and email server 141) are crawled for new content items by the content categorizer 250 or the new content items are directly transmitted to the content categorizer 250. The content categorizer 250 categorizes the new content items as mentioned above with regards to FIG. 1B and stores them in the database 267 of the data storage server 265. The content categorizer 240 also includes a processing unit 202 for processing user information (activities, interests and social connections). In one embodiment, the processing unit 202 stores the database 267. In one embodiment, the data storage server 265 dynamically phases out the old content items. For example, news items expire after 24 hours, videos expire after 48 hours and feeds are kept for 24 hours or only the 10 most recent items, whichever is larger, etc. The content categorizer 250 also transmits the new content items to the scoring server 262 for a global user ranking. The global scores are transmitted from the scoring server 262 to the data storage server 265, which stores the global scores in association with the new content items. The global scores are helpful for organizing the new content items in the data storage server 265 according to the more popular items."

      "B) They utilized a CNN model to predict annotations and then manually corrected them.",

      "D) They exclusively used images from the URPC2017 dataset due to its high image quality and existing annotations."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "In terms of the content of the dataset images, there are a large number of similar or duplicate images in the URPC datasets. URPC2017 only retains 15\\% images after removing similar images compared to other datasets. Thus the detector trained on URPC2017 is easy to overfit and cannot reflect the real performance. For other URPC datasets, the latter also includes images from the former, \\emph{e.g.}, URPC2019 adds 2,000 new images compared to URPC2018; compared with URPC2019, URPC2020$_{ZJ}$ adds 800 new images. The URPC2020$_{DL}$ adds 1,000 new images compared to the URPC2020$_{ZJ}$. It is worth mentioning that the annotation of all datasets is incomplete; some datasets lack the starfish labels and it is easy to find error or missing labels. \\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/ZhangBHRV17} pointed out that although the CNN model has a strong fitting ability for any dataset, the existence of dirty data will significantly weaken its robustness. Therefore, a reasonable dataset (containing a small number of similar images as well as an accurate annotation) and a corresponding recognized benchmark are urgently needed to promote community development. To address these issues, we introduce a dataset called Detecting Underwater Objects (DUO) by collecting and re-annotating all the available underwater datasets. It contains 7,782 underwater images after deleting overly similar images and has a more accurate annotation with four types of classes (\\emph{i.e.,} holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish). Besides, based on the MMDetection$\\protect\\footnote{MMDetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. {\\bf https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection}}$ \\cite{chen2019mmdetection} framework, we also provide a \\emph{SOTA} detector benchmark containing efficiency and accuracy indicators, providing a reference for both academic research and industrial applications. It is worth noting that JETSON AGX XAVIER$\\protect\\footnote{JETSON AGX XAVIER is an embedded development board produced by NVIDIA which could be deployed in an underwater robot.",
      "Here we employ the Perceptual Hash algorithm (PHash) to remove those images. PHash has the special property that the hash value is dependent on the image content, and it remains approximately the same if the content is not significantly modified. Thus we can easily distinguish different scenarios and delete duplicate images within one scenario. After deduplicating, we obtain 7,782 images (6,671 images for training; 1,111 for testing). The retention rate of the new dataset is 95\\%, which means that there are only a few similar images in the new dataset. Figure \\ref{exam} shows that our dataset also retains various underwater scenes. \\subsection{Image Re-annotation}\nDue to the small size of objects and the blur underwater environment, there are always missing or wrong labels in the existing annotation files. In addition, some test sets' annotation files are not available and some datasets do not have the starfish annotation. In order to address these issues, we follow the next process which combines a CNN model and manual annotation to re-annotate these images. Specifically, we first train a detector (\\emph{i.e.,} GFL \\cite{li2020generalized}) with the originally labeled images. After that, the trained detector predicts all the 7,782 images. We treat the prediction as the groundtruth and use it to train the GFL again. We get the final GFL prediction called {\\bf the coarse annotation}. Next, we use manual correction to get the final annotation called {\\bf the fine annotation}. Notably, we adopt the COCO \\cite{Belongie2014} annotation form as the final format. \\subsection{Dataset Statistics}\n{\\bf The proportion of classes}: The total number of objects is 74,515. Holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish are 7,887, 50,156, 1,924, and 14,548, respectively. Figure \\ref{pie} shows the proportion of each creatures where echinus accounts for 67.3\\% of the total. The whole data distribution shows an obvious long-tail distribution because the different economic benefits of different seafoods determine the different breed quantities.",

A previous exploratory study suggested that fruit consumption may reduce mercury exposure. The objectives of the study were to determine the effects of fruit consumption on the relation between fish consumption and bioindicators of mercury (Hg) exposure in Amazonian fish-eating communities. A cross-sectional dietary survey based on a 7-day recall of fish and fruit consumption frequency was conducted within 13 riparian communities from the Tapajos River, Brazilian Amazon. Hair samples were collected from 449 persons, and blood samples were collected from a subset of 225, for total and inorganic mercury determination by atomic absorption spectrometry. On average, participants consumed 6.6 fish meals/week and ate 11 fruits/week. The average blood Hg (BHg) was 57.1\u00c2\u00b136.3 \u00ce\u00bcg/L (median: 55.1 \u00ce\u00bcg/L), and the average hair-Hg (HHg) was 16.8\u00c2\u00b110.3 \u00ce\u00bcg/g (median: 15.7 \u00ce\u00bcg/g). There was a positive relation between fish consumption and BHg (r=0.48; P 2 =36.0%) and HHg levels (fish: \u00ce\u00b2=1.2, P 2 =21.0%). ANCOVA models showed that for the same number of fish meals, persons consuming fruits more frequently had significantly lower blood and HHg concentrations. For low fruit consumers, each fish meal contributed 9.8 \u00ce\u00bcg/ L Hg increase in blood compared to only 3.3 \u00ce\u00bcg/ L Hg increase for the high fruit consumers. In conclusion, fruit consumption may provide a protective effect for Hg exposure in Amazonian riparians. Prevention strategies that seek to maintain fish consumption while reducing Hg exposure in fish-eating communities should be pursued\nInfluence of mercury bioaccessibility on exposure assessment associated with consumption of cooked predatory fish in Spain.",

Mercury exposure as a function of fish consumption in two Asian communities in coastal Virginia, USA. Xu, Xiaoyu; Newman, Michael C\nFish consumption and associated mercury exposure were explored for two Asian-dominated church communities in coastal Virginia and compared with that of two non-Asian church communities. Seafood-consumption rates for the Chinese (36.9\u00c2 g/person/day) and Vietnamese (52.7\u00c2 g/person/day) church communities were greater than the general United States fish-consumption rate (12.8\u00c2 g/person/day).",
      "Correspondingly, hair mercury concentrations for people from the Chinese (0.52\u00c2 \u00c2\u00b5g/g) and the Vietnamese church (1.46\u00c2 \u00c2\u00b5g/g) were greater than the overall level for United States women (0.20\u00c2 \u00c2\u00b5g/g) but lower than the published World Health Organization exposure threshold (14\u00c2 \u00c2\u00b5g/g). A conventional regression model indicated a positive relationship between seafood consumption rates and hair mercury concentrations suggesting the importance of mercury exposure through seafood consumption. The annual-average daily methylmercury intake rate for the studied communities calculated by Monte Carlo simulations followed the sequence: Vietnamese community\u00c2 >\u00c2 Chinese community\u00c2 >\u00c2 non-Asian communities. Regardless, their daily methylmercury intake rates were all lower than the United States Environmental Protection Agency reference dose of 0.1\u00c2 \u00c2\u00b5g/kg body weight-day. In conclusion, fish-consumption patterns differed among communities, which resulted in different levels of mercury exposure. The greater seafood and mercury ingestion rates of studied Asian groups compared with non-Asian groups suggest the need for specific seafood consumption advice for ethnic communities in the United States. Otherwise the health benefits from fish consumption could be perceived as trivial compared with the ill-defined risk of mercury exposure. Feather growth influences blood mercury level of young songbirds. Condon, Anne M; Cristol, Daniel A\nDynamics of mercury in feathers and blood of free-living songbirds is poorly understood. Nestling eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) living along the mercury-contaminated South River (Virginia, USA) had blood mercury levels an order of magnitude lower than their parents (nestling: 0.09 +/- 0.06 mg/kg [mean +/- standard deviation], n = 156; adult: 1.21 +/- 0.57 mg/kg, n = 86). To test whether this low blood mercury was the result of mercury sequestration in rapidly growing feathers, we repeatedly sampled free-living juveniles throughout the period of feather growth and molt."

      "The Land Trust said it hopes to name the new nature refuge in honor of William Hawthorne of Hadlyme, whose family has owned the property for several generations and who has agreed to sell the property to the Land Trust at a discount from its market value if the rest of the money necessary for the purchase can be raised by the Land Trust. \u201cThis new wildlife preserve will represent a triple play for habitat conservation,\u201d said Anthony Irving, chairman of the Land Trust\u2019s Preservation Committee. \u201cFirst, it helps to protect the watershed feeding the fragile Whalebone Cove eco-system, which is listed as one of North America\u2019s important freshwater tidal marshes in international treaties that cite the Connecticut River estuary as a wetland complex of global importance. Whalebone Creek, one of the primary streams feeding Whalebone Cove, originates from vernal pools and upland swamps just south of the Hawthorne tract on the Land Trust\u2019s Ravine Trail Preserve and adjacent conservation easements and flows through the proposed preserve. Virtually all of the Hawthorne property comprises much of the watershed for Whalebone Creek. \u201cSecond, the 82 acres we are hoping to acquire with this fund raising effort represents a large block of wetlands and forested wildlife habitat between Brush Hill and Joshuatown roads, which in itself is home to a kaleidoscope of animals from amphibians and reptiles that thrive in several vernal pools and swamp land, to turkey, coyote, bobcat and fisher. It also serves as seasonal nesting and migratory stops for several species of deep woods birds, which are losing habitat all over Connecticut due to forest fragmentation. \u201cThird, this particular preserve will also conserve a key link in the wildlife corridors that connects more than 1,000 acres of protected woodland and swamp habitat in the Hadlyme area.\u201d Irving explained that the preserve is at the center of a landscape-scale wildlife habitat greenway that includes Selden Island State Park, property of the US Fish & Wild Life\u2019s Silvio O Conte Wildlife Refuge, The Nature Conservancy\u2019s Selden Preserve, and several other properties protected by the Lyme Land Conservation Trust.",
      "\u201cBecause of its central location as a hub between these protected habitat refuges,\u201d said Irving, \u201cthis preserve will protect forever the uninterrupted access that wildlife throughout the Hadlyme landscape now has for migration and breeding between otherwise isolated communities and families of many terrestrial species that are important to the continued robust bio-diversity of southeastern Connecticut and the Connecticut River estuary.\u201d Irving noted that the Hawthorne property is the largest parcel targeted for conservation in the Whalebone Cove watershed by the recently developed US Fish & Wildlife Service Silvio O Conte Wildlife Refuge Comprehensive Conservation Plan. Irving said the Land Trust hopes to create a network of hiking trails on the property with access from both Brush Hill Road on the east and Joshuatown Road on the west and connection to the Land Trust\u2019s Ravine Trail to the south and the network of trails on the Nature Conservancy\u2019s Selden Preserve. Irving said there is strong support for the Land Trust\u2019s proposal to preserve the property both within the Hadlyme and Lyme communities and among regional and state conservation groups. He noted letters of support have come from the Hadlyme Garden Club, the Hadlyme Public Hall Association, the Lyme Inland Wetlands & Watercourses Agency, the Lyme Planning and Zoning Commission, the Lyme Open Space Committee, the Lower Connecticut River Valley Council of Governments, the Lyme Garden Club, the Lyme Public Hall, The Nature Conservancy, The Silvio O Conte Refuge, the Connecticut River Watershed Council, and the Friends of Whalebone Cove, Inc.\nHe reported that between Hawthorne\u2019s gift and several other pledges the Land Trust has already received commitments of 25 percent of the cost of the property.\nFiled Under: Lyme, Outdoors, Top Story, vnn Old Lyme Tree Commission Celebrates Arbor Day April 29, 2016 by admin Leave a Comment Members of the three groups gather around the new oak tree.

      "A new community conservation group to protect Whalebone Cove, a freshwater tidal marsh along the Connecticut river in Hadlyme recognized internationally for its wildlife habitat, will hold its first organizational meeting this coming Sunday, March 6, at 4 p.m.\nCalling the group \u201cFriends of Whalebone Cove\u201d (FOWC), the organizers say their purpose is to \u201ccreate a proactive, community-based constituency whose mission is to preserve and protect the habitat and fragile eco-systems of Whalebone Cove.\u201d\nMuch of Whalebone Cove is a nature preserve that is part of the Silvio O. Conte National Wildlife Refuge (www.fws.gov/refuge/silvio_o_conte) under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFW). The Refuge owns and manages 116 acres of marshland in Whalebone Cove and upland along its shores. Prior to being taken over by USFW, the Whalebone Cove preserve was under the protection of The Nature Conservancy. As part of the Connecticut River estuary, the Cove is listed in the Ramsar Convention on International Wetlands (www.ramsar.org) as tidal marshlands on the Connecticut River that constitute a \u201cwetlands complex of international importance.\u201d The Ramsar citation specifically notes that Whalebone Cove has one of the largest stands of wild rice in the state. Except at high tide, most of the Cove is open marshland covered by wild rice stands with relatively narrow channels where Whalebone Creek winds its way through the Cove to the main stem of the Connecticut River. Brian Slater, one of the group\u2019s leaders who is filing the incorporation documents creating FOWC, said the creation of the organization was conceived by many of those living around the Cove and others in the Hadlyme area because of increased speeding motor boat and jet ski traffic in the Cove in recent years, damaging wetland plants and disrupting birds and other wildlife that make the Cove their home. Slater said \u201cOur goal is to develop a master plan for protection of the Cove through a collaborative effort involving all those who have a stake in Whalebone Cove \u2013 homeowners along its shores and those living nearby, the Silvio O. Conte Refuge, the Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection (DEEP), hunters, fishing enthusiasts, canoeing and kayaking groups, Audubon groups, the Towns of Lyme and East Haddam, The Nature Conservancy, the Connecticut River Watershed Council, the Lyme Land Conservation Trust, the Connecticut River Gateway Commission, and others who want to protect the Cove.\u201d\n\u201cSuch a plan\u201d, said Slater, \u201cshould carefully evaluate the habitat, plants, wildlife and eco-systems of the Cove and the surrounding uplands and watershed and propose an environmental management plan that can be both implemented and enforced by those entrusted with stewarding the Cove and its fragile ecosystems for the public trust.\u201d\nFOWC has written a letter to Connecticut DEEP Commissioner Rob Klee asking that he appoint a blue ribbon commission to conduct the research and develop the management plan."

Until now, the datasets used in this community are released by the Underwater Robot Professional Contest (URPC$\\protect\\footnote{Underwater Robot Professional Contest: {\\bf http://en.cnurpc.org}.}$) beginning from 2017, in which URPC2017 and URPC2018 are most often used for research. Unfortunately, as the information listed in Table \\ref{Info}, URPC series datasets do not provide the annotation file of the test set and cannot be downloaded after the contest. Therefore, researchers \\cite{2020arXiv200511552C,2019arXiv191103029L} first have to divide the training data into two subsets, including a new subset of training data and a new subset of testing data, and then train their proposed method and other \\emph{SOTA} methods. On the one hand, training other methods results in a significant increase in workload. On the other hand, different researchers divide different datasets in different ways, \n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\renewcommand\\tabcolsep{3.5pt}\n\\caption{Information about all the collected datasets. * denotes the test set's annotations are not available. \\emph{3} in Class means three types of creatures are labeled, \\emph{i.e.,} holothurian, echinus, and scallop. \\emph{4} means four types of creatures are labeled (starfish added).

The competition sets up a target recognition track, a fixed-point grasping track, and an autonomous grasping track. The target recognition track concentrates on finding the {\\bf high accuracy and efficiency} algorithm which could be used in an underwater robot for automatically grasping. The datasets we used to generate the DUO are listed below.

      "C) Standardized CPUE for threatened species is primarily influenced by fishing ground, while regulated species are more affected by engine power and trip length.",
      "D) The relationship between fishing effort and standardized CPUE differs significantly between threatened and regulated species, with threatened species exhibiting a stronger positive correlation with hook number."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "The most significant factors influencing the likelihood of catching regulated species were month (January was significantly lower: p<0.001), number of hooks (p<0.001) and engine power (<0.01). Significant factors associated with standardised CPUE of regulated species were number of hooks (p<0.001), fishing gear (<0.001), number of sets (p<0.001), engine power (p<0.01) and month (November and January: p<0.05) (Table 5 and Fig 4). Plots of most significant factors affecting standardised CPUE (number of individuals per 100 hooks per set) of regulated species: a) hook number, b) gear type, c) number of sets. Although Tanjung Luar\u2019s targeted shark fishery is small in scale, considerable numbers of shark are landed, including a large proportion of threatened and regulated species. A key finding is that measures of CPUE, for all sharks and for threatened and regulated species, vary spatially and temporally, and with several aspects of fishing effort including gear type, hook number, engine power and number of sets. Moreover, the relationships between CPUE and fishing behaviour variables are different for different measures of CPUE (CPUE per trip, CPUE per set, CPUE per 100 hooks per set). This highlights the importance of using appropriate standardisation for meaningful comparisons of CPUE across different gears and vessel types, and has important implications for fisheries management. Unstandardised CPUE (individuals per set) was significantly lower in January. This is during the west monsoon season, which is characterised by high rainfall and adverse conditions at sea for fishing. Unstandardised CPUE was also significantly lower in West Nusa Tenggara Province (WNTP) than East Nusa Tenggara Province (ENTP) and other provinces, suggesting a lower abundance of sharks in this area. Engine power had a significant positive influence on unstandardised CPUE, and was also associated with longer trips and more sets, which was likely due to the ability of vessels with larger engines to travel longer distances, over longer time periods, and with higher numbers of sets, to favoured fishing grounds.",
      "Unstandardised CPUE was also significantly higher for surface longlines than bottom longlines. However, when standardising CPUE for the number of hooks (i.e. individuals per 100 hooks per set) this relationship was reversed. Bottom longlines exhibit a higher standardised CPUE, with negative relationships between catch per 100 hooks per set and number of hooks and frequency of sets. Vessels with moderate engine horsepower (50-59hp) also had the highest standardised CPUE. Since surface longlines systematically employ significantly more hooks than bottom longlines (400\u2013600 vs 25\u2013200 hooks), and tend to be associated with larger boats, longer trips and more sets, these findings suggest that although increasing fishing effort increased total catch for these gears and trips, there were diminishing returns of this increased effort above low to moderate levels. A large proportion of Tanjung Luar\u2019s shark catch consisted of threatened (22%) and regulated species (46%). Month is a significant factor in explaining standardised CPUE of both threatened and regulated species, which could indicate seasonal variation in the abundance of these species in the Tanjung Luar fishing grounds, or seasonal impacts on CPUE due to poor weather conditions. Fishing ground was a significant factor in explaining the catch of threatened species but not the catch in regulated species. This may be due to differences in range, distribution and relative abundance of species within these groups. Threatened species make up a relatively small proportion of Tanjung Luar\u2019s catch in comparison to regulated species, which make up almost half of the catch (46%). As such, regulated species may generally be more abundant and spatially diffuse than threatened species, and therefore caught more uniformly across fishing grounds. For example, regulated species catch is dominated by silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis), which are circum-tropical and coastal-pelagic, and exhibit limited site-fidelity or aggregation behaviour, while threatened species catch is dominated by scalloped hammerheads (Sphyrna lewini), which are known to aggregate in schools.",
      "A similar pattern was observed when comparing relationships between CPUE (individuals per set) and standardised CPUE for other measures of fishing effort, including numbers of hooks, engine power and number of sets (Fig 2). There was a positive relationship between unstandardised CPUE (individuals per set) and number of hooks, number of sets and engine power, but a negative relationship between CPUE and these fishing behaviour variables when CPUE was standardised by hook number (individuals per 100 hooks per set). The best fit LM of standardised CPUE indicated that the most significant factors influencing standardised CPUE were fishing gear and number of hooks (p<0.001). Month, engine power, number of sets and fishing ground were also identified as significant variables (Table 5), although there was considerable covariance between these factors. Standardised CPUE was significantly lower in January, and decreased with higher numbers of hooks, despite a higher total catch per trip and set (Fig 2). Table 5. Analysis of variance for linear model of standardised CPUE (individuals per 100 hooks per set) data from Tanjung Luar; significant values (p<0.05) are given in bold. Best fit GLMs indicated that the most significant factors influencing the likelihood of catching threatened species were month (January and November were significantly lower: p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively) and fishing ground (Other (i.e. fishing grounds outside of WNTP and ENTP) was significantly higher: p<0.01). Significant factors associated with standardised CPUE of threatened species were number of hooks (p<0.001), fishing ground (other: p<0.001, ENTP p<0.05), engine power (p<0.001) and trip length (p<0.001) (Table 6 and Fig 3).

She was one of the most prolific prescribers of OxyContin in the state. And hundreds of thousands of those pills were being paid for by Medicaid, Florida\u2019s taxpayer-financed health program for the state\u2019s poorest and sickest citizens. Between 1999 and 2001, Medicaid shelled out $935,634 for OxyContin prescriptions written by Luyao. That was just OxyContin. Luyao was prescribing an array of addictive drugs. In the 12 months leading up to the clinic raid, Medicaid paid roughly $1 million for 7,000 prescriptions, only about 17 percent of them for OxyContin. Nor did the raid slow her down. Between the raid and her arrest on trafficking charges four months later, Luyao wrote another 282 OxyContin prescriptions billed to Medicaid. She was not an outlier. In 24 months, taxpayers footed the bill for more than 49 million doses of pills containing oxycodone, even though there were only 1.36 million Medicaid patients. Half were children. The sheer volume of pills might have been a tipoff that the drugs were not all intended for legitimate use. So were arrest reports dating to 2001. One man had used his 7-year-old son\u2019s Medicaid number to doctor-shop for OxyContin. A Miramar pharmacist who billed Medicaid $3.7 million for OxyContin pills was charged with paying Medicaid patients $150 each to use their IDs. Medicaid paid for more than $300,000 to fill Dr. James Graves\u2019 OxyContin prescriptions. The Florida Panhandle physician was the first doctor in the nation convicted of killing patients by overprescribing OxyContin.",
      "Addiction risk for people taking high doses of oxycodone begins climbing after just three days, a recent study concluded. And most people on Florida Medicaid getting oxycodone prescriptions in 2011 were getting much more than a few days worth. They were getting an average of nine months worth of pills, state officials said. Pill mill doctors prescribed 1 million of those pills:\nDoctors working for the George twins\u2019 trafficking empire prescribed at least 102,081 oxycodone pills billed to Medicaid before the ring collapsed in 2010. Working out of a Delray Beach pain clinic founded by a convicted drug smuggler, Zvi Harry Perper, son of the Broward County medical examiner, was arrested on trafficking charges, but not before he wrote prescriptions to Medicaid patients for 115,977 doses of oxycodone in 90 days. In Lake Worth, Cesar Deleon was arrestedas part of a DEA pill mill sweep and charged with 55 counts of illegally distributing drugs. Deleon wrote orders for 20,302 oxycodone pills for Medicaid patients. Miami internist Dr. Selwyn Carrington authorized 32,411 doses of oxycodone for Medicaid patients in just two years. He was busted for signing his name to hundreds of prescriptions. Further, Florida wasn\u2019t in any hurry to stop doctors linked to pill mills. Carrington was arrested for overprescribing in March 2011. The state\u2019s emergency order to suspend his license was signed months after he had pleaded guilty in 2012. Perper was busted at a Delray Beach pill mill operated by a former felon in 2011. The state did not act against his license until 2014. Joseph M. Hernandez was writing prescriptions from his car, a veritable pill mill on wheels, when he was busted in February 2010 on one count of trafficking in oxycodone. .Florida\u2019s Department of Health didn\u2019t file paperwork to restrict his license for almost 18 months. During that time, Hernandez wrote oxycodone prescriptions for Medicaid patients totaling 258,940 doses representing a taxpayer-footed bill of $130,165. Purdue Pharma\u2019s Profits Before Patients Creed\nKelly Skidmore is exactly the type of person Purdue Pharma\u2019s OxyContin marketing was intended to reach: Diagnosed with juvenile arthritis, the former state legislator\u2019s struggle with chronic pain began at age 4.",
      "How Oxycontin, Florida and the Sackler Family Created the Opioid Crisis In America\nWhy are the Sacklers worth $13 billion today? Answer: \u201cThe Oxy Express Explained\u201d\n(MASS TORT NEXUS MEDIA)\nA COMPARISON OF OXYCODONE PRESCRIBING\nIn the first six months of 2010, Ohio doctors and health care practitioners bought the second-largest number of oxycodone doses in the country at just under 1 million pills. Florida doctors bought 40.8 million in the same period, the comparison is astounding, yet it flew under the DEA, Opioid Big Pharma and everyone elses radar for years and years. Of the country\u2019s top 50 oxycodone-dispensing clinics, 49 were in Florida. From August 2008 to November 2009, a new pain clinic opened in Broward and Palm Beach counties on average of every three days. Pharmacies and distributors are at fault as well, pharmacies ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from opioid drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies. 90 of 100 of the nation\u2019s top 100 oxy-buying doctors in 2010, were in Florida. 49 of 50 of the country\u2019s top oxy-dispensing clinics were in Florida. For some reason this didn\u2019t raise an alarm or cause anyone to look further at the time. Purdue Pharma New What Was Happening In Florida\nPurdue and the Sacklers chose to ignore Florida, because apparently nobody there sued them or complained. In 2007, in other states, the infamous drug maker and three of its executives pled guilty in federal court and paid out $634.5 million in fines for purposefully misleading regulators, doctors, and patients about the addictiveness of their opioid painkiller. Around the same time, Purdue was also sued by several states, including Washington, over similar allegations. Purdue agreed to a $19.5 million multi-state settlement. And in 2015, Purdue settled a case with Kentucky, agreeing to pay $24 million. As part of the state settlements, Purdue was supposed to set up monitoring programs to make sure that its opioid drug didn\u2019t wind up in the wrong hands. It was supposed to watch out for shady pharmacies, unusually large orders, or suspiciously frequent orders."

      "\\section{Introduction}\n\nDerivate is one of the most important topics not only in mathematics, but also in physics, chemistry, economics and engineering. Every standard Calculus course provides a variety of exercises for the students to learn how to apply the concept of derivative. The types of problems range from finding an equation of the tangent line to the application of differentials and advanced curve sketching. Usually, these exercises heavily rely on such differentiation techniques as Product, Quotient and Chain Rules, Implicit and Logarithmic Differentiation \\cite{Stewart2012}. The definition of the derivative is hardly ever applied after the first few classes and its use is not much motivated. Like many other topics in undergraduate mathematics, derivative gave rise to many misconceptions \\cite{Muzangwa2012}, \\cite{Gur2007}, \\cite{Li2006}. Just when the students seem to learn how to use the differentiation rules for most essential functions, the application of the derivative brings new issues. A common students' error of determining the domain of the derivative from its formula is discussed in \\cite{Rivera2013} and some interesting examples of the derivatives, defined at the points where the functions themselves are undefined, are provided. However, the hunt for misconceptions takes another twist for the derivatives undefined at the points where the functions are in fact defined. The expression of the derivative of the function obtained using differentiation techniques does not necessarily contain the information about the existence or the value of the derivative at the points, where the expression for the derivative is undefined. In this article we discuss a type of continuous functions that have the expression for the derivative undefined at a certain point, while the derivative itself at that point exists. We show, how relying on the formula for the derivative for finding the horizontal tangent line of a function, leads to a false conclusion and consequently to missing a solution.",
      "We also provide a simple methodological treatment of similar functions suitable for the classroom.\n\n\\section{Calculating the Derivative} In order to illustrate how deceitful the expression of the derivative can be to a students' eye, let us consider the following problem. \\vspace{12pt}\n\n\\fbox{\\begin{minipage}{5.25in}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\begin{minipage}{5.0in}\n\n\\vspace{10pt}\n\n\\emph{Problem}\n\n\\vspace{10pt}\n\nDifferentiate the function $f\\left(x\\right)=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}$. For which values of $x$ from the interval $\\left[-1,1\\right]$ does the graph of $f\\left(x\\right)$ have a horizontal tangent?\n\n\\vspace{10pt}\n\n\\end{minipage}\n\n\\end{center}\n\n\\end{minipage}}\n\n\\vspace{12pt}\n\nProblems with similar formulations can be found in many Calculus books \\cite{Stewart2012}, \\cite{Larson2010}, \\cite{Thomas2009}. Following the common procedure, let us find the expression for the derivative of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ applying the Product Rule:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nf'\\left(x\\right) &=& \\left(\\sqrt[3]{x}\\right)'\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}+\\left(\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}\\right)'\\sqrt[3]{x} \\notag \\\\ &=& \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}}\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}+2x\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}\\sqrt[3]{x} \\notag \\\\ &=& \\frac{6x^2\\cos{x^2}+\\sin{x^2}}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}} \\label{DerivativeExpression}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nSimilar to \\cite{Stewart2012}, we find the values of $x$ where the derivative $f'\\left(x\\right)$ is equal to zero:\n\\begin{equation}\n6x^2\\cos{x^2}+\\sin{x^2} = 0 \n\\label{DerivativeEqualZero}\n\\end{equation}\n\nSince the expression for the derivative (\\ref{DerivativeExpression}) is not defined at $x=0$, it is not hard to see that for all values of $x$ from $\\left[-1,1\\right]$ distinct from zero, the left-hand side of (\\ref{DerivativeEqualZero}) is always positive. Hence, we conclude that the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ does not have horizontal tangent lines on the interval $\\left[-1,1\\right]$.\n\nHowever, a closer look at the graph of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ seems to point at a different result: there is a horizontal tangent at $x=0$ (see Figure \\ref{fig:FunctionGraph}).",
      "x \\neq 0 \\\\ \n0, & \\mbox{if } x = 0 \n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nThe expression for the derivative of the function provides the correct value of the derivative only for those values of the independent variable, for which the expression is defined; it does not tell anything about the existence or the value of the derivative, where the expression for the derivative is undefined. Indeed, let us consider the function\n\\begin{equation*}\ng\\left(x\\right) = {\\sqrt[3]{x}}\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}\n\\end{equation*}\nand its derivative $g'\\left(x\\right)$ \n\\begin{equation*}\ng'\\left(x\\right) = \\frac{\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}-6x^2\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nSimilar to the previous example, the expression for the derivative is undefined at $x=0$. Nonetheless, it can be shown that $g\\left(x\\right)$ is not differentiable at $x=0$ (see Figure \\ref{fig:GFunction}). Therefore, we provided two visually similar functions: both have the expressions for their derivatives undefined in zero, however, one of these functions possesses a derivative, but the other one does not.\n\n\\section{Methodological Remarks} Unfortunately, there exist many functions similar to the ones discussed above and they can arise in a variety of typical Calculus problems: finding the points where the tangent line is horizontal, finding an equation of the tangent and normal lines to the curve at the given point, the use of differentials and graph sketching. Relying only on the expression of the derivative for determining its value at the undefined points may lead to missing a solution (as in the example discussed above) or to some completely false interpretations (as in the case of curve sketching). As it was discussed above, the expression for the derivative does not provide any information on the existence or the value of the derivative, where the expression itself is undefined. Here we present a methodology for the analysis of this type of functions. Let $f\\left(x\\right)$ be the function of interest and $f'\\left(x\\right)$ be the expression of its derivative undefined at some point $x_{0}$."

      "(7) into Eq. (6). This new form of energy bands is finally used to compute the conduction gap of strained junctions. As a simple example, in the case of $\\phi = 0$ (armchair direction), we calculate the conduction gap as follows. First, Eq. (6) is rewritten in the form\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n E_{\\phi = 0}\\left( {\\vec \\kappa} \\right) =  \\pm \\left| {{t_1}{e^{i\\kappa_y/2}} + {t_2}{e^{ - i\\kappa_y/2}} + {t_3}{e^{ - i\\kappa_x/2}}} \\right|\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith the vectors $\\vec L_{x,y} \\equiv \\vec L_{x,y}^0$. Using this new form, the energy gap of strained graphene for a given $\\kappa_y$ is determined as\n\\begin{equation}\n{E_{strain}^{gap}}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right) = 2 \\left| {\\sqrt {{{\\left( {{t_1} - {t_2}} \\right)}^2} + 4{t_1}{t_2}{{\\cos }^2}\\frac{{{\\kappa_y}}}{2}}  + {t_3}} \\right|\n\\end{equation}\nwhile ${E_{unstrain}^{gap}}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ is given by the same formula with $t_1$ = $t_2$ = $t_3$ $\\equiv$ $t_0$. The gap of transmission probability through the junction is then determined as ${E_{junc}^{gap}}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right) = \\max \\left[ {E_{unstrain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right),E_{strain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)} \\right]$ and, finally, the conduction gap is given by ${E_{cond.gap}} = \\min \\left[ {E_{junc}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)} \\right]$ for $\\kappa_y$ in the whole Brillouin zone. We would like to notice that the Green's function calculations and the banstructure analyses give the same results of conduction gap in the junctions where the transition region between unstrained and strained graphene sections is long enough, i.e., larger than about 5 to 6 nm. In the case of short length, as discussed in \\cite{baha13,hung14}, this transition zone can have significant effects on the transmission between propagating states beyond the energy gaps and hence can slightly enlarge the gap of conductance, compared to the results obtained from the bandstructure calculations. \\section{Results and discussion}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.0in]{Fig02.pdf}\n\\caption{Dependence of graphene bandgap (in the unit of eV) on the applied strain and its direction: tensile (a) and compressive (b).",
      "Therefore, our calculation has two steps, similar to that in \\cite{hung14}. From the graphene bandstructures obtained using the tight-binding Hamiltonian above, we first look for the energy gaps $E_{unstrain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ and $E_{strain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ for a given $\\kappa_y$ of two graphene sections. The maximum of these energy gaps determines the gap $E_{junc}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ of transmission probability through the junction. Finally, the conduction gap $E_{cond.gap}$ is obtained by looking for the minimum value of $E_{junc}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ when varying $\\kappa_y$ in the whole Brillouin zone. In particular, the energy bands of strained graphene are given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n E\\left( {\\vec k} \\right) =  \\pm \\left| {{t_1}{e^{i\\vec k{{\\vec a}_1}}} + {t_2}{e^{i\\vec k{{\\vec a}_2}}} + {t_3}} \\right|\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere the plus/minus sign corresponds to the conduction/valence bands, respectively. For a given direction $\\phi$ of transport, in principle, the vectors $\\vec L_{x,y}$ defining the sizes of unit cell along the Ox and Oy directions, respectively, can be always expressed as ${\\vec L_x} = {n_1}{\\vec a_1} + {n_2}{\\vec a_2}$ and ${\\vec L_y} = {m_1}{\\vec a_1} + {m_2}{\\vec a_2}$ with $\\cos \\phi = \\frac{{{{\\vec L}_x}\\vec L_x^0}}{{{L_x}L_x^0}}$ and $\\sin \\phi = \\frac{{{{\\vec L}_x}\\vec L_y^0}}{{{L_x}L_y^0}}$ while $\\vec L_{x,y}^0 = {\\vec a_1} \\pm {\\vec a_2}$. Note that $n_{1,2}$ and $m_{1,2}$ are integers while $\\frac{{{m_1}}}{{{m_2}}} =  - \\frac{{{n_1} + 2{n_2}}}{{{n_2} + 2{n_1}}}$, i.e., ${\\vec L_{x}} {\\vec L_{y}} = 0$. In other words, we have the following expressions\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{{{\\vec a}_1} = \\frac{{ - {m_2}{{\\vec L}_x} + {n_2}{{\\vec L}_y}}}{{{n_2}{m_1} - {n_1}{m_2}}};\\,\\,\\,{{\\vec a}_2} = \\frac{{{m_1}{{\\vec L}_x} - {n_1}{{\\vec L}_y}}}{{{n_2}{m_1} - {n_1}{m_2}}}}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nOn this basis, the energy bands can be rewritten in terms of $\\kappa_{x, y} = \\vec k \\vec L_{x,y} \\left( { \\equiv {k_{x,y}}{L_{x,y}}} \\right)$ by substituting Eqs.",
      "The appearance of this conduction gap, as mentioned previously, is due to the strain-induced shift of Dirac points and is explained as follows. Actually, the strain causes the lattice deformation and can result in the deformation of graphene bandstructure. Therefore, the bandedges as a function of wave-vector $k_y$ in unstrained and strained graphene can be illustrated schematically as in the top panel of Fig. 4. As one can see, the shift of Dirac points leads to the situation where there is no value of $\\kappa_y$, for which the energy gaps $E_{unstrain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ and $E_{strain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ are simultaneously equal to zero. This means that the transmission probability always shows a finite gap for any $\\kappa_y$. For instance, the energy gap is zero (or small) in the unstrained (resp. strained) graphene section but finite in the strained (resp. unstrained) one in the vicinity of Dirac point $k_y = K_{unstrain}$ (resp. $K_{strain}$). Accordingly, as illustrated in the pictures of LDOS in the left panels of Fig. 4 and confirmed in the corresponding transmissions in the right panels, clear gaps of transmission are still obtained. Far from these values of $k_y$, $E_{unstrain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ and $E_{strain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ are both finite (e.g., see the LDOS plotted for $k_y = K_{gap}$) and hence a finite gap of transmission also occurs. On this basis, a finite gap of conductance is achieved. More important, Fig. 3 shows that besides the strength of strain, the strain effect is also strongly dependent on the applied direction. For instance, the conduction gap takes the values of $\\sim$ 295, 172 and 323 meV for $\\theta = 0$, $30^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$, respectively. Below, we will discuss the properties of the conduction gap with respect to the strain, its applied direction, and the direction of transport. Note that due to the lattice symmetry, the transport directions $\\phi$ and $\\phi + 60^\\circ$ are equivalent while the applied strain of angle $\\theta$ is identical to that of $\\theta + 180^\\circ$."

We choose $t=0$ for the sake of simplicity and\nanalyze a wide range of $\\GS{}$, starting from the case of anti-ferromagnetic \nRKKY interaction ($J>0$). Large $J>0$ leads to the formation of a molecular singlet in the \nnanostructure.",
      "For reference, results for $\\GS{}=0$ are shown, exhibiting \nthe two-stage Kondo effect caused by \\emph{direct} exchange mechanism. As can be seen in \\figs{G-T}(b) and \\ref{fig:G-T}(c), an excellent agreement of $T^*$ found from NRG calculations and \\eq{Tstar} \nis obtained with $a=0.42$ and $b=1.51$, the same for both $U'=0$ and $U'=U/10$. Note, \nhowever, that $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is different in these cases, cf. \\eq{Jeff},\nand $U'$ leads to increase of $T^*$.\n\nFurthermore, for $t=0$ and $\\GS{}>0$ the two-stage Kondo effect caused solely by the \\emph{CAR\nexchange} is present; see \\fig{G-T}(a). Experimentally, this situation\ncorresponds to a distance between the two QDs smaller than the superconducting coherence length,\nbut large enough for the exponentially suppressed direct hopping to be negligible. While intuitively one could expect pairing to compete with any kind of magnetic ordering,\nthe Kondo screening induced by CAR exchange is a beautiful example of a superconductivity\nin fact leading to magnetic order, namely the formation of the Kondo singlet. This CAR-exchange-mediated Kondo screening is our main finding. For such screening, \\eq{Tstar} is still fulfilled with very similar \nparameters, $a=0.37$ ($a=0.35$) and $b=1.51$ ($b=1.50$) for $U'=0$ ($U'=U/10$),\ncorrespondingly; see \\figs{G-T}(b-c). Moreover, as follows from \\eq{Jeff}, $U'$ reduces CAR exchange, and therefore diminishes $T^*$.\nFor the same values of $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the dependence of $G(T)$ for $t=0$ and $\\GS{}>0$ is hardly different \nfrom the one for $\\GS{}=0$ and $t>0$ for $T\\geq T^*$ (results not shown). However, $G(T)$ saturates at residual value $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ as $T\\to 0$ only for finite\n$\\GS{}$, which at particle-hole symmetry makes $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$\nthe hallmark of SC proximity and the corresponding CAR exchange processes. From numerical results, one can estimate it as\n\\begin{equation}\nG_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{e^2}{h} \\cdot c \\ , \\frac{\\GS{}^2}{U^2} \n\t\\qquad {\\scriptstyle (\\GS{1}=\\GS{2}=\\GS{})} ,\n\\label{Gmin}\n\\end{equation}\nwith $c\\approx 2.25$, barely depending on $U'$ and getting smaller for $t>0$. \nThis is illustrated in \\figs{G-T}(d-e), where the dotted line corresponds to \\eq{Gmin} with $c=2.25$. \n\nLastly, in \\fig{G-T}(a) we also present the curves obtained for $t=\\GS{}$ chosen such, \nthat the quantity $\\xi=\\sqrt{t^2+\\GS{}^2}$ remains the same \nin all the cases.",
      "Furthermore, for $|\\delta_1| \\sim |\\delta_2| \n\\sim \\delta$, the residual conductance caused by the lack of PHS, $G_{\\mathrm{min}} \\approx e^2/h \\cdot (\\delta/U)^2$,\nwhich is a rapidly decreasing function in the vicinity of PHS point, as illustrated in \\fig{asym}(b)\nwith lines denoted by a square. Evidently, in the regime $|\\delta_i| < 0.01U$ the residual conductance\ncaused by SC is orders of magnitude larger, leading to the plateau in $G_{\\mathrm{min}}(\\delta_1)$ dependence,\nvisible in \\fig{asym}(b). Taking into account that the realistic values of $U$ in the semiconductor quantum dots are rather \nlarge, this condition seems to be realizable by fine-tuning of QD gate voltages. Lastly, let us point out that while in the presence of only one exchange mechanism, \\emph{CAR} or\n\\emph{direct}, $G_{\\mathrm{min}}(\\delta_1)$ dependencies depicted in \\fig{asym}(b) are symmetrical with respect\nto sign change of $\\delta_1$, for \\emph{both} exchange mechanisms the dependence is non-symmetric. \n\n\\section{Effects of asymmetry of couplings to superconductor}\n\\label{sec:x}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{Fig5.pdf}\n\\caption{\n\t\t (a) Linear conductance between the normal leads, $G$, as a function of temperature, $T$,\n\t\t for parameters corresponding to \\fig{G-T}(a) with $\\xi=U/10$, for different values \n\t\t of asymmetry coefficient $x$ [see \\eq{xGS}], in the presence of \\emph{CAR} exchange only. %\n\t\t (b) The second-stage Kondo temperature $T^*$ normalized by $T_K$ as a function of $x$, \n\t\t calculated with the aid of NRG (points) and a fit to \\eq{Tstar} (lines) \n\t\t with $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ from \\eq{Jeff}. %\n\t\t (c) The zero-temperature conductance $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ as a function of QD1 coupling to SC lead, $\\GS{1}$,\n\t\t compiled from data obtained at different circumstances (as indicated in the legend)\n\t\t for different $x$.

      "The larger the difference in specific-heat ratio between the bubble and ambient gas, the higher the degree of material mixing. Effects of specific-heat ratio on various TNE quantities are different. These differences consistently show the complexity of TNE flows which is still far from a clear understanding. In addition, it is found that the temporal evolution of the entropy production rates \u1e60NOMF and \u1e60NOEF both show three stages because of the influence of the shock wave location. The smaller the specific-heat ratio, the larger the velocity gradient, which indirectly enhances the strength of \u1e60NOMF . The specific-heat ratio increases the \u1e60NOEF by raising the temperature gradient. The influence of specific-heat ratio on S NOEF is more significant than that on S NOMF . Effects of specific-heat ratio on entropy production caused by NOMF and NOEF are contrary. Specifically, the entropy production contributed by NOMF increases with reduced specific-heat ratio. But the entropy production caused by NOEF first reduces with decreasing specific-heat ratio and then approaches to a saturation value. When the specific-heat ratio \u03b3 is smaller than a threshold value \u03b3 c (\u03b3 c \u2248 1.315), the entropy production induced by NOEF is more significant than that caused by NOMF. However, in the case of \u03b3 > \u03b3 c , the situation reverses. The fundamental research in this paper helps to understand the interaction mechanism between shock waves and bubbles in ICF, supersonic combustors, underwater explosions, etc. The effects of viscosity and heat conduction on the interaction between shock waves and bubbles will be studied in the following work. where the subscript \"m, n\" means that the m-order tensor is contracted to n-order tensor. According to the CE multiscale analysis, the Boltzmann-BGK equation can be reduced to the hydrodynamic equations. In the following part, the derivation process from Boltzmann-BGK equation to a two-fluid hydrodynamic equation are shown. More details can see the reference presented by Zhang et al. .",
      "In the first stage (t < 0.03), cases with different specific-heat ratios show various trends. At the stage where the bubble deformation is not very large, i.e., 0.03 < t < 0.06, values of \u1e60NOEF fluctuate near the average value. In the third stage (t > 0.06), evolutions of \u1e60NOEF in cases with larger specific-heat ratios show an apparent growing tendency. Differently, the values of \u1e60NOEF in cases with smaller specific-heat ratios remain almost unchanged. The influence of specific heat ratio on the \u1e60NOEF , similar with the effect on NOEF, is also affected by the heat conductivity and the temperature gradient. It can be seen that, except for the case of \u03b3 = 1.09, the larger the specific-heat ratio, the higher entropy production rate \u1e60NOEF . The temporal evolutions of \u1e60NOEF of case \u03b3 = 1.09 and case \u03b3 = 1.12 are very similar. Consequently, the specific-heat ratio increases the \u1e60NOEF by raising the temperature gradient. Further understanding can be seen in Fig. , where the entropy productions over this period are plotted. For convenience, the sum and difference between S NOMF and S NOEF are also plotted in the figure. The variation range of S NOEF is larger than that of S NOMF . It indicates that the influence of specific-heat ratio on S NOEF is more significant than that on S NOMF . Effects of specific-heat ratio on entropy production caused by NOMF and NOEF are contrary. Specifically, it can be seen that the entropy production contributed by NOMF increases with re- duced specific-heat ratio. But the entropy production caused by NOEF first reduces with decreasing specific-heat ratio and then approaches to a saturation value. The S NOEF in case \u03b3 = 1.09 is almost the same with it in case \u03b3 = 1.12. When the specificheat ratio \u03b3 is smaller than a threshold value \u03b3 c (\u03b3 c \u2248 1.315), the entropy production induced by NOEF is more significant than that caused by NOMF. However, in the case of \u03b3 > \u03b3 c , the situation reverses. The temporal evolution of the total entropy production (S NOMF +S NOEF ) is similar to the S NOEF profile.",
      "Therefore, these two aspects comprehensively influence the material diffusion between the two fluids. Due to the complex reflected shock wave, the global mixing degree shows a tendency for oscillating growth. Effects of specific-heat ratio on TNE behaviors\n\nThe investigation of TNE behaviors is of great importance for understanding the kinetics process on SBI. These TNE quantities describe the fluid system deviating from the thermodynamic state from their own perspectives. The effects of specific-heat ratio on global TNE strength, i.e., D * 2 , D * 3 , D * 3,1 , and D * 4,2 , are shown in Fig. . It can be seen that the effects of specific-heat ratios on various TNE quantities are different. Theoretically, the influence of specific-heat ratio on the non-equilibrium effect is reflected in two aspects: transport coefficient and macroscopic quantity gradient. For example, on the one hand, the specific-heat ratio reduces heat conductivity, while on the other hand, it enhances the temperature gradient. Therefore, the effect of specific heat ratio on NOEF is the comprehensive result of the competition between the two aspects. As shown in Fig. , the smaller the specific-heat ratio, the stronger strength of D * 3,1 . It indicates that the specific-heat ratio increase the strength of D * 3,1 by raising the heat conductivity . For the strength of D * 3 , as shown in Fig. (b), it is seen that it decreases as the specific-heat ratio becomes small. The reason is that a smaller specific-heat ratio decreases the temperature gradient. Effects of specific-heat ratio on D * 4,2 show two-stage. In the shock compression stage (t < 0.03), the smaller specificheat ratio, the larger the strength of D * 4,2 . But the situation is reversed at the stage t > 0.03. For strength of D * 2 , the specificheat effects are more significant in later stage. Effects of specific-heat ratio on entropy production rate\n\nand entropy production The concepts of entropy are commonly used in complex flows . In DBM, there are two kinds of en- tropy production rates, i.e., \u1e60NOEF and \u1e60NOMF ."

      "Therefore, our calculation has two steps, similar to that in \\cite{hung14}. From the graphene bandstructures obtained using the tight-binding Hamiltonian above, we first look for the energy gaps $E_{unstrain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ and $E_{strain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ for a given $\\kappa_y$ of two graphene sections. The maximum of these energy gaps determines the gap $E_{junc}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ of transmission probability through the junction. Finally, the conduction gap $E_{cond.gap}$ is obtained by looking for the minimum value of $E_{junc}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ when varying $\\kappa_y$ in the whole Brillouin zone. In particular, the energy bands of strained graphene are given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n E\\left( {\\vec k} \\right) =  \\pm \\left| {{t_1}{e^{i\\vec k{{\\vec a}_1}}} + {t_2}{e^{i\\vec k{{\\vec a}_2}}} + {t_3}} \\right|\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere the plus/minus sign corresponds to the conduction/valence bands, respectively. For a given direction $\\phi$ of transport, in principle, the vectors $\\vec L_{x,y}$ defining the sizes of unit cell along the Ox and Oy directions, respectively, can be always expressed as ${\\vec L_x} = {n_1}{\\vec a_1} + {n_2}{\\vec a_2}$ and ${\\vec L_y} = {m_1}{\\vec a_1} + {m_2}{\\vec a_2}$ with $\\cos \\phi = \\frac{{{{\\vec L}_x}\\vec L_x^0}}{{{L_x}L_x^0}}$ and $\\sin \\phi = \\frac{{{{\\vec L}_x}\\vec L_y^0}}{{{L_x}L_y^0}}$ while $\\vec L_{x,y}^0 = {\\vec a_1} \\pm {\\vec a_2}$. Note that $n_{1,2}$ and $m_{1,2}$ are integers while $\\frac{{{m_1}}}{{{m_2}}} =  - \\frac{{{n_1} + 2{n_2}}}{{{n_2} + 2{n_1}}}$, i.e., ${\\vec L_{x}} {\\vec L_{y}} = 0$. In other words, we have the following expressions\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{{{\\vec a}_1} = \\frac{{ - {m_2}{{\\vec L}_x} + {n_2}{{\\vec L}_y}}}{{{n_2}{m_1} - {n_1}{m_2}}};\\,\\,\\,{{\\vec a}_2} = \\frac{{{m_1}{{\\vec L}_x} - {n_1}{{\\vec L}_y}}}{{{n_2}{m_1} - {n_1}{m_2}}}}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nOn this basis, the energy bands can be rewritten in terms of $\\kappa_{x, y} = \\vec k \\vec L_{x,y} \\left( { \\equiv {k_{x,y}}{L_{x,y}}} \\right)$ by substituting Eqs.",
      "(7) into Eq. (6). This new form of energy bands is finally used to compute the conduction gap of strained junctions. As a simple example, in the case of $\\phi = 0$ (armchair direction), we calculate the conduction gap as follows. First, Eq. (6) is rewritten in the form\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n E_{\\phi = 0}\\left( {\\vec \\kappa} \\right) =  \\pm \\left| {{t_1}{e^{i\\kappa_y/2}} + {t_2}{e^{ - i\\kappa_y/2}} + {t_3}{e^{ - i\\kappa_x/2}}} \\right|\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith the vectors $\\vec L_{x,y} \\equiv \\vec L_{x,y}^0$. Using this new form, the energy gap of strained graphene for a given $\\kappa_y$ is determined as\n\\begin{equation}\n{E_{strain}^{gap}}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right) = 2 \\left| {\\sqrt {{{\\left( {{t_1} - {t_2}} \\right)}^2} + 4{t_1}{t_2}{{\\cos }^2}\\frac{{{\\kappa_y}}}{2}}  + {t_3}} \\right|\n\\end{equation}\nwhile ${E_{unstrain}^{gap}}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ is given by the same formula with $t_1$ = $t_2$ = $t_3$ $\\equiv$ $t_0$. The gap of transmission probability through the junction is then determined as ${E_{junc}^{gap}}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right) = \\max \\left[ {E_{unstrain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right),E_{strain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)} \\right]$ and, finally, the conduction gap is given by ${E_{cond.gap}} = \\min \\left[ {E_{junc}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)} \\right]$ for $\\kappa_y$ in the whole Brillouin zone. We would like to notice that the Green's function calculations and the banstructure analyses give the same results of conduction gap in the junctions where the transition region between unstrained and strained graphene sections is long enough, i.e., larger than about 5 to 6 nm. In the case of short length, as discussed in \\cite{baha13,hung14}, this transition zone can have significant effects on the transmission between propagating states beyond the energy gaps and hence can slightly enlarge the gap of conductance, compared to the results obtained from the bandstructure calculations. \\section{Results and discussion}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.0in]{Fig02.pdf}\n\\caption{Dependence of graphene bandgap (in the unit of eV) on the applied strain and its direction: tensile (a) and compressive (b).",
      "The appearance of this conduction gap, as mentioned previously, is due to the strain-induced shift of Dirac points and is explained as follows. Actually, the strain causes the lattice deformation and can result in the deformation of graphene bandstructure. Therefore, the bandedges as a function of wave-vector $k_y$ in unstrained and strained graphene can be illustrated schematically as in the top panel of Fig. 4. As one can see, the shift of Dirac points leads to the situation where there is no value of $\\kappa_y$, for which the energy gaps $E_{unstrain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ and $E_{strain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ are simultaneously equal to zero. This means that the transmission probability always shows a finite gap for any $\\kappa_y$. For instance, the energy gap is zero (or small) in the unstrained (resp. strained) graphene section but finite in the strained (resp. unstrained) one in the vicinity of Dirac point $k_y = K_{unstrain}$ (resp. $K_{strain}$). Accordingly, as illustrated in the pictures of LDOS in the left panels of Fig. 4 and confirmed in the corresponding transmissions in the right panels, clear gaps of transmission are still obtained. Far from these values of $k_y$, $E_{unstrain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ and $E_{strain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ are both finite (e.g., see the LDOS plotted for $k_y = K_{gap}$) and hence a finite gap of transmission also occurs. On this basis, a finite gap of conductance is achieved. More important, Fig. 3 shows that besides the strength of strain, the strain effect is also strongly dependent on the applied direction. For instance, the conduction gap takes the values of $\\sim$ 295, 172 and 323 meV for $\\theta = 0$, $30^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$, respectively. Below, we will discuss the properties of the conduction gap with respect to the strain, its applied direction, and the direction of transport. Note that due to the lattice symmetry, the transport directions $\\phi$ and $\\phi + 60^\\circ$ are equivalent while the applied strain of angle $\\theta$ is identical to that of $\\theta + 180^\\circ$."

Mandate the approval of tentative subdivision maps\nfor residential housing projects that meet specified\nThis bill clarifies that in any action or proceeding\nbrought pursuant to the notice and accrual provisions of\nGovernment Code Section 65009 described above, neither the\ncourt remedies described above nor any injunction against\nthe development of a housing project shall abrogate,\nimpair, or otherwise interfere with the full exercise of\nthe rights and protections granted to an applicant for a\ntentative map or a vesting tentative map under specified\nprovisions of the Subdivision Map Act or to a developer\nunder a specified provision relating to development AB 602\nUnder current law, HCD operates a number of grant programs\nto which cities and counties may apply. In many cases, the\nlaw requires a city or county to have an HCD-approved\nhousing element in order to be eligible for funding. This bill provides that if a third-party challenges the\nadequacy of a housing element in court and the court finds\nthat the housing element substantially complies with all of\nthe requirements of housing element law, the element shall\nbe deemed to be in compliance for purposes of state housing\nThe statutory language interpreted by the court and at\nissue in this bill was added to statute by AB 998 (Waters),\nChapter 1138, Statutes of 1983, a bill sponsored by the\nLeague of California Cities and the California Building\nIndustry Association.",
      "In sum, a party bringing a challenge AB 602\ngoverned by section 65009, subdivision (d), has 90\ndays from the date a legislative action is taken or\napproval is given to notify the local land use\nauthority of any claimed deficiencies in such an\naction or approval. Its claim then accrues 60 days\nafter it gives this notice. In other words, instead of being able to initiate a\nchallenge to a deficient housing element at any time during\nthe planning period, housing advocates and other interested\nparties may now only initiate such a challenge by\nsubmitting a deficiency notice within 90 days of the\nhousing element\u2019s adoption.\n1.Removes from the current list of city or county actions\nwhich may be challenged pursuant to Government Code 65009\nnotice and accrual provisions those actions related to\nthe Housing Accountability Act, the Subdivision Map Act,\nand the application of a Density Bonus ordinance to a\nparticular project, all of which are project-specific\nactions. The bill maintains the ability to use these\nnotice and accrual provisions to challenge the adequacy\nof a city\u2019s or county\u2019s density bonus ordinance\n2.Extends lengthening the time in which a deficiency notice\nmay be served to cover all remaining city or county\nactions described in this section of law, as opposed to\njust housing element challenges. In other words, the\namendments apply the longer timeframe to serve the\ndeficiency notice to actions relating to the Least Cost\nZoning Law, annual limits on housing permits, and the\nadequacy of a density bonus ordinance, in addition to\nhousing element law. 3.Provides that an entity challenging such an action in\nsupport of affordable housing may serve the deficiency\nnotice up to five years after the city\u2019s or county\u2019s\naction. After 60 days or the date on which the city or\ncounty takes final action in response to the notice,\nwhichever occurs first, the challenging party has one\nyear to file an action in court, except that the lawsuit AB 602\nmay not be filed more than five years after the city\u2019s or\ncounty\u2019s action.",
      "The Least Cost Zoning Law, which requires cities and AB 602\ncounties to designate and zone sufficient vacant land for\nresidential use with appropriate standards to meet\nhousing needs for all income categories and to contribute\nto producing housing at the lowest possible cost.\n? A requirement that, when determining whether to approve a\ntentative subdivision map, a city or county shall apply\nonly those ordinances, policies, and standards in effect\nas of the date the developer\u2019s application is deemed\nPrior to a recent court decision, it was understood that\ncurrent law allowed a party to challenge the adequacy of a\ncity\u2019s or county\u2019s housing element at any time during a\nplanning period, provided that the challenger brought the\naction \u201cin support of or to encourage or facilitate the\ndevelopment of housing that would increase the community\u2019s\nsupply of [affordable] housing.\u201d The challenging party was\nrequired first to serve the city or county with a notice\nidentifying the deficiencies in the housing element. After\n60 days or the date on which the city or county took final\naction in response to the notice, whichever occurred first,\nthe challenging party had one year to file the action in\ncourt. This process and statute of limitations also\napplied to actions brought pursuant to the housing-related\nstatutes listed above. In 2006 Urban Habitat Program brought suit to challenge the\nCity of Pleasanton\u2019s housing policies, including the city\u2019s\nannual cap on housing permits and the city\u2019s cap on the\naggregate number of permissible housing units, both of\nwhich Urban Habitat claimed were insufficient to allow the\ncity to meet its RHNA obligation. In 2008, the First\nDistrict California Court of Appeals issued an unpublished\ndecision in the case of Urban Habitat Program v. City of\nPleasanton allowing the case to proceed with respect to\nsome causes of action, but ruling that the challenge to the\nhousing element itself was time-barred. The court stated:\nAlthough the statute does not specify the time within\nwhich [a deficiency] notice must be given, it is our\nconclusion that the statute must be interpreted as\ncontaining a time limit within which this requirement\nmust be met?"

      "Id. at 320 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). So the physical presence test remained the law of the land while the internet conquered the earth. Justice Kennedy had joined the Quill majority and Justice Scalia\u2019s concurring opinion emphasizing stare decisis, but by 2015 he had second thoughts. Writing separately in Direct Marketing Ass\u2019n v. Brohl,14\u00d7 14. 135 S. Ct. 1124 (2015).

Id.\nSeldom has a concurring opinion signed by a lone Justice prompted a state to officially declare an emergency. Yet in 2016, in response to Justice Kennedy\u2019s overture, the South Dakota legislature passed a law, S.B. 106, \u201cto provide for the collection of sales taxes from certain remote sellers . . . and to declare an emergency. \u201d17\u00d7 17. 2016 S.D.

      "South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. - Harvard Law Review\nFourth Circuit Invalidates Maryland Statute Regulating Price Gouging in the Sale of Generic Drugs. South Dakota Supreme Court Holds Unconstitutional State Law Requiring Internet Retailers Without In-State Physical Presence to Remit Sales Tax. Judicial junk, the Court has long thought, is easier to scrap when the erroneous precedent cannot be fixed by Congress, as in constitutional cases.1\u00d7 1. See Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 405\u201310 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); Lee Epstein, William M. Landes & Adam Liptak, The Decision to Depart (or Not) from Constitutional Precedent: An Empirical Study of the Roberts Court, 90 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1115, 1116 (2015) (\u201c[Justice Brandeis\u2019s] dissenting opinion . . . now has the status of black letter law.\u201d). On the flip side, whenever a bad precedent can be corrected by Congress, stare decisis applies with \u201cspecial force. \u201d2\u00d7 2. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 172\u201373 (1989). The Court, following Justice Brandeis, usually articulates the rule as distinguishing between \u201cconstitutional\u201d and \u201cstatutory\u201d precedents. See, e.g., id. But the distinction is occasionally said to be between \u201cconstitutional\u201d and \u201cnonconstitutional cases.\u201d See, e.g., Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 543 (1962) (plurality opinion). Nomenclature aside, the Court has \u2014 until now \u2014 adhered to Justice Brandeis\u2019s key insight that the important factor is whether or not the mistake may be legislatively corrected. Last Term, in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.,3\u00d7 3. 138 S. Ct. 2080 (2018). the Court tinkered with this thinking in overruling an outdated dormant commerce clause precedent. Dormant commerce clause decisions technically produce constitutional holdings, but Congress may override them at will.4\u00d7 4. See Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U.S. 408, 421\u201327 (1946). Under the usual logic of stare decisis, it should take special force to dislodge such precedents. But Wayfair applied the weakened stare decisis of constitutional cases, asserting that the Court must \u201caddress a false constitutional premise . . . .",
      "Id. at 2102 (quoting Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 279, 318 (1992)). while Justice Scalia had \u201crecogniz[ed] that stare decisis has \u2018special force\u2019 in the dormant Commerce Clause context due to Congress\u2019s \u2018final say over regulation of interstate commerce.\u2019\u201d48\u00d7 48. Id. (quoting Quill, 504 U.S. at 320 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment)). Moreover, \u201c[i]f stare decisis applied with special force in Quill, it should be an even greater impediment\u201d afterward since Quill effectively \u201ctossed [the ball] into Congress\u2019s court. \u201d49\u00d7 49. Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Kimble, 135 S. Ct. at 2409); cf. Bay Mills, 134 S. Ct. at 2039 n.12 (\u201cWhen we inform Congress that it has primary responsibility over a sphere of law, and invite Congress to consider a specific issue within that sphere, we cannot deem irrelevant how Congress responds.\u201d). Because the Court invited Congress to act and then \u201csuddenly chang[ed] the ground rules, the Court may have waylaid Congress\u2019s consideration of the issue. \u201d50\u00d7 50. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2102\u201303 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). In Wayfair, the Court applied the flimsier form of stare decisis to a precedent that could have been overruled by Congress. It did so in the context of a dormant commerce clause case, but Wayfair\u2019s logic extends to all constitutional default rules \u2014 that is, constitutional decisions that Congress remains free to change. Not only does Wayfair deviate from the Court\u2019s decades-old stare decisis analysis, it also imperils other precedents that set constitutional default rules. The Court\u2019s reasoning in Wayfair departs from its prior stare decisis analysis. In 1932, Justice Brandeis posited that stare decisis must bend \u201cin cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible.\u201d51\u00d7 51. Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 406\u201307 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). The Court has long since adopted his argument,52\u00d7 52. See, e.g., Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649, 665 (1944)."

We computed the security parameter, wall-time and physical footprint for each cryptographic primitive. Our attack model was based on a brute force searching via a parallelized version of Grover's algorithm, assuming a surface-code fault-tolerant architecture based on defects and braiding techniques. It is worth noting that throughout we are assuming that brute-force search where we treat the cryptographic function as a black-box is essentially the optimal attack against SHA and AES, which is currently believed to be the case. Some symmetric key algorithms are susceptible in a model that permits ``superposition attacks''~\\cite{quantph.1602.05973}. In most realistic instances, these attacks are not practical, however they do shed light on the limitations of certain security proof methods in a quantum context, and remind us that we shouldn't take for granted that non-trivial attacks on symmetric key cryptography may be possible.",

      "This paper investigates the effectiveness of medical meta-information for summarization tasks. We obtain four types of meta-information from the EHR systems and encode each meta-information into a sequence-to-sequence model. Using Japanese EHRs, meta-information encoded models increased ROUGE-1 by up to 4.45 points and BERTScore by 3.77 points over the vanilla Longformer. Also, we found that the encoded meta-information improves the precisions of its related terms in the outputs. Our results showed the benefit of the use of medical meta-information. INTRODUCTION\n\nClinical notes are written daily by physicians from their consults and are used for their own decision-making or coordination of treatment. They contain a large amount of important data for machine learning, such as conditions, laboratory tests, diagnoses, procedures, and treatments. While invaluable to physicians and researchers, the paperwork is burdensome for physicians , . Discharge summaries, a subset of these, also play a crucial role in patient care, and are used to share information between hospitals and physicians (see an example in Figure ). It is created by the physician as a summary of notes during hospitalization at the time of the patient's discharge, which is known to be very time-consuming. Researchers have begun to apply automatic summarization techniques to address this problem - . Previous studies used extractive or abstractive summarization methods, but most of them focused on only progress notes for inputs. Properly summarizing an admission of a patient is a quite complex task, and requires various meta-information such as the patient's age, gender, vital signs, laboratory values and background to specific diseases. Therefore, discharge summary generation needs more medical meta-information, than similar but narrower tasks such as radiology report generation. However, what kind of meta-information is important for summarization has not been investigated, even though it is critical not only for future research on medical summarization but also for the policy of data collection infrastructure.",
      "In this paper, we first reveal the effects of meta-information on neural abstractive summarization on admissions. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder transformer with an additional feature embedding layer in the encoder (Figure ). Hospital, physician, disease, and length of stay are used as meta-information, and each feature is embedded in the vector space. For experiments, we collect progress notes, discharge summaries and coded information from the electronic health record system, which are managed by a largest multi-hospital organization in Japan. Our main contributions are as follows: \u2022 We found that a transformer encoding meta-information generates higher quality summaries than the vanilla one, and clarified the benefit of using meta-information for medical summarization tasks. \u2022 We found that a model encoding disease information can produce proper disease and symptom words following the source. In addition, we found that the model using physician and hospital information can generate symbols that are commonly written in the summary. \u2022 We are the first to apply the abstractive summarization method to generate Japanese discharge summaries. In the studies of summarization of medical documents, it is common to retrieve key information such as disease, examination result, or medication from EHRs - . Other researchs more similar to our study targeted to help physicians get the point of medical documents quickly by generating a few key sentences - . Studies generating contextualized summaries can be categorized by the type of model inputs and architectures. Some studies produced a whole discharge summary using structured data for input - The sensitivity of the gram stain for bacterial meningitis is about 60%, and the sensitivity of the culture is not high either. Also, the glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid would have been slightly lower. Although no definitive diagnosis could be made, bacterial meningitis was the most suspicious disease. The causative organism was assumed to be MRSA, and vancomycin and meropenem (meningitis dose) were used to cover a wide range of enteric bacteria.",
      "In this study, we focused on words, not entities, because we wanted to visualize expressions that are not only nouns. The words were segmented by MeCab with the J-MeDic. For each segmented word, the numeral and symbol labels were assigned as parts of speech by MeCab, the morphological analyzer, while the disease and symptom were assigned by the J-Medic dictionary. The results, shown in Figure , indicate that the encoded disease information leads to generate more proper disease and symptom words. This indicates that the meta-information successfully learns disease-related expressions. The encoded hospital or physician information also improved the precision of symbols generation. This suggests that different hospitals and physicians have different description habits (e.g., bullet points such as \"\u2022\", \"*\" and \"-\", punctuation such as \"\u3002\" and \".\", etc.), which can be grouped by meta-information. In this paper, we conducted a discharge summary generation experiment by adding four types of information to Longformer and verified the impact of the meta-information. The results showed that all four types of information exceeded the performance of the vanilla Longformer model, with the highest performance achieved by encoding disease information. We found that meta-information is useful for abstractive summarization on discharge summaries. Our limitations are that we used Japanese EHR, the limited number of tested features and not performing human evaluations. As for the efficacy of the meta-information, we believe that our results are applicable to non-Japanese, but it is left as Fig. . The precisions of words in the generated summaries. The vertical axis shows the probability that the words exist in the gold summary. a future work. Other meta-information may be worth verifying such as the patient's gender, age, race, religion and used EHR system, etc. It is hard to collect a large amount of medical information and process it into meta-information, so we may need to develop a robust and flexible research infrastructure to conduct a more large scale cross-sectional study in the future."

Above 7 \\%, the magnetic signal mainly comes from nanocolumns and Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters. We can derive more information from ZFC-FC measurements (Fig. 14b). Indeed, for 2.3 \\% of Mn, ZFC and FC curves nearly superimpose down to low temperature meaning that nanocolumns are superparamagnetic in the whole temperature range. Moreover the weak irreversibility arising at 300 K  means that some Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters have already formed in the samples even at very low Mn concentrations. For 4 \\% of Mn, we can observe a peak with a maximum at the blocking temperature (12 K) in the ZFC curve. We can also derive the Curie temperature of nanocolumns: $\\approx$45 K. The irresversibility arising at 300 K still comes from Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters. Increasing the Mn concentration above 7 \\% leads to: higher blocking temperatures (20 K and 30 K) due to larger nanocolumns and wider ZFC peaks due to wider size distributions in agreement with TEM observations (see Fig. 3a).",
      "In Fig. 12b, in-plane and out-of-plane ZFC curves nearly superimpose for $T\\leq$150 K due to the isotropic magnetic behavior of the nanocolumns: in-plane magnetoelastic anisotropy is still compensating out-of-plane shape anisotropy.

This perpendicular anisotropy confirms the epitaxial relation: (0002) Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ $\\parallel$ (002) Ge discussed in Ref.\\cite{Bihl06}.

ZFC-FC irreversibility is observed up to the Curie temperature due to the presence of ferromagnetic columns.

      "$T_{B}>T_{C}$. Meanwhile Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters start to form.

The evolution of columns density as a fonction of Mn concentration is reported in figure 3b.

For Mn concentrations higher than 5 \\% the density seems to reach a plateau corresponding to 35000 $\\rm{\\mu m}^{-2}$ and their diameter slightly increases from 1.8 nm at 4 \\% to 2.8 nm at 11.3 \\%. By plotting the volume fraction occupied by the columns in the film as a function of Mn concentration, we observe a linear dependence for Mn contents below 5 \\%. The non-linear behavior above 5 \\% may indicate that the mechanism of Mn incorporation is different in this concentration range, leading to an increase of Mn concentration in the columns or in the matrix. For samples grown at 100$^\\circ$C, nanocolumns are always fully coherent with the surrounding matrix (Fig. 4a). Increasing the Mn content in the samples grown at 150$^\\circ$C from 1.3 \\% to 11.3 \\% leads to a decrease of the columns density (fig 3b).",
      "We clearly evidence the out-of-plane anisotropy of Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters and the isotropic magnetic behavior of nanocolumns (Fig. 13b). In this growth temperature range, we have also investigated the Mn concentration dependence of magnetic properties. \\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\center\n    \\includegraphics[width=.49\\linewidth]{./fig14a.eps}\n    \\includegraphics[width=.49\\linewidth]{./fig14b.eps} \n\\caption{Temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization (in $\\mu_{B}$/Mn) of Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films grown at 150$^{\\circ}$C plotted for different Mn concentrations: 2.3 \\%; 4 \\%; 7 \\%; 9 \\%; 11.3 \\%.

Above 7 \\%, the magnetic signal mainly comes from nanocolumns and Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters. We can derive more information from ZFC-FC measurements (Fig. 14b). Indeed, for 2.3 \\% of Mn, ZFC and FC curves nearly superimpose down to low temperature meaning that nanocolumns are superparamagnetic in the whole temperature range. Moreover the weak irreversibility arising at 300 K  means that some Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters have already formed in the samples even at very low Mn concentrations. For 4 \\% of Mn, we can observe a peak with a maximum at the blocking temperature (12 K) in the ZFC curve. We can also derive the Curie temperature of nanocolumns: $\\approx$45 K. The irresversibility arising at 300 K still comes from Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters. Increasing the Mn concentration above 7 \\% leads to: higher blocking temperatures (20 K and 30 K) due to larger nanocolumns and wider ZFC peaks due to wider size distributions in agreement with TEM observations (see Fig. 3a).",
      "In summary, in a wide range of growth temperatures and Mn concentrations, we have evidenced a two-dimensional spinodal decomposition leading to the formation of Mn-rich nanocolumns in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films. This decomposition is probably the consequence of: $(i)$ a strong pair attraction between Mn atoms, $(ii)$ a strong surface diffusion of Mn atoms in germanium even at low growth temperatures and $(iii)$ layer by layer growth conditions. We have also investigated the influence of growth parameters on the spinodal decomposition: at low growth temperatures (100$^{\\circ}$C), increasing the Mn content leads to higher columns densities while at higher growth temperatures (150$^{\\circ}$C), the columns density remains nearly constant whereas their size increases drastically. By plotting the nanocolumns density as a function of Mn content, we have shown that the mechanism of Mn incorporation in Ge changes above 5 \\% of Mn. Finally, using TEM observations and x-ray diffraction, we have shown that Ge$_3$Mn$_5$ nanoclusters start to form at growth temperatures higher than 160$^\\circ$C.\n\n\\section{Magnetic properties \\label{magnetic}}\n\nWe have thoroughly investigated the magnetic properties of thin Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films for different growth temperatures and Mn concentrations. In this section, we focus on Mn concentrations between 2 \\% and 11 \\%. We could clearly identify four different magnetic phases in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films : diluted Mn atoms in the germanium matrix, low $T_{C}$ nanocolumns ($T_{C}$ $\\leq$ 170 K), high $T_{C}$ nanocolumns ($T_{C}$ $\\geq$ 400 K) and Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters ($T_{C}$ $\\thickapprox$ 300 K). The relative weight of each phase clearly depends on the growth temperature and to a lesser extend on Mn concentration. For low growth temperature ($<$ 120$^{\\circ}$C), we show that nanocolumns are actually made of four uncorrelated superparamagnetic nanostructures. Increasing T$_{g}$ above 120$^{\\circ}$C, we first obtain continuous columns exhibiting low $T_{C}$ ($<$ 170 K) and high $T_{C}$ ($>$ 400 K) for $T_{g}\\approx$130$^{\\circ}$C.

      "Phylloquinone has a phytyl side chain. The MK-4 form of vitamin K2 is produced by conversion of vitamin K1 in the testes, pancreas, and arterial walls.[22] While major questions still surround the biochemical pathway for this transformation, the conversion is not dependent on gut bacteria, as it occurs in germ-free rats[23][24] and in parenterally-administered K1 in rats.[25][26] In fact, tissues that accumulate high amounts of MK-4 have a remarkable capacity to convert up to 90% of the available K1 into MK-4.[27][28] There is evidence that the conversion proceeds by removal of the phytyl tail of K1 to produce menadione as an intermediate, which is then condensed with an activated geranylgeranyl moiety (see also prenylation) to produce vitamin K2 in the MK-4 (menatetrione) form.[29]\nVitamin K2[edit]\nMain article: Vitamin K2\nVitamin K2 (menaquinone) includes several subtypes. The two subtypes most studied are menaquinone-4 (menatetrenone, MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7). Vitamin K1, the precursor of most vitamin K in nature, is a stereoisomer of phylloquinone, an important chemical in green plants, where it functions as an electron acceptor in photosystem I during photosynthesis. For this reason, vitamin K1 is found in large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green leaves, and dark green leafy vegetables such as romaine lettuce, kale and spinach), but it occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues (roots, fruits, etc.). Iceberg lettuce contains relatively little. The function of phylloquinone in plants appears to have no resemblance to its later metabolic and biochemical function (as \"vitamin K\") in animals, where it performs a completely different biochemical reaction. Vitamin K (in animals) is involved in the carboxylation of certain glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. The modified residues are often (but not always) situated within specific protein domains called Gla domains. Gla residues are usually involved in binding calcium, and are essential for the biological activity of all known Gla proteins.[30]\nAt this time[update], 17 human proteins with Gla domains have been discovered, and they play key roles in the regulation of three physiological processes:\nBlood coagulation: prothrombin (factor II), factors VII, IX, and X, and proteins C, S, and Z[31]\nBone metabolism: osteocalcin, also called bone Gla protein (BGP), matrix Gla protein (MGP),[32] periostin,[33] and the recently discovered Gla-rich protein (GRP).[34][35]\nVascular biology: growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6)[36]\nUnknown function: proline-rich \u03b3-carboxyglutamyl proteins (PRGPs) 1 and 2, and transmembrane \u03b3-carboxy glutamyl proteins (TMGs) 3 and 4.[37]\nLike other lipid-soluble vitamins (A, D and E), vitamin K is stored in the fatty tissue of the human body.",
      "All forms of K2 other than MK-4 can only be produced by bacteria, which use these forms in anaerobic respiration. The MK-7 and other bacterially derived forms of vitamin K2 exhibit vitamin K activity in animals, but MK-7's extra utility over MK-4, if any, is unclear and is a matter of investigation. Three synthetic types of vitamin K are known: vitamins K3, K4, and K5. Although the natural K1 and all K2 homologues and synthetic K4 and K5 have proven nontoxic, the synthetic form K3 (menadione) has shown toxicity.[2]\n1.2 Cardiovascular health\n1.4 Coumarin poisoning\n4.1 Conversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2\n4.2 Vitamin K2\n6 Absorption and dietary need\n7 Dietary reference intake\n10 Biochemistry\n10.1 Function in animals\n10.2 Gamma-carboxyglutamate proteins\n10.3 Methods of assessment\n10.4 Function in bacteria\n11 Injection in newborns\n11.3 Controversy\nA review of 2014 concluded that there is positive evidence that monotherapy using MK-4, one of the forms of Vitamin K2, reduces fracture incidence in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, and suggested further research on the combined use of MK-4 with bisphosphonates. In contrast, an earlier review article of 2013 concluded that there is no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation helps prevent osteoporosis or fractures in postmenopausal women.[3]\nA Cochrane systematic review of 2006 suggested that supplementation with Vitamin K1 and with MK4 reduces bone loss; in particular, a strong effect of MK-4 on incident fractures among Japanese patients was emphasized.[4]\nA review article of 2016 suggested to consider, as one of several measures for bone health, increasing the intake of foods rich in vitamins K1 and K2.[5]\nCardiovascular health[edit]\nAdequate intake of vitamin K is associated with the inhibition of arterial calcification and stiffening,[6] but there have been few interventional studies and no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation is of any benefit in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.[7]\nOne 10-year population study, the Rotterdam Study, did show a clear and significant inverse relationship between the highest intake levels of menaquinone (mainly MK-4 from eggs and meat, and MK-8 and MK-9 from cheese) and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in older men and women.[8]\nVitamin K has been promoted in supplement form with claims it can slow tumor growth; there is however no good medical evidence that supports such claims.[9]\nCoumarin poisoning[edit]\nVitamin K is part of the suggested treatment regime for poisoning by rodenticide (coumarin poisoning).[10]\nAlthough allergic reaction from supplementation is possible, no known toxicity is associated with high doses of the phylloquinone (vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of vitamin K, so no tolerable upper intake level (UL) has been set.[11]\nBlood clotting (coagulation) studies in humans using 45 mg per day of vitamin K2 (as MK-4)[12] and even up to 135 mg per day (45 mg three times daily) of K2 (as MK-4),[13] showed no increase in blood clot risk.",
      "It was shown that, while warfarin-treated cows had a form of prothrombin that contained 10 glutamate (Glu) amino acid residues near the amino terminus of this protein, the normal (untreated) cows contained 10 unusual residues that were chemically identified as \u03b3-carboxyglutamate (Gla). The extra carboxyl group in Gla made clear that vitamin K plays a role in a carboxylation reaction during which Glu is converted into Gla. The biochemistry of how vitamin K is used to convert Glu to Gla has been elucidated over the past thirty years in academic laboratories throughout the world. ^ \"Vitamin K Overview\".

      "\\section{Introduction}\nGiven a data set and a model with some unknown parameters, the inverse problem aims to find the values of the model parameters that best fit the data. In this work, in which we focus on systems of interacting elements,\n the inverse problem concerns  the statistical inference\n of the underling interaction network and of its coupling coefficients from observed data on the dynamics  of the system. Versions of this problem are encountered in physics, biology (e.g., \\cite{Balakrishnan11,Ekeberg13,Christoph14}), social sciences and finance (e.g.,\\cite{Mastromatteo12,yamanaka_15}), neuroscience (e.g., \\cite{Schneidman06,Roudi09a,tyrcha_13}), just to cite a few, and are becoming more and more important due to the increase in the amount of data available from these fields.\\\\\n \\indent \n A standard approach used in statistical inference is to predict the interaction couplings by maximizing the likelihood function. This technique, however, requires the evaluation of the  \n \n   partition function that, in the most general case, concerns a number of computations scaling exponentially with the system size. Boltzmann machine learning uses Monte Carlo sampling to compute the gradients of the Log-likelihood looking for stationary points \\cite{Murphy12} but this method is computationally manageable only for small systems. A series of faster approximations, such as naive mean-field, independent-pair approximation \\cite{Roudi09a, Roudi09b}, inversion of TAP equations \\cite{Kappen98,Tanaka98}, small correlations expansion \\cite{Sessak09}, adaptive TAP \\cite{Opper01}, adaptive  cluster expansion \\cite{Cocco12} or Bethe approximations \\cite{Ricci-Tersenghi12, Nguyen12}  have, then, been developed. These techniques take as input means and correlations of observed variables and most of them assume a fully connected graph as underlying connectivity network, or expand  around it by perturbative dilution. In most cases, network reconstruction turns out to  be not accurate for small data sizes and/or when couplings are  strong or, else, if the original interaction network is sparse.\\\\\n\\indent\n A further method, substantially improving performances for small data, is the so-called Pseudo-Likelyhood Method (PLM) \\cite{Ravikumar10}.",
      "The temperature behaviour of ${\\rm err_J}$ agrees with the one already observed for Ising spins in \\cite{Nguyen12b} and for XY spins  in \\cite{Tyagi15} with a mean-field approach:  ${\\rm err_J}$ displays a minimum around $T\\simeq 1$ and then it increases for very lower $T$; however,\n the error obtained with the PLM with decimation is several times smaller  than the error estimated by the other methods.\n\n\n\n \n \n\n     \n     \\section{Conclusions}\n     \\label{sec:conc}\n\n\nDifferent statistical inference methods have been applied to the inverse problem of the XY model. After a short review of techniques based on pseudo-likelihood and their formal generalization to the model we have tested their performances against data generated by means of Monte Carlo numerical simulations of known instances\nwith diluted, sparse, interactions. The main outcome is that the best performances are obtained by means of the  pseudo-likelihood method combined with decimation. Putting to zero (i.e., decimating) very weak bonds, this technique turns out to be very precise for  problems whose real underlying interaction network is sparse, i.e., the number of couplings per variable does not scale with number of variables. The PLM + decimation method is compared to the PLM + regularization method, with $\\ell_2$ regularization and to a mean-field-based method. The behavior of the quality of the network reconstruction is analyzed by looking at the overall sorted couplings and at the single site couplings, comparing them with the real network, and at the true positive curves in all three approaches. In the PLM +decimation method, moreover, the identification of the number of decimated bonds at which the tilted pseudo-likelihood is maximum allows for a precise estimate of the total number of bonds. Concerning this technique, it is also shown that the network with the most likely number of bonds is also the one of least reconstruction error, where not only the prediction of the presence of a bond is estimated but also its value.",
      "In Ref. \\cite{Aurell12} Aurell and Ekeberg performed a comparison between PLM and some of the just mentioned mean-field-based algorithms on the pairwise interacting Ising-spin  ($\\sigma = \\pm 1$) model, showing how PLM performs sensitively better, especially on sparse graphs and in the high-coupling limit, i.e., for low temperature. In this work, we aim at performing statistical inference  on a model whose interacting variables are continuous $XY$ spins, i.e., $\\sigma \\equiv \\left(\\cos \\phi,\\sin \\phi\\right)$ with $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi ) $. The developed tools can, actually, be also straightforward applied  to the $p$-clock model  \\cite{Potts52} where the phase $\\phi$ takes discretely equispaced $p$ values  in the $2 \\pi$ interval, $\\phi_a =  a 2 \\pi/p$, with $a= 0,1,\\dots,p-1$. The $p$-clock model, else called vector Potts model, gives a hierarchy of discretization of the $XY$ model as $p$ increases. For $p=2$, one recovers the Ising model, for $p=4$ the Ashkin-Teller model \\cite{Ashkin43}, for $p=6$ the ice-type model \\cite{Pauling35,Baxter82} and the eight-vertex model \\cite{Sutherland70,Fan70,Baxter71} for $p=8$.  \nIt turns out to be very useful also for numerical implementations of the continuous $XY$ model. Recent analysis on the multi-body $XY$ model has shown that for a limited number of discrete phase values ($p\\sim 16, 32$) the thermodynamic critical properties of the $p\\to\\infty$ $XY$ limit are promptly recovered \\cite{Marruzzo15, Marruzzo16}. Our main motivation to study statistical inference is that these kind of models have recently turned out to be rather useful in describing the behavior of optical systems, \nincluding standard mode-locking lasers \\cite{Gordon02,Gat04,Angelani07,Marruzzo15} and random lasers \\cite{Angelani06a,Leuzzi09a,Antenucci15a,Antenucci15b,Marruzzo16}. In particular, the inverse problem on the pairwise XY model analyzed here might be of help in recovering images from light propagated through random media.

If p is even, then the residual terms are given by where \u03c6 and \u03c6 (1) denote the digamma function and its derivative. If p is odd, similar remainder terms can be derived. To see that R i (l, p) = O(p \u22121 ) for i = 1, 2, 3 and uniformly in l we use that asymptotically \u03c6(x)\u223c log(x)\u22121/(2x) and\nThe mixed term are both of the order p \u22121 .

To show that a i a j 2p\u22122 r=1 \u03bb r c(i, r)c(j, r) = O(p \u22121 ), we proceed similarly as before. Setting k=r\u22121, l=j\u22121, m=i\u22121 and using that l =m and |l\u2212m| is even, one obtains where for even p the residual terms are given by If p is odd, analogous residual terms can be derived. Using similar techniques as before, one can show that the two residual terms and the remaining mixed and square terms vanish at a rate of the order O(p \u22121 ) and uniformly in i, j. Case i = j and |i \u2212 j| is odd |r \u2212 i| and |r \u2212 j| are either odd and even, or even and odd. Without loss of generality, assume that |r \u2212 i| is even.

Thus, for 0 < t < a and t independent of a, equation (A.17) implies for a \u2192 \u221e that \u0393(a + t)/\u0393(a) = O(a t ). Similarly, it can be seen that \u0393(a \u2212 t)/\u0393(a) = O(a \u2212t ). If 0 < t < a and t linearly depends on a, i.e. t = ca for some constant c \u2208 (0, 1), then we get \u0393(a \u00b1 t)/\u0393(a) = O(a \u00b1t exp{a}) for a \u2192 \u221e.\nHence, for a fixed \u03bb not depending on n, p and such that 0 < \u03bb < m/( \u221a 2M j ) we get for sufficiently large n, p If \u03bb = cm such that 0 < \u03bb < m/( \u221a 2M j ), then for sufficiently large n, p b\u2208{c\u03b4/m,cM 0 /m} (bm/2) for some constant L > 1.

The factor (\u03b6 k + \u03be k ) can be considered as stochastic weights that do not affect the piecewise linear property.

      "Apart from completion time, the remaining metrics, based on the commands passed to the vehicular actuators (Fig. ), are used to model passenger comfort. In terms of average performance, SLAS greatly outperforms the other methods when it comes to passenger comfort since it explicitly accounts for comfort in the formulation. However, it does so at a cost of slightly reduced performance in regards to travel time, when compared to EA , since SLAS tries to strike a balance between minimizing travel time and maximizing passenger comfort. SLAS also secures the lowest standard deviation, for each of the evaluation metrics, when compared to the other methods, which points to the consistency in its long-term performance. CONCLUSION We propose a novel behavior planning module for the multi-lane highway maneuvering scenario, that outputs strategic target lane and reference speed commands, and incorporate it with a state-of-the-art motion planning and control framework. We formulate the approach as a receding horizon mixed integer optimization with the goal to minimize travel time while accounting for passenger comfort for a long planning horizon. In order to reduce the computational overload, we reformulate the problem by replacing integer variables with binary ones and further incorporate various modifications to aid numerical computations. We also carry out a detailed comparative analysis to demonstrate the performance of our approach on the CARLA simulator. Our future work includes incorporating various delays and uncertainty measures in the perception, localization and prediction modules to evaluate the robustness properties of our approach. Flooring Constraint\n\nFor y \u2208 Z and x \u2208 R, the constraint y = x can be represented by the following linear constraints: y \u2264 x, y + 1 \u2265 x + where > 0 accounts for the feasibility tolerance. where M 0 (big-M) and > 0 accounts for numerical errors (chosen to be 0.1 in our implementations). Absolute Value Constraint\n\nFor \u2206s, L s \u2208 R, the constraint |\u2206s| \u2212 L s \u2265 0 can be represented as: This can further be generalized, as done in our implementation, to have different forward and rear safety margins as: \u2206s \u2265",
      "We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in contrast to the existing methods, when applied in conjunction with state-of-the-art trajectory generation and trajectory following frameworks, in a CARLA simulation environment. INTRODUCTION\n\nLane changing is considered to be one of the most risky driving behaviors since it is highly contingent upon multimodal trajectory predictions of neighboring vehicles and requires timely decision making . It is further influenced by a number of uncertainty factors such as road conditions, measurement accuracy, and a long tail of behavioral uncertainty of on-road agents. However, if executed efficiently, lane changing coupled with speed adjustment can yield significant improvement in minimizing overall travel time while ensuring passenger comfort . To elaborate further, consider the scenario presented in Fig. . Based on the predicted motion (shown in a lighter shade) of the neighboring vehicles (shown in orange), the ego vehicle (shown in blue) may decide to either change lane left in an attempt to minimize its travel time or slow down in the current lane to maintain safety. However, it would be imprudent for the ego vehicle to risk changing lane right and consequently get stuck behind a slow moving vehicle even though there is presently a greater headway. This simple scenario highlights the importance of foresight and long planning-horizon in strategic decision making for autonomous vehicles. Existing methods like MOBIL give us the ability to change lanes but behave greedily (prioritizing immediate rewards) oftentimes, which can lead to sub-optimal performance. It was shown in that the lane changing performance can be improved with an A inspired approach, but the formulation was limited to constant speed. Such an approach is unable to assess the benefits of speed adjustment 1 University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA. Email: {mftariq,baras}@umd.edu. 2 Honda Research Institute, San Jose, CA, USA.

      "The values of these parameters can be tuned to yield an aggressive or defensive behavior of the algorithm. 1) Travel Time: The left plot in Fig. depicts the travel time as a function of longitudinal displacement for the four algorithms. As seen in the plot, our method (SLAS) maintains a lower overall travel time as compared to the other methods. Quantitatively speaking, SLAS outperforms EA , MOBIL and No-change methods by 12.72%, 23.52% and 54.34% respectively in terms of the time required to complete the simulation scenario. This shows that our method's foresight compensates for its apparent conservativeness arising from the need to preserve passenger comfort. 2) Lateral Displacement: To identify the differences in lane changing behaviors between the four approaches, the relationship between lateral and longitudinal displacements over the course of the simulation is highlighted in the center plot of Fig. . In the plot, the lateral displacement of 0 corresponds to the center of lane 0 while the center of each following lane is 3.5m away. Comparing the performance of the four algorithms, we see SLAS and EA showing relatively similar performances, resulting from proactive decision making. In contrast, since MOBIL only assesses the advantage of switching to the adjacent lanes, it is unable to see the benefit of proactively switching to lane 2. This explains why EA and SLAS start outperforming MOBIL in terms of travel time (left plot) at around the 130 [m] mark for longitudinal displacement. As for a direct comparison between SLAS and EA , the benefits of having speed advisory system become apparent in this center plot. Due to speed control, SLAS is able to constantly maintain a greater headway (right plot) without having to brake significantly upon getting too close to the lead vehicle. This results in a smooth lateral displacement profile which allows the vehicle to change lanes with minimal jerk (quantitative analysis to follow in Section IV-C) and deliver better overall timing performance (left plot).",
      "3) Headway: The right plot in Fig. shows the headway maintained by the ego vehicle over the course of the simulation. In accordance with our prior discussion, MOBIL cruises behind the front vehicle, maintaining a relatively low headway until a sufficient space in the adjacent lane is found to perform the lane-change maneuver. On the other hand, EA and SLAS show a comparable headway trajectory, however, SLAS maintains a greater headway throughout and achieves the maximum headway prior to EA . Quantitatively, SLAS maintains on average 9.43%, 36.57% and 113.17% more headway than the EA , MOBIL and No-change approaches respectively. This strong performance by SLAS can be attributed to its incorporation of safety guarantees coupled with its consideration for passenger comfort. 4) Distance to closest vehicle: Finally, we compare the distance that ego vehicle maintains from the closest vehicle throughout the simulation. On average, SLAS maintains 9.28%, 32.01%, and 22.84% more distance in comparison to EA , MOBIL and No-change approaches respectively. These numbers are a testament to the strength of our approach resulting from consideration of long planning horizon coupled with speed control. Monte Carlo Simulations\n\nTo demonstrate the long-term performance of the three approaches (SLAS, EA and MOBIL), we run a series of Monte Carlo simulations on scenarios with randomized initial positions (within a range of 8m) and velocities (within    ranges of 8, 5 and 2 m/s assigned to each of the three lanes randomly) of traffic participants. The result from 50 simulations is presented in Table . In this table, the columns represent the different evaluation metrics, the rows identify the three algorithms, and the values highlighted in green represent the best result with respect to each evaluation metric. The evaluation metrics, going from left to right in the table, are completion time (s), brake (R [\u22121,0] ), brake jerk (R [\u22121,0] ), throttle (R [0,1] ), throttle jerk (R [0,1] ), angular acceleration ( \u2022 /s 2 ) and angular jerk ( \u2022 /s 3 )."

      "Dashed line is for in-plane susceptibility and solid line for out-of-plane susceptibility.}\n\\label{fig11}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn Fig. 11, the best fits lead to $M\\approx$1250 $\\mu_{B}$ and $\\mu_{0}H_{eff}\\approx$102 mT for in-plane susceptibility and $M\\approx$1600 $\\mu_{B}$ and $\\mu_{0}H_{eff}\\approx$98 mT for out-of-plane susceptibility. It gives an average magnetic moment of 1425 $\\mu_{B}$ per column and an effective interaction field of 100 mT. Using this magnetic moment and its temperature dependence, magnetization curves could be fitted using a Langevin function and $M(H/T)$ curves superimpose for $T<$100 K. However, from the saturated magnetic moment of the columns and their density (35000 $\\rm{\\mu m}^{-2}$), we find almost 6000 $\\mu_{B}$ per column. Therefore, for low growth temperatures, we need to assume that nanocolumns are actually made of almost four independent elongated magnetic nanostructures. The effective field for antiferromagnetic interactions between nanostructures estimated from the susceptibility fits is at least one order of magnitude larger than what is expected from pure magnetostatic coupling. This difference may be due to either an additional antiferromagnetic coupling through the matrix which origin remains unexplained or to the mean field approximation which is no more valid in this strong coupling regime. As for magnetic anisotropy, the nanostructures behave as isotropic magnetic systems or exhibit a cubic magnetic anisotropy. First we can confirm that nanostructures are not amorphous otherwise shape anisotropy would dominate leading to out-of-plane anisotropy. We can also rule out a random distribution of magnetic easy axes since the nanostructures are clearly crystallized in the diamond structure and would exhibit at least a cubic anisotropy (except if the random distribution of Mn atoms within the nanostructures can yield random easy axes). Since the nanostructures are in strong in-plane compression (their lattice parameter is larger than the matrix one), the cubic symmetry of the diamond structure is broken and magnetic cubic anisotropy is thus unlikely.",
      "We rather believe that out-of-plane shape anisotropy is nearly compensated by in-plane magnetoelastic anisotropy due to compression leading to a \\textit{pseudo} cubic anisotropy. From the blocking temperature (15 K) and the magnetic volume of the nanostructures , we can derive their magnetic anisotropy constant using $Kv=25k_{B}T_{B}$: K$\\approx$10 kJ.m$^{-3}$ which is of the same order of magnitude as shape anisotropy. \\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\center\n    \\includegraphics[width=.35\\linewidth]{./fig12a.eps}\n    \\includegraphics[width=.63\\linewidth]{./fig12b.eps} \n\\caption{(a) ZFC-FC measurements performed on a Ge$_{0.93}$Mn$_{0.07}$ sample grown at 122$^{\\circ}$C.

As we can see, SQUID measurements are much more sensitive to the presence of Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters, even at low concentration, than TEM and x-ray diffraction used in section \\ref{structural}. We also observe a sharp transition in the ZFC curve (see Fig. 7b, Fig. 12a and 12b): the peak becomes very large and is shifted towards high blocking temperatures (the signal is maximum at $T=$23 K). This can be easily understood as a magnetic percolation of the four independent nanostructures obtained at low growth temperatures into a single magnetic nanocolumn. Therefore the magnetic volume increases sharply as well as blocking temperatures. At the same time, the size distribution widens as observed in TEM. In Fig. 12a, we have performed ZFC-FC measurements at different $T_{0}$ temperatures. The ZFC-FC irreversibility is observed up to the Curie temperature of $\\approx$120 K meaning that a fraction of nanocolumns is ferromagnetic (\\textit{i.e.} $T_{B}\\geq T_{C}$).",
      "Moreover for low $T_{0}$ values, a peak appears at low temperature in FC curves which evidences strong antiferromagnetic interactions between the nanocolumns \\cite{Chan00}. \\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\center\n    \\includegraphics[width=.35\\linewidth]{./fig10a.eps}\n    \\includegraphics[width=.63\\linewidth]{./fig10b.eps}\n\\caption{(a) ZFC-FC measurements performed on a Ge$_{0.887}$Mn$_{0.113}$ sample grown at 115$^{\\circ}$C.

(b) ZFC-FC curves for in-plane and out-of-plane applied fields (0.015 T).}\n\\label{fig10}\n\\end{figure} In order to derive the magnetic size and anisotropy of the Mn-rich nanocolumns embedded in the Ge matrix, we have fitted the inverse normalized in-plane (resp. out-of-plane) susceptibility: $\\chi_{\\parallel}^{-1}$ (resp. $\\chi_{\\perp}^{-1}$). The corresponding experimental ZFC-FC curves are reported in Fig. 10b. Since susceptibility measurements are performed at low field (0.015 T), the matrix magnetic signal remains negligible. In order to normalize susceptibility data, we need to divide the magnetic moment by the saturated magnetic moment recorded at 5 T. However the matrix magnetic signal becomes very strong at 5 T and low temperature so that we need to subtract it from the saturated magnetic moment using a simple Curie function. From Fig. 10b, we can conclude that nanocolumns are isotropic. Therefore to fit experimental data we use the following expression well suited for isotropic systems or cubic anisotropy: $\\chi_{\\parallel}^{-1}= \\chi_{\\perp}^{-1}\\approx 3k_{B}T/M(T)+\\mu_{0}H_{eff}(T)$. $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $M=M_{s}v$ is the magnetic moment of a single-domain nanostructure (macrospin approximation) where $M_{s}$ is its magnetization and $v$ its volume. The in-plane magnetic field is applied along $[110]$ or $[-110]$ crystal axes. Since the nanostructures Curie temperature does not exceed 170 K, the temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization is also accounted for by writting $M(T)$. Antiferromagnetic interactions between nanostructures are also considered by adding an effective field estimated in the mean field approximation \\cite{Fruc02}: $\\mu_{0}H_{eff}(T)$.\nThe only fitting parameters are the maximum magnetic moment (\\textit{i.e.} at low temperature) per nanostructure: $M$ (in Bohr magnetons $\\mu_{B}$) and the maximum interaction field (\\textit{i.e.} at low temperature): $\\mu_{0}H_{eff}$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\center\n   \\includegraphics[width=.7\\linewidth]{./fig11.eps}\n\\caption{Temperature dependence of the inverse in-plane (open circles) and out-of-plane (open squares) normalized susceptibilities of a Ge$_{0.887}$Mn$_{0.113}$ sample grown at 115$^{\\circ}$C.

      "$T_{B}>T_{C}$. Meanwhile Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters start to form.

Here, we see a clear consequence of the higher-order dependence of Penning fraction - and thus the NO$^+$ ion - NO$^*$ Rydberg molecule balance - on $n_0$, the $\\omega_2$-selected Rydberg gas initial principal quantum number. This Penning-regulated NO$^+$ ion - NO$^*$ Rydberg molecule balance appears necessary as a critical factor in achieving the long ultracold plasma lifetime required to produce this signal. We are progressing in theoretical work that explains the stability apparently conferred by this balance.  \n\n\n\\subsection{Bifurcation and arrested relaxation}\n\nAmbipolar expansion quenches electron kinetic energy as the initially formed plasma expands. Core ions follow electrons into the wings of the Rydberg gas. There, recurring charge exchange between NO$^+$ ions and NO$^*$ Rydberg molecules redistributes the ambipolar force of the expanding electron gas, equalizing ion and Rydberg velocities. This momentum matching effectively channels electron energy through ion motion into the overall $\\pm x$ motion of gas volumes in the laboratory. The internal kinetic energy of the plasma, which at this point is defined almost entirely by the ion-Rydberg relative motion, falls. Spatial correlation develops, and over a period of 500 ns, the system forms the plasma/high-Rydberg quasi-equilibrium dramatically evidenced by the SFI results in Figure \\ref{fig:SFI}. \\begin{figure}[h!] \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width= .4 \\textwidth]{Bifurcation.pdf}\n   \\caption{$x,y$ detector images of ultracold plasma volumes produced by 2:1 aspect ratio ellipsoidal Rydberg gases with selected initial state, $40f(2)$ after a flight time of 402 $\\mu$s over a distance of 575 mm.

Our experiment crosses a 2 mm wide cylindrically Gaussian molecular beam with a 1 mm diameter TEM$_{00}$ $\\omega_1$ laser beam to produce a Gaussian ellipsoidal distribution of molecules excited to the A $^2\\Sigma^+$ $v=0, ~N'=0$ intermediate state. A larger diameter $\\omega_2$ pulse then drives a second step that forms a Rydberg gas in a single $n_0f(2)$ state with the spatial distribution of the intermediate state. We model this shaped Rydberg gas as a system of 100 concentric ellipsoidal shells of varying density \\cite{haenelCP}.",
      "In the wings, momentum redistribution owing to cycles of ion-Rydberg charge transfer retards radial expansion \\cite{Pohl2003,PPR}. By redirecting electron energy from ambipolar acceleration to $\\pm x$ plasma motion, NO$^+$ to NO$^*$ charge exchange dissipates electron thermal energy. This redistribution of energy released in the avalanche of the Rydberg gas to plasma, causes the ellipsoidal Rydberg gas to bifurcate \\cite{Schulz-Weiling2016,Haenel2017}, forming very long-lived, separating charged-particle distributions. We capture the electron signal from these recoiling volumes on an imaging detector as pictured in Figure \\ref{fig:bifurcation}. Here, momentum matching preserves density and enables ions and Rydberg molecules to relax to positions that minimize potential energy, building spatial correlation. The semi-classical description of avalanche and relaxation outlined above forms an important point of reference from which to interpret our experimental observations. The laser crossed molecular beam illumination geometry creates a Rydberg gas with a distinctively shaped high-density spatial distribution. This initial condition has an evident effect on the evolution dynamics. We have developed semi-classical models that explicitly consider the coupled rate and hydrodynamic processes governing the evolution from Rydberg gas to plasma using a realistic, ellipsoidal representation of the ion/electron and Rydberg densities \\cite{haenelCP}. No combination of initial conditions can produce a simulation that conforms classically with the state of arrested relaxation we observe experimentally. \\subsection{A molecular ultracold plasma state of arrested relaxation} Thus, we find that spontaneous avalanche to plasma splits the core of an ellipsoidal Rydberg gas of nitric oxide. As ambipolar expansion quenches the electron temperature of this core plasma, long-range, resonant charge transfer from ballistic ions to frozen Rydberg molecules in the wings of the ellipsoid quenches the ion-Rydberg molecule relative velocity distribution.",
      "This causes mixing with core penetrating states that are strongly dissociative. Penning partners are thus very likely to dissociate, leaving a spatially isolated distribution of ions. We refer to the spatial correlation that results as a Penning lattice \\cite{Sadeghi:2014}. The extent of this effect varies depending on the local density and the selected initial principal quantum number. Figure \\ref{fig:PL} shows the degree to which Rydberg gases with initial principal quantum numbers from 30 to 80 form a Penning lattice for an initial density of $1 \\times 10^{12} ~{\\rm cm}^{-3}$.  \n\n\\subsection{Spontaneous electron-impact avalanche}\n\nThe electrons produced by prompt Penning ionization start an electron impact avalanche. The kinetics of this process are well described by a set of coupled rate equations that account for state-to-state electron-Rydberg inelastic scattering, electron-impact ionization and three-body ion-electron recombination \\cite{PPR,Saquet2011,Saquet2012,Scaling} using detailed rate coefficients,  $k_{ij}$, $k_{i,ion}$ and $k_{i,tbr}$ validated by MD simulations \\cite{PVS}. \\begin{eqnarray}\n-\\frac{d\\rho_i}{dt}&=&\\sum_{j}{k_{ij}\\rho_e\\rho_i}-\\sum_{j}{k_{ji}\\rho_e\\rho_j} \\nonumber\\\\\n&& +k_{i,ion}\\rho_e\\rho_i-k_{i,tbr}\\rho^3_e \n  \\label{level_i}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\noindent and,\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{d\\rho_e}{dt}=\\sum_{i}{k_{i,ion}\\rho_e^2}-\\sum_{i}{k_{i,tbr}\\rho^3_e}\n  \\label{electron}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe relaxation of Rydberg molecules balances with collisional ionization to determine an evolving temperature of avalanche electrons to conserve total energy per unit volume. \\begin{equation}\nE_{tot}=\\frac{3}{2}k_BT_e(t)\\rho_e(t)-R\\sum_i{\\frac{\\rho_i(t)}{n_i^2}},\n  \\label{energy}\n\\end{equation}\nHere, for simplicity, we neglect the longer-time effects of Rydberg predissociation and electron-ion dissociative recombination \\cite{Saquet2012}. Such calculations show that the conversion from Rydberg gas to plasma occurs on a timescale determined largely by the local Penning electron density, or Penning fraction, $P_f = \\rho_e/\\rho_0$, which depends on the local density of Rydberg molecules and their initial principal quantum number."

In the system proposed here [\\fig{system}(a)], its presence is evident. Moreover, CAR exchange magnitude can be directly related to the relevant energy scales, such as the Kondo \ntemperature, which provides a fingerprint for quantitative experimental verification of our predictions.",
      "Such processes give rise to an exchange mechanism \\cite{Yao},\nthat we henceforth refer to as \\emph{the CAR exchange}, which can greatly modify\nthe low-temperature transport behavior of correlated hybrid nanostructures. The CAR exchange may be seen as RKKY-like interaction between\ntwo nearby impurities on SC surface \\cite{Yao}. The effect can be understood as a consequence\nof spin-dependent hybridization of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR)\nstates \\cite{Yu,Shiba,Rusinov} in SC contact,\ncaused both by the overlap of their wave functions\nand their coupling to Cooper-pair condensate. This process is the most effective when the YSR states \nare close to the middle of the SC gap, {\\it e.g.} in the YSR-screened phase \\cite{YSRscreening}. The mechanism presented here is essentially the same,\nyet in the considered regime can be understood\nperturbatively without referring to YSR states,\nas a consequence of the non-local pairing induced by SC electrode. In particular, the presence of YSR bound states close to the Fermi level \nis not necessary for significant consequences for the Kondo physics, \nas long as some inter-dot pairing is present. The proximity of SC induces pairing in QDs \\cite{RozhkovArovas,Buitelaar} \nand tends to suppress the Kondo effect if the superconducting energy gap $2\\Delta$ \nbecomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature $T_K$ \n\\cite{Buitelaar2002Dec,adatomsSC,Kondo_vs_SC1,Kondo_vs_SC2,Zitko_Kondo-Andreev,Zitko_S-QD-N,IW_Sau,YSRscreening}. Moreover, the strength of SC pairing can greatly affect the Kondo physics in the sub-gap transport regime: For QDs attached to SC and normal contacts, it can enhance the Kondo effect\n\\cite{DomanskiIW,KWIW,part1}, while\nfor DQD-based Cooper pair splitters, it tends to suppress both the $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Kondo effects \\cite{IW_Kacper}. Our main result is that the non-local pairing induced by superconducting \nproximity effect, which gives rise to CAR exchange, can be the sole cause of the Kondo screening. Moreover, relatively small values of coupling to SC, $\\GS{}\\ll U$, are sufficient for the effect to occur.",
      "The proximity of SC gives rise to two further exchange mechanisms that\ndetermine the system's behavior. First of all, the (conventional)\n\\emph{RKKY interaction} appears, $J \\sim \\GS{}^2$ \\cite{RK,K,Y}. Moreover, the \\emph{CAR exchange} emerges as a consequence of finite $\\GS{}$ \\cite{Yao}. It can be understood on the basis \nof perturbation theory as follows. DQD in the inter-dot singlet state may absorb\nand re-emit a Cooper pair approaching from SC; see \\fig{system}(e)-(g). As a second-order\nprocess, it reduces the energy of the singlet, which is the ground state of isolated DQD. A similar process is not possible in the triplet state due to spin conservation. Therefore, the singlet-triplet energy splitting $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is increased (or generated for $t=J=0$). More precisely, the leading ($2$nd-order in $t$ and $\\GS{}$) terms\nin the total exchange are \n\\begin{equation}\nJ^{\\mathrm{eff}} \t\\approx \tJ + \\frac{4t^2}{U-U'+\\frac{3}{4}J} + \\frac{4\\GS{}^2}{U+U'+\\frac{3}{4}J}. \\label{Jeff}\n\\end{equation}\nUsing this estimation, one can predict $T^*$ for finite $\\GS{}$, $t$ and $J$ with \\eq{Tstar}. Apparently, from three contributions corresponding to:\n(i) RKKY interaction, (ii) direct exchange and (iii) CAR exchange, only the first may bear a negative (ferromagnetic) sign. The two other contributions always have an anti-ferromagnetic nature. More accurate expression for $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is derived in Appendix~\\ref{sec:downfolding} [see \\eq{A_J}] by the Hamiltonian down-folding procedure. The relevant terms differ \nby factors important only for large $\\GS{}/U$. Finally, it seems worth stressing that normal leads are not necessary for CAR exchange to occur. At least one of them is inevitable for the Kondo screening though, and two symmetrically coupled \nnormal leads allow for measurement of the normal conductance. It is also noteworthy that inter-dot Coulomb interactions\ndecrease the energy of intermediate states contributing to direct exchange [\\fig{system}(c)], while increasing the energy of intermediate\nstates causing the CAR exchange [\\fig{system}(f)]."

South Dakota Supreme Court Holds Unconstitutional State Law Requiring Internet Retailers Without In-State Physical Presence to Remit Sales Tax. Judicial junk, the Court has long thought, is easier to scrap when the erroneous precedent cannot be fixed by Congress, as in constitutional cases.1\u00d7 1. See Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 405\u201310 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); Lee Epstein, William M. Landes & Adam Liptak, The Decision to Depart (or Not) from Constitutional Precedent: An Empirical Study of the Roberts Court, 90 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1115, 1116 (2015) (\u201c[Justice Brandeis\u2019s] dissenting opinion . . . now has the status of black letter law.\u201d). On the flip side, whenever a bad precedent can be corrected by Congress, stare decisis applies with \u201cspecial force. \u201d2\u00d7 2. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 172\u201373 (1989). The Court, following Justice Brandeis, usually articulates the rule as distinguishing between \u201cconstitutional\u201d and \u201cstatutory\u201d precedents. See, e.g., id. But the distinction is occasionally said to be between \u201cconstitutional\u201d and \u201cnonconstitutional cases.\u201d See, e.g., Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 543 (1962) (plurality opinion). Nomenclature aside, the Court has \u2014 until now \u2014 adhered to Justice Brandeis\u2019s key insight that the important factor is whether or not the mistake may be legislatively corrected. Last Term, in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.,3\u00d7 3. 138 S. Ct. 2080 (2018). the Court tinkered with this thinking in overruling an outdated dormant commerce clause precedent. Dormant commerce clause decisions technically produce constitutional holdings, but Congress may override them at will.4\u00d7 4. See Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U.S. 408, 421\u201327 (1946). Under the usual logic of stare decisis, it should take special force to dislodge such precedents. But Wayfair applied the weakened stare decisis of constitutional cases, asserting that the Court must \u201caddress a false constitutional premise . . . .",
      "Id. at 2102 (quoting Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 279, 318 (1992)). while Justice Scalia had \u201crecogniz[ed] that stare decisis has \u2018special force\u2019 in the dormant Commerce Clause context due to Congress\u2019s \u2018final say over regulation of interstate commerce.\u2019\u201d48\u00d7 48. Id. (quoting Quill, 504 U.S. at 320 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment)). Moreover, \u201c[i]f stare decisis applied with special force in Quill, it should be an even greater impediment\u201d afterward since Quill effectively \u201ctossed [the ball] into Congress\u2019s court. \u201d49\u00d7 49. Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Kimble, 135 S. Ct. at 2409); cf. Bay Mills, 134 S. Ct. at 2039 n.12 (\u201cWhen we inform Congress that it has primary responsibility over a sphere of law, and invite Congress to consider a specific issue within that sphere, we cannot deem irrelevant how Congress responds.\u201d). Because the Court invited Congress to act and then \u201csuddenly chang[ed] the ground rules, the Court may have waylaid Congress\u2019s consideration of the issue. \u201d50\u00d7 50. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2102\u201303 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). In Wayfair, the Court applied the flimsier form of stare decisis to a precedent that could have been overruled by Congress. It did so in the context of a dormant commerce clause case, but Wayfair\u2019s logic extends to all constitutional default rules \u2014 that is, constitutional decisions that Congress remains free to change. Not only does Wayfair deviate from the Court\u2019s decades-old stare decisis analysis, it also imperils other precedents that set constitutional default rules. The Court\u2019s reasoning in Wayfair departs from its prior stare decisis analysis. In 1932, Justice Brandeis posited that stare decisis must bend \u201cin cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible.\u201d51\u00d7 51. Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 406\u201307 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). The Court has long since adopted his argument,52\u00d7 52. See, e.g., Smith v.

      "Carassale et al. introduced a frequency domain approach for nonlinear bridge aerodynamics and aeroelasticity. Ho et al. computed an output frequency domain function of a nonlinear damped duffing system modelled by a Volterra series under a sinusoidal input. Kim et al. identified the higher order frequency response functions by using the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input technique and the harmonic probing method. This type of frequency domain method is much more efficient than the time domain method due to the fast Fourier transform algorithm. However, the frequency domain method not only is limited by frequency resolutions but also suffers from leakage problems due to the use of discrete Fourier transforms. In addition, the frequency domain method calculates only a steady-state response. A natural response generated by initial conditions and a cross response caused by interactions between a system and an excitation are ignored. In contrast, the Laplace domain method can calculate all response components because initial conditions are considered in the computational procedure. However, it has been restricted to analytical operations for simple excitations, such as sinusoidal excitations and exponential excitations . The proposed method falls into the category of the Volterra series method computed in the Laplace domain. Unlike the traditional Laplace domain method, the proposed method is applicable to arbitrary irregular excitations. Because the proposed method follows a similar path as a pole-residue method for linear systems , the proposed method to solve nonlinear system vibration problems is called the generalized pole-residue method. The main concept of the pole-residue method developed by Hu et al. was that the poles and residues of the response could be easily obtained from those of the input and system transfer function to obtain the closed-form response solution of linear systems. This method included three steps: (1) writing the system transfer function into pole-residue form; (2) writing the excitation into pole-residue form by the Prony-SS method; (3) computing the poles and residues of the response by an algebraic operation based on those from system and excitation.",
      "For a long response with small time steps, the time domain methods are very costly in computational time. Volterra series is another widely used method, which is the extension of the Duhamel integral for linear systems . Volterra series can reproduce many nonlinear phenomena, but they are very complex due to higher-dimensional convolution integrals . Since 1980's, significant progress has been made in the general area of the Volterra series. The reader is referred to Ref. for a quite thorough literature review on the relevant topics. After 2017, most papers focus on Volterra series identification. De Paula and Marques proposed a method for the identification of Volterra kernels, which was based on time-delay neural networks. Son and Kim presented a method for a direct estimation of the Volterra kernel coefficients. Dalla Libera et al. introduced two new kernels for Volterra series identification. Peng et al. used the measured response to identify the kernel function and performed the nonlinear structural damage detection. Only a few papers concentrated on simplifying the computation of convolution integrals. Traditional methods for computing convolution integrals involved in the Volterra series have been performed in three distinct domains: time, frequency and Laplace. The time domain method based on Volterra series refers to discrete time convolution methods, which also suffer computational cost problems . Both the frequency domain method and the Laplace domain method based on the Volterra series consist of three steps: (1) Volterra series are transformed into an algebraic equation in the frequency domain or Laplace domain; the algebraic equation is solved by purely algebraic manipulations; and (3) the solution in Step ( ) is transformed back to the time domain. Many researchers have used the frequency domain method to compute the responses of nonlinear systems. Billings et al. developed a new method for identifying the generalized frequency response function (GFRF) of nonlinear systems and then predicted the nonlinear response based on these GFRFs.",
      "Compared to the traditional pole-residue method for a linear system, one of the novelties of the pole-residue method in this paper is how to deal with the higher-order poles and their corresponding coefficients. Because the proposed method derives an explicit, continuous response function of time, it is much more efficient than traditional numerical methods. Unlike the traditional Laplace domain method, the proposed method is applicable to arbitrary irregular excitations. Because the natural response, forced response and cross response are naturally obtained in the solution procedure, meaningful mathematical and physical insights are gained. In numerical studies, systems with a known equation of motion and an unknown equation of motion are investigated. For each system, regular excitations and complex irregular excitations with different parameters are studied. Numerical studies validate the good accuracy and high efficiency of the proposed method by comparing it with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Introduction\n\nMost real dynamic systems, as encountered in mechanical and civil engineering, are inherently nonlinear and include geometric nonlinearities, nonlinear constitutive relations in material or nonlinear resistances, etc. . Nonlinear problems are attracting increasing attention from engineers and scientists. This work focuses on solving nonlinear system vibration problems, i.e., computing transient responses of nonlinear oscillators under arbitrary irregular excitations based on a combination of a pole-residue operation and Volterra series. Because Volterra series are single-valued, the scope of the present study is restricted to nonlinear behaviours without bifurcations . To analyse nonlinear vibration problems, researchers have performed extensive studies and developed various mathematical methods. Popular methods include step-by-step numerical integration methods in the time domain, such as the Runge-Kutta method. This kind of method not only requires a small time-step resolution for obtaining high-precision solutions but also is prone to numerical instability .",
      "When t becomes larger, both y s (t) and y c (t) diminish due to the presence of system damping, and the total response is entirely governed by y f (t). Moreover, we notice some features at t = 0 for these components, including y s (0) = \u2212y f (0) for the first-order response and y s (0) + y f (0) = \u2212y c (0) for the second-order response, which are due to imposed zero initial conditions. Conclusions\n\nConsidering arbitrary irregular excitations, an efficient generalized pole-residue method to compute the nonlinear dynamic response modelled by the Volterra series was developed. A core of the proposed method was obtaining poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions, then those of each order response modelled by each order Volterra series. Once the poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions and excitations were both available, the remaining derivation could follow a similar pole-residue method that had been developed for ordinary linear oscillators. To obtain the poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions, two steps were included: (1) using Laguerre polynomials to decouple higher-order Volterra kernel functions with respect to time and (2) obtaining poles and corresponding coefficients of Laguerre polynomials in the Laplace domain. Because the proposed method gave an explicit, continuous response function of time, it was much more efficient than traditional numerical methods. Moreover, many meaningful physical and mathematical insights were gained because not only each order response but also the natural response, the forced response and the cross response of each order were obtained in the solution procedure. To demonstrate that the proposed method was not only suitable for a system with a known equation of motion but also applicable to a system with an unknown equation of motion, two numerical studies were conducted. For each study, regular excitations and complex irregular excitations with different parameters were investigated."

While for two close adatoms on SC surface RKKY interactions may lead to prominent consequences\n\\cite{Klinovaja}, the conventional ({\\it i.e.} non-CAR) contribution should \nvanish rapidly when the inter-impurity distance $r$ exceeds a few lattice constants \\cite{RKKYrange,SC_RKKY}. Meanwhile, the CAR exchange may remain significant for $r$ of the order\nof coherence length of the SC contact \\cite{Yao}. Therefore, we first neglect the conventional RKKY coupling and analyze its consequences in Sec.~\\ref{sec:RKKY}. The main results are presented in \\fig{G-T}(a), showing the temperature dependence of $G$\nfor different circumstances.",
      "As $\\widetilde{T}_K$ grows for increasing $\\GS{1}$ (or $x$), $T^*$ decreases according to \\eq{Tstar}. Its $\\GS{}$ dependence can be accounted for by small changes in the coefficients $a$ and $b$ in \\eq{Tstar}, \nas long as $x$ is kept constant. To close the discussion of $T^*(x)$ dependence let us point out, that in \\eq{A_J} \nthere appears a correction to \\eq{Jeff} for $x\\neq 0$. However, it is very small due to additional\nfactor $\\GS{}^2/U^2$ in the leading order. Its influence on curves plotted in \\fig{x}(b) is hardly visible. In turn, let us examine the $x$ dependence of the $T=0$ conductance $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$. As can be seen \nin \\fig{x}(a), it monotonically increases with $x$, as it crosses $x=0$ point. In fact, \\eq{Gmin}\ncan be generalized to\n\\beq\nG_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{e^2}{h} \\cdot c \\, \\frac{\\GS{1}^2}{U^2} ,\n\\label{Gmin2}\n \\end{equation} \nwith $c\\approx 2.25$ (indicated by a dotted line in \\fig{x}(c)). Note that $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ is proportional to \n$\\GS{1}^2=(x+1)^2 \\GS{}^2$, instead of simply $\\GS{}$, cf. \\eq{Gmin}. The values of $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ obtained\nfrom all analyzed $G(T)$ dependencies for different $x$ have been compiled in \\fig{x}(c). It is evident, that \\eq{Gmin2} is approximately fulfilled for all the considered cases. Finally, it seems noteworthy that the normal-lead coupling asymmetry, \n$\\Gamma_{\\rm L}\\neq \\Gamma_{\\rm R}$, is irrelevant for the results except for a constant factor\ndiminishing the conductance $G$ \\cite{KWIWJB-asym}. \\section{The role of CAR efficiency}\n\\label{sec:coef}\n\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{Fig6.pdf}\n\\caption{Linear conductance between the normal leads\n\t\t $G$ as a function of coupling to SC lead, $\\GS{}$, for indicated values of RKKY exchange $J$\n\t\t and the efficiency of CAR processes reduced by factor (a) $\\mathcal{C}=0.9$ and (b) $\\mathcal{C}=0.5$.\n\t\t Other parameters as in \\fig{3}.

      "For reference, results for $\\GS{}=0$ are shown, exhibiting \nthe two-stage Kondo effect caused by \\emph{direct} exchange mechanism. As can be seen in \\figs{G-T}(b) and \\ref{fig:G-T}(c), an excellent agreement of $T^*$ found from NRG calculations and \\eq{Tstar} \nis obtained with $a=0.42$ and $b=1.51$, the same for both $U'=0$ and $U'=U/10$. Note, \nhowever, that $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is different in these cases, cf. \\eq{Jeff},\nand $U'$ leads to increase of $T^*$.\n\nFurthermore, for $t=0$ and $\\GS{}>0$ the two-stage Kondo effect caused solely by the \\emph{CAR\nexchange} is present; see \\fig{G-T}(a). Experimentally, this situation\ncorresponds to a distance between the two QDs smaller than the superconducting coherence length,\nbut large enough for the exponentially suppressed direct hopping to be negligible. While intuitively one could expect pairing to compete with any kind of magnetic ordering,\nthe Kondo screening induced by CAR exchange is a beautiful example of a superconductivity\nin fact leading to magnetic order, namely the formation of the Kondo singlet. This CAR-exchange-mediated Kondo screening is our main finding. For such screening, \\eq{Tstar} is still fulfilled with very similar \nparameters, $a=0.37$ ($a=0.35$) and $b=1.51$ ($b=1.50$) for $U'=0$ ($U'=U/10$),\ncorrespondingly; see \\figs{G-T}(b-c). Moreover, as follows from \\eq{Jeff}, $U'$ reduces CAR exchange, and therefore diminishes $T^*$.\nFor the same values of $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the dependence of $G(T)$ for $t=0$ and $\\GS{}>0$ is hardly different \nfrom the one for $\\GS{}=0$ and $t>0$ for $T\\geq T^*$ (results not shown). However, $G(T)$ saturates at residual value $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ as $T\\to 0$ only for finite\n$\\GS{}$, which at particle-hole symmetry makes $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$\nthe hallmark of SC proximity and the corresponding CAR exchange processes. From numerical results, one can estimate it as\n\\begin{equation}\nG_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{e^2}{h} \\cdot c \\ , \\frac{\\GS{}^2}{U^2} \n\t\\qquad {\\scriptstyle (\\GS{1}=\\GS{2}=\\GS{})} ,\n\\label{Gmin}\n\\end{equation}\nwith $c\\approx 2.25$, barely depending on $U'$ and getting smaller for $t>0$. \nThis is illustrated in \\figs{G-T}(d-e), where the dotted line corresponds to \\eq{Gmin} with $c=2.25$. \n\nLastly, in \\fig{G-T}(a) we also present the curves obtained for $t=\\GS{}$ chosen such, \nthat the quantity $\\xi=\\sqrt{t^2+\\GS{}^2}$ remains the same \nin all the cases.",
      "Consequently, the underscreened Kondo effect occurs \n\\cite{Mattis,NozieresBlandin} for weak $\\GS{}$ and, {\\it e.g.}, $J=-0.1U$; \nsee the point indicated by square in \\fig{3}.

      "Around this, Wirtz et al.  offered four mutually exclusive business models classifying Internet based business models to be precise. According to Wirtz et al. , these business models present in Web 2.0 are related to connection, content, context, and commerce. Building further, Yrj\u00f6l\u00e4 et al.  interpreted these business models as chronological layers, where \u201clower\u201d layer business models are pre-requisites for the \u201chigher\u201d layer business models to exist. Figure 1 The layered 4C ICT business models archetypes [Adapted from 35, 37, 38]. The first layer is concerned with connection-related business model where a stakeholder provides connection services . Connection- related business models are relevant to connectivity for all sorts of devices and nodes through various communication channels, e.g. PCs, smartphones, tablets, IoT devices, etc. The second layer is the business model focusing on monetizing content. At the content layer, all sorts of online content services (e.g. mobile video streaming) are classified (i.e. relevant, up-to-date and interesting) and are accessible conveniently for the end user. The content might be peer-to-peer/user-oriented contents (i.e. exchange of personal content), and web browsing content (audio, video, text etc.). The third, context, layer concerns the ability to create and monetize user, content, equipment/user device and system profiles and turn (big) data into meaningful information and knowledge through systemic virtual contextualization. The fourth layer concerns commerce, the ability to monetize any or all of the connection, content, or context specific resources, actors or activities related to the ongoing communications. At this layer, we identify business, consumer and public/government types of communications . Thus, B2B (business-to-business), B2C and B2G communications as well as C2B, C2C and C2G or G2B, G2C and G2G communications may be monetized at this layer. Casdesus-Masanell and Llanes\u2019s  offers different software business models based on the openness of core software and extension software offering.",
      "We will briefly open up the concept of MDM and IoT-MDM. The purpose of this study is to identify business potential for IoT-MDM service providers as cybersecurity vendor in the context of the future digital hospital. In doing so, we apply the concept of business model in order to make sense of a ICT-oriented business environment . Among various available conceptualizations, business model is considered as a boundary-spanning unit of analysis that explain the underlying business logic and the value creation and value capturing logic of an organization [11\u201315]. Traditionally, device management has been associated with management and configuration of handheld mobile devices , thus, mobile device management (MDM). Gartner  perceives MDM software to be a policy tool to configure and manage mobile handheld devices. They also mark that MDM services need to ensure security in reference to connectivity and content that is being transmitted. Along with surge of smart mobile devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) is growing large during the last few years and promises to flood the market with billions of devices in the coming years too . Zhang et al.  states scalability, transparency and reliability as important issues that differentiates IoT from the conventional Internet. To that end, there are several IoT platforms available currently in the market for managing, updating and configuring IoT nodes, e.g. IBM Bluemix, Cumulocity, ARM mbed OS, etc. . However, the transition raises the question about the differences and similarities between MDM and IoT device management as approaches. Takalo  marks MDM and IoT device management to be quite close on a conceptual level: both need solution for automated management of large device fleets consisting different form factors, device models, and operating system. Additionally, such systems conceptually needs to support various communication channels like: WiFi, cellular network and Ethernet. However, on practical level, MDM is more strictly controlled by operating systems and device vendors.",
      "Findings and analysis from the interviews and workshops are presented next. In this section, we present our analysis in four steps. First, we briefly discuss the relevance of Internet business models (4C)  to the context of the study, addressing how this approach can help cybersecurity providers identify business opportunities in IoT-MDM. Second, we present a 4-quadrant matrix reflecting four different 5G security-provisioning scenarios, which are also relevant to IoT-MDM. Then, we connect each scenario back to business models by applying a mixed-source business model approach  and identify different possible business models for each kind of cybersecurity provider. Finally, we connect the overall discussion back to the case of future digital hospital. The 4C business model archetypes helps decoding the boundaries between multiple business models operating either in the same verticals of the ecosystem or in the same horizontals. These archetypes can provide with a basis to classify and analyze business models of suppliers, competitors, and, at the same time, business models of customers. For this case, the 4C business model archetypes are mostly relevant for cybersecurity providers and IoT-MDM system/service providers as a tool to analyze customer business models and identify customer needs, the hospital management style. These customer needs can eventually be turned around as business opportunities. While IoT-MDM systems and services are not only concerned about cybersecurity, there is room for service providers to customize and tailor services based on customer needs. These service providers either can target customers from one layer (connection/content/context/commerce) across multiple industries, or, they can also target a specific industry (e.g. healthcare) create customized services for all the layers in that industry. To make sense of the overall cybersecurity provisioning for future 5G, we created the 4-quadrant matrix (Figure 3) by identifying major security drivers for new business creation in future 5G. These scenarios were created in workshops with telecommunication & cybersecurity experts from the industry.",
      "Though in this research, we adopt a high-level stance on cybersecurity from a technical perspective, the overall discussions on business potential are relevant to issues like information security, communication security, storage security, security at vulnerable touchpoints in hospital context (end user interface layer, IoT nodes, system layer, network layer). Futures digital hospitals will be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats because of its data-dependency and digital-intensive device network. Thus, the business opportunity for cybersecurity providers in this case can be considered as the need for automated and centralized IoT-MDM service. To that end, this paper presents four distinct players who can provide such service to a critical infrastructure like a digital hospital. The mixed-source business model options further open up multiple alternatives that each type of vendor can consider while tailoring services for the future digital hospital . This paper also connects the 4C ICT business model archetypes to cybersecurity business context which can be used as an analytical tool to identify customer needs and scope for value creation . Academically, this work contributes by filling up the void in discussing business models for cybersecurity as an industry. In addition, in the existing literature the hospital context has also been less discussed from a cybersecurity business perspective. From an industrial point of view, the business model options discussed in this research are timely and relevant to the market context and need. As mentioned, the mixed source business model options show how cybersecurity providers can extend their offering for different kinds of need for the hospital context based on their core businesses. This study can prove to be helpful for cybersecurity business entities and at the same time hospital managers. The scope of this paper explains business potential of cybersecurity vendors to an emerging industry from a higher level. In this paper, authors do not attempt to analyze the technical aspect of cyber security provisioning in healthcare context, however that is a forthcoming research possibility of this study."

      "Lastly, language specific models like Spanish BERT (la Rosa y Eduardo G. Ponferrada y Manu Romero y Paulo Villegas y Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez de Prado Salas y Mar\u00eda Grandury, 2022) and Portuguese BERT are available as well. Our winning solution makes use of these large language models trained on specific languages. Language Identification Models\n\nMany multilingual language identification models have been developed in order to classify the language of the input sentence beforehand. Even though the initial works used n-gram models and generative mixture models or even conditional random fields and other classical machine learning methods like naive bayes , modern methods have shifted to the use of deep learning for language identification . Recent works have mainly focused on deep learning based language identification, where handling codemixed data is a big challenge in the domain. For our experiments, we use a version of XLM-RoBERTa finetuned on a language identification dataset 2 . This model has near-perfect test accuracy of 99.6%. Dialect Classification\n\nDialect classification has been previously solved using statistical methods like Gaussian Mixture Models and Frame Selection Decoding or Support Vector Machines (SVM) . It has been explored relatively sparsely, mostly in the case for local languages . Deep learning approaches have been explored in previous editions of the VarDial workshop shared tasks and otherwise . Dialect classification was also explored previously as a part of other shared tasks . We want to stress that given the multilingual nature of the dataset, using the present methods directly was not an option. In our work, although we take inspiration from the previous works, we propose a novel system that surpasses the performance of the previous systems by a large margin. Data\n\nThe dataset  We observed that the class PT-BR had the most number of samples (2,724) and the class EN had the least number of samples (349), and thus the imbalance ratio was almost 1:8. We have illustrated the data distribution in Figure .",
      "We tried to mitigate this imbalance using over-sampling and weighted sampling methods. However, the improved data sampling method did not affect the performance. System Description\n\nThis was a problem of multi-class classification having 9 classes for Track-1 and 6 classes for Track-2. The samples were belonging to 3 languages having 3 varieties each, so the classification pipeline was made in 2 stages. The Language Identification (LID) model which is the first stage classifies the sentence into 3 languages: English (EN), Spanish (ES) and Portuguese (PT). The LID is a pretrained XLM-RoBERTa that is fine-tuned for the task of language identification. It is able to classify the input sentence into 20 languages. We classify and separate the samples according to their language. The samples corresponding to the specific languages are then fed into the language specific models for dialect identification. For dialect identification we have used models like BERT and RoBERTa with a linear layer connected to the pooler output of the models. Then fine-tuning is done on the models for dialect identification   using the samples corresponding to the specific languages. For the task of dialect identification we experimented with several pretrained models like XLM-RoBERTa, BERT, ELECTRA, GPT-2 and RoBERTa. All models were fine-tuned for 20 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-6 and weight decay 1e-6 with a batch size of 8. The best performing model checkpoint was chosen according to the epoch-wise validation macro-F1 score. 5 Experiments and Results\n\nExperiments using Large Language Models\n\nFor the task of Dialect Identification we have tried various language specific models like XLM-RoBERTa, BERT, ELECTRA, RoBERTa and GPT- 2. The base variant of all these models were used and all the models were used through the Hugging-Face library. The pooler output of these models was passed through a linear layer and the models were fine-tuned. First, we experimented with different models for Track-1.

      "This gave rise to multiple national dialects of the same language. The VarDial workshop (colocated with EACL 2023) explores various dialects and variations of the same language. We participated in the Discriminating Between Similar Languages -True Labels (DSL-TL) shared task. In this task, the participants were provided with data from three languages, with each language having three varieties.

Moreover, we beat the next best submission by a margin of 4.5% in the first task and 5.6% in the second task. We were the only team to surpass the organizer baseline scores. We present our winning solution in this paper. We used an end-to-end deep learning pipeline which consisted of a language identification model and three language-specific models, one for each language. We converged upon the best combination by doing an elaborate analysis of various models available. Furthermore, in this work we also analyze the performance of the pipeline as a whole and also provide an ablation study. Lastly, we provide some future directions in this area of research. Related Work\n\nThe present literature encompasses various aspects of dialect identification. We study this from three perspectives: large language models, language identification and dialect classification problems. Large Language Models\n\nThe success of transformers and BERT based models was inevitable since the initial boom of the transformer  2017) model. In recent years, many other architectures like RoBERTa and ELECTRA have further pushed the state-of-the-art in this domain. Moreover, autoregressive models like GPT and GPT-2 have also shown their prowess. Multilingual versions of RoBERTA, namely XLM-RoBERTa are also available.",
      "We used XLM-RoBERTa as the baseline for all 3 languages. The best performing models for the English language were RoBERTa and BERT whereas GPT-2 was the worst performing. Similarly the language specific versions of RoBERTa and BERT performed well for the Spanish and Portuguese respectively. Overall the worst performing model was GPT-2 across all 3 languages. The validation F1 scores are present in Table . The two best-performing models for every language were chosen for Track-2. The same procedure as specified above was used and the F1 scores are present in Table . The train and validation F1 scores for 2-class classification are higher for all models as compared to the F1 score of the same models for 3-class classification. This was mainly due to the poor representation and accuracy of classification of the third class. We observed symptoms of overfitting in all models after 12-15 epochs and the best validation F1 score was obtained in the range of 4-8 epochs. LID experiments\n\nThe pipeline for dialect identification is divided into two parts as the sentences in the dataset belong to different languages. The stages are described in Section 4. The XLM-RoBERTa we have used for language classification has a test accuracy of 99.6% meaning it correctly classifies all input sentences and hence, can be considered as a perfect classifier. For the final pipeline we experimented using the two best performing models for each language in Track-1 and Track-2. For both the tracks we experimented with all 8 (2 3 ) possible combinations of models and calculated the validation F1 score for the combined validation dataset which had sentences belonging to all languages. The validation scores for Track-1 and Track-2 are shown in Table and Table respectively. For both the tracks, the three pipelines with the best validation F1 scores were chosen for submission.

      ".\n, \u03c4 n ) for n > 1 are the higher-order Volterra kernel functions, which describe the nonlinear behaviour of the system. The complete formulation of y(t) includes infinite series where the labour of calculating the n th term increases quickly with the growth of n. Fortunately, the response accuracy may be ensured by the first several order Volterra series. This is proved here in numerical studies. The commonly known Laguerre polynomials are represented as : where p i is the order of the Laguerre polynomials and a i is the damping rate. The Laguerre polynomials satisfy the orthogonal relationship expressed as: By using Laguerre polynomials, the Volterra kernel function h n (t 1 , . . .\n, t n ) in Eq. 3 can be decoupled as follows : where the coefficient is computed resorting to the orthogonal relationship in Eq. 5: Substituting Eq. 6 into Eq. 3 yields . . . The above operation that uses the Laguerre polynomials to decouple Volterra higher order kernel functions has been well-developed. The reader is referred to Refs. for details about the adopted technique. After decoupling Volterra higher order kernel functions in time, one can regroup Eq. 8 into: . . . By denoting Eq. 9 becomes The above procedure to compute the nonlinear response by a combination of Volterra series and Laguerre polynomials is schematically shown in Fig. . Volterra kernel functions h n (t 1 , . . . , t n ) can be obtained by either an equation of motion or measured input-output signals. To derive a closedform solution of the response, we must obtain a closed-form solution of x i (t) first. In the following presentation, a closed-form solution of the aforementioned x i (t) and y n (t) is derived by using the pole-residue method. 3. Pole-residue method for calculating x i (t) and y n (t) Performing the Laplace transform of x i (t) in Eq. 10 yields where in which Eq. 13 includes a single pole and several higher-order poles. For k = 0, \u2212a i is a single pole, and b p i (0) is a corresponding coefficient, namely, the residue.",
      "When t becomes larger, both y s (t) and y c (t) diminish due to the presence of system damping, and the total response is entirely governed by y f (t). Moreover, we notice some features at t = 0 for these components, including y s (0) = \u2212y f (0) for the first-order response and y s (0) + y f (0) = \u2212y c (0) for the second-order response, which are due to imposed zero initial conditions. Conclusions\n\nConsidering arbitrary irregular excitations, an efficient generalized pole-residue method to compute the nonlinear dynamic response modelled by the Volterra series was developed. A core of the proposed method was obtaining poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions, then those of each order response modelled by each order Volterra series. Once the poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions and excitations were both available, the remaining derivation could follow a similar pole-residue method that had been developed for ordinary linear oscillators. To obtain the poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions, two steps were included: (1) using Laguerre polynomials to decouple higher-order Volterra kernel functions with respect to time and (2) obtaining poles and corresponding coefficients of Laguerre polynomials in the Laplace domain. Because the proposed method gave an explicit, continuous response function of time, it was much more efficient than traditional numerical methods. Moreover, many meaningful physical and mathematical insights were gained because not only each order response but also the natural response, the forced response and the cross response of each order were obtained in the solution procedure. To demonstrate that the proposed method was not only suitable for a system with a known equation of motion but also applicable to a system with an unknown equation of motion, two numerical studies were conducted. For each study, regular excitations and complex irregular excitations with different parameters were investigated.",
      "Compared to Hu et al. , which was regarded as an efficient tool to compute responses of linear systems, the generalized pole-residue method in this paper is introduced to compute responses of nonlinear systems. The proposed method involves two steps: (1) the Volterra kernels are decoupled in terms of Laguerre polynomials, and (2) the partial response related to a single Laguerre polynomial is obtained analytically in terms of the pole-residue method. Compared to the traditional pole-residue method for a linear system, one of the novelties of the generalized pole-residue method is how to deal with the higher-order poles and their corresponding coefficients. Similar to the Taylor series, the Volterra series representation is an infinite series, and convergence conditions are needed to assure that the representation is meaningful. Because the proposed method is based on the Volterra series, only the system with convergent Volterra series representation can be treated by the proposed method. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the nonlinear response is modelled by a Volterra series, and Volterra kernel functions are decoupled by Laguerre polynomials. Then, the pole-residue method for computing explicit responses is developed in Section 3. Numerical studies and discussions are given in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 5. Response calculation based on Volterra series\n\nA nonlinear oscillator, whose governing equation of motion is given by where z(t, y, \u1e8f) represents an arbitrary nonlinear term; m, c, and k are the mass, damping and linear stiffness, respectively; y(t), \u1e8f(t) and \u00ff(t) are the displacement, velocity and acceleration, respectively; and f (t) is the time-dependent excitation. If the energy of excitation f (t) is limited, the nonlinear response under zero initial conditions (i.e., zero displacement and zero velocity) can be represented by the Volterra series : where N is the order of Volterra series and In Eq. 3, h 1 (\u03c4 ) is called the first-order Volterra kernel function, which represents the linear behaviour of the system; h n (\u03c4 1 , . .",
      "In this study, the input excitation is white noise with a constant power spectrum S 0 = 0.001, and the corresponding response is obtained by solving Eq. 28 by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, which is shown in Fig. . From Section 4.1, we determine that the sum of the first two orders of responses agrees well with the total response. In this study, the order of Volterra series N is chosen to be 2, damping rates of Laguerre polynomials are a 1 = a 2 = 2, and numbers of Laguerre polynomials are R 1 = R 2 = 24. To estimate the first two orders of Volterra kernel functions, a matrix equation is constructed using excitation data and response data. By using the least square method to solve this matrix equation, coefficients c p 1 and c p 1 p 2 in Eq. 8 are identified. Figure plots c p 1 and c p 1 p 2 , respectively, which have good agreement with the exact results in Fig. . Then, the first two order Volterra kernel functions are constructed by Eq. 6. Compared with the exact results in Figs. , the identified Volterra kernel functions in Fig. completely agree well with the exact solutions. Note that the white noise excitation, which can excite more frequency components of the response, is chosen to obtain good Volterra kernel functions. A regular excitation f (t) = sin(\u03c0t) and an irregular excitation f (t) = N f n=1 A n cos(\u2126 n t + \u03b8 n ) with A n = 0.3 and \u2126 n varying from 0 to 40 with equal interval 1 are chosen as input excitations. The predicted responses, along with results obtained by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, are shown in Fig. . In both cases, the proposed method accurately predicts system responses. As presented in Eq. 23, a nonlinear response is the sum of three terms: natural response y s (t), forced response y f (t) and cross response y c (t). These individual terms, as well as their sum to two excitations, are shown in Figs. 27 and 28, respectively. As shown in Figs. and 28, both first-and second-order responses include the natural response y s (t) and the forced response y f (t), but the cross response y c (t) only exists in second-order responses."

      "m i \u223c N ( \u0125; \u00b5, \u03c3) 9: end for 10: return m\n\nMessage Generation Architecture\n\nNow, we can define the pipeline for message generation. The idea is to create an architecture that can generate features to enable independent message tokens. We expand each compressed token into the space of the hidden state h (1-layer linear expansion) since each token has a natural embedding in R |h| . Then, we perform attention using a softmin to help minimize similarity with previous tokens and sample the new token from a variational distribution. See algorithm 1 for complete details. During execution, we can generate messages directly due to equation 1, resolving any computation time lost from sequential compositional message generation. Utility through Contrastive Learning\n\nFirst, note that our Markov Network is as follows: H j \u2192 M j \u2192 Y i \u2190 H i . Continue to denote i as the agent identification and j as the agent ID such that j = i. We aim to satisfy the utility objective of the information bottleneck, I(M j ; Y i ), through contrastive learning as shown in figure 1. Proposition 5.1. Utility mutual information is lower bounded by the contrastive NCE-binary objective, The proof is in Appendix A.1. This result shows a need for gradient information to flow backward across agents along communication edge connections. Experiments and Results\n\nWe condition on inputs, especially rich information (such as pixel data), and task-specific information. When evaluating an artificial language in MARL, we are interested in referential tasks, in which communication is required to complete the task. With regard to intent-grounded communication, we study ordinal tasks, which require coordination information between agents to complete successfully. Thus, we consider tasks with a team of agents to foster messaging that communicates coordination information that also includes their observations. To test H1, structuring emergent messages enables lower complexity, we test our methodology and analyze the input-oriented information and utility capabilities.",
      "In table 1, the size of the messages is automatically compressed to the smallest size to represent the information. Despite a trivially small amount of mutual information between tokens, our compositional method is able to reduce the message size in bits by 2.3x using our derived regularization, for a total of an 8x reduction in message size over non-compositional methods such as ae-comm. Since the base unit for the token is a 32-bit float, we note that each token in the message may be further compressed. We observe that each token uses three significant digits, which may further compress tokens to 10 bits each for a total message length of 20 bits. Communication Utility Results\n\nDue to coordination in MARL, grounding communication in referential features is not enough. Finding the communication utility requires grounding messages in ordinal information. Overall, figure shows that our compositional, contrastive method outperforms all methods focused on solely input-oriented communication grounding. In the blind traffic junction, our method yields a higher average task success rate and is able to achieve it with a lower sample complexity. Training with the contrastive update tends to spike to high success but not converge, often many episodes before convergence, which leaves area for training improvement. That is, the contrastive update begins to find aligned latent spaces early in training, but it cannot adapt the methodology quickly enough to converge. The exploratory randomness of most of the early online data prevents exploitation of the high utility f + examples. This leaves further room for improvement for an adaptive contrastive loss term. Regularization loss convergence After convergence to high task performance, the autoencoder loss increases in order to represent the coordination information. This follows directly from the information bottleneck, where there exists a tradeoff between utility and complexity. However, communication, especially referential communication, should have an overlap between utility and complexity.",
      "Information-maximizing autoencoders aim to maximize the state reconstruction accuracy for each agent. How-ever, grounding communication in observations has been found to easily satisfy these input-based objectives while still requiring a myriad more samples to explore to find a task-specific communication space . Thus, it is necessary to use task-specific information to communicate informatively. This will enable learned compression for task completion rather than pure compression for input recovery. Other work aims to use the information bottleneck to decrease the entropy of messages . In our work, we use contrastive learning to increase representation similarity with future goals, which we show optimally optimizes the Q-function for messages. Natural Language Inspiration\n\nThe properties of the tokens in emergent communication directly affect their informative ability. As a baseline, continuous communication tokens can represent maximum information but lack human-interpretable properties. Discrete 1-hot (binary vector) tokens allow for a finite vocabulary, but each token contains the same magnitude of information, with equal orthogonal distance to each other token. Similar to word embeddings in natural language, discrete prototypes are an effort to cluster similar information together from continuous vectors . Building on the continuous word embedding properties, VQ-VIB , an information-theoretic observation grounding based on VQ-VAE properties , uses variational properties to provide word embedding properties for continuous emergent tokens. Like discrete prototypes, they exhibit a clustering property based on similar information but are more informative. However, each of these message types determines a single token for communication. Tokens are stringed together to create emergent \"sentences\". Preliminaries\n\nWe formulate our setup as a decentralized, partially observable Markov Decision Process with communication (Dec-POMDP-Comm). Formally, our problem is defined by the tuple, S, A, M, T , R, O, \u2126, \u03b3 .",
      "A set of these tokens makes a message m.\nTo satisfy the complexity objective, we want to use m i to well-represent h i and consist of independently informative m i l . Independent Information\n\nWe derive an upper bound for the interaction information between all tokens. Proposition 4.1. For the interaction information between all tokens, the following upper bound holds: The proof is in Appendix A.1. Since we want the mutual information to be minimized in our objective, we minimize,\n\nInput-Oriented Information\n\nIn order to induce complexity in the compositional messages, we additionally want to minimize the mutual information I(H; M ) between the composed message m and the encoded information h. We derive an upper bound on the mutual information that we use as a Lagrangian term to minimize. Proposition 4.2. For the mutual information between the composed message and encoded information, the following upper bound holds:\nThe proof is in Appendix A.1. Thus, we have our Lagrangian term, Conditioning on the input or observation data is a decentralized training objective. Sequence Length\n\nCompositional communication necessitates an adaptive limit on the total length of the sequence. Corollary 4.3. Repeat tokens, w, are redundant and can be removed. Suppose one predicts two arbitrary tokens, w k and w l . Given equation 1, it follows that there is low or near-zero mutual information between w k and w l . A trivial issue is that the message generator will predict every available token as to follow the unique token objective. Since the tokens are imbued with input-oriented information (equation 2), the predicted tokens will be based on relevant referential details. Thus, it follows that tokens containing irrelevant information will not be chosen. A nice optimization objective that follows from corollary 4.3 is that one can use self-supervised learning with an end-ofsequence (EOS) token to limit the variable total length of compositional message sequences.

    "documentation": [
      "More specifically, \\emph{AutoCogniSys} extends our existing work \\cite{alam16} in three dimensions,\n\n\\emph{(1) True Automation:} We first investigate the correlations of cognitive impairment with human activities and stress where we manually labeled activities, extract the corresponding physiological sensor (EDA and PPG) features of each activity, and use statistical method to find correlations. Then, we propose automatic complex activity recognition based on a Hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Network (HDBN) model, fine-grained extraction of physiological sensor features and finally machine learning classification of cognitive impairment.\n\n\\emph{(2) Noises Elimination:} We define different types of noises on ACC, EDA and PPG sensors, propose extensive signal processing techniques to remove noises and show significant improvement can be achieved in cognitive impairment classification.\n\n\\emph{(3) Implementation and Evaluation:} Finally, we design and implement IoT system and analytic methods and minimize the human involvement to automate our proposed cognitive health assessment approach by considering effective smart home sensor customization and deployment, data collection, screening, cleaning and filtering, feature computation, normalization and classification, and activity  model training. \\textbf{Research Questions:} \\emph{AutoCogniSys} consequently tackles the following key research questions. $\\bullet$ Can we detect simultaneously the periodic rhythms of  both hand gestures and postural activities from wrist-worn ACC sensor signal for diverse population (population with same activity but diverse ways such as walking with walker, stretcher or normally)? If so, how can we incorporate the hand gesture, posture and ambient sensor data streams to help improve the ADLs recognition models?\n\n$\\bullet$ How can we exploit and relate the micro-activity features into noise free physiological sensor signals processing to automate cognitive health assessment process? What are the critical roles of clinical survey and technology guided assessment methodologies and their inter-relationships for automating the different intermediate steps of cognitive health assessment process?",
      "At first, we obtain instant hand gestural and postural activities from our above proposed models, and additionally motion sensor and object sensor readings from our IoT-system for every time instant generating a 4-hierarchy of HDBN model. Considering the context set $\\langle gestural, postural, ambient,object\\rangle$ as a hierarchical activity structure (extending two 2-hierarchical HDBN \\cite{alam16b}), we build complex activity recognition model for single inhabitant scenario. Finally, we infer the most-likely sequence of complex activities (and their time boundaries), utilizing the well-known Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm \\cite{dempster77} for training and the Viterbi algorithm \\cite{forney73} for run-time inference. \\section{Automatic Activity Features Estimation}\nThe effects of cognitive ability on daily activity performance have been studied before \\cite{dawadi14,akl15}. They experimentally and clinically validated that cognitive impairment highly reduces the daily activity performances and this activity performance can be computed as an indicator of cognitive ability status of older adults. The standard activity features refer to completeness of task (TC), sequential task ability (SEQ), interruption avoidance capabilities (INT) etc. In current behavioral science literature, the above activity features carry specific definition based on the sub-tasks involved with a complex activity \\cite{dawadi14,akl15}. Completeness of task refers to how many sub-tasks are missed by the participants. Sequential task ability refers to how many sequences of sub-tasks are missed referring the gerontologist defined standard sequences of the sub-task for the particular complex activity. Interruption avoidance capability refers to how many times the participants stop or interleave while doing any sub-task. The final goal of activity features estimation is to provide overall task score. The task score is proportional to the functional ability of participants in performance daily activities.",
      "This sketching can help us significantly to identify which particular hand gesture is being performed in the time segment. \\subsubsection{EES Datasets: EDA and PPG Sensor Datasets} We used Eight-Emotion Sentics (EES) dataset to validate \\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposed physiological signal processing approaches \\cite{picard01}. The dataset consists of measurements of four physiological signals (PPG/Blood Volume Pulse, electromyogram, respiration and Skin Conductance/EDA) and eight affective states (neutral, anger, hate, grief, love, romantic love, joy, and reverence). The study was taken once a day in a session lasting around 25 minutes for 20 days of recordings from an individual participant. We consider only PPG and EDA for all of the affective states in our study. \\subsubsection{Baseline Methods}\nThough no frameworks ever combined all modalities together into real-time automated cognitive health assessment, we evaluate \\emph{AutoCogniSys} performance by comparing the performances of its components individually with upto date relevant works. For hand gesture and postural activity recognition, we consider \\cite{alam17} proposed method as baseline. For complex activity recognition, we compare our hand gesture and postural activity classifiers aided HDBN model with three-level Dynamic Bayesian Network \\cite{zhu12} framework. For activity performance estimation, activity performance based cognitive health assessment; and EDA and PPG based cognitive health assessment, we have considered \\cite{alam16} proposed method as baseline. \\subsection{Activity Recognition Evaluation}\nThe standard definition for \\emph{accuracy} in any classification problem is $\\frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$ where $TP,TN,FP$ and $FN$ are defined as true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative. For complex activity recognition evaluation, we additionally consider \\emph{start/end duration error} as performance metric that can be explained as follows: consider that the true duration of ``cooking'' is 30 minutes (10:05 AM - 10:35 AM) and our algorithm predicts 29 minutes (10.10 - to 10.39 AM).",
      "Ambient sensors also help capture the movement patterns of objects and humans for activity and behavior recognition \\cite{dawadi14,dawadi15}. Researchers also proved the existence of correlations between cognitive impairment and everyday task performance \\cite{dawadi14, akl15,alam16} as well as physiological symptoms \\cite{alam16,sano15}. Although current studies showed some successes in IoT-assisted cognitive health assessment in different domains individually, there are several existing challenges in developing and validating a fully automated multi-modal assessment model. \\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\emph{Real-time IoT System}: A real-time IoT system must include a continuous and fault tolerant data streaming capability among central hub, wearable sensors and ambient sensors regardless of network communication protocol (WiFi, Ethernet, Bluetooth etc.) which are not available in existing researches. \\item \\emph{Multi-modal Context Fusion}: Though several offline clinically validated cognitive health assessment tools exist \\cite{wai03, starling99, krapp07, yesavage82, zung71}, there is no universally accepted method for IoT-assisted automatic cognitive health assessment in smart home environment that can fuse multi-modal sensor contexts altogether. For example, some researchers showed ambient sensors based Activities of Daily Livigin (ADLs) sequence pattern can signify the cognitive health status of older adults \\cite{akl15, dawadi15}. Researchers also showed wearable Electrodermal Activity pattern analysis may carry the significance of cognitive status \\cite{sano15}. However, for validation of IoT based cognitive health assessment, self-reported surveys, clinical diagnosis and observation based tools are used individually by prior researchers \\cite{akl15, dawadi15, sano15, alam16}. \\end{enumerate}\n\nRegarding aforementioned challenges for the automation of cognitive health assessment, \\emph{AutoCogniSys} considers (i) reproducibility of our model in any smart home system consists of ambient motion sensors, wearable accelerometer (ACC) sensors, wearable Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors individually or combined streams; (ii) context awareness based on ambient motion sensors and wearable ACC sensors in any types of activities such as hand gestural, postural and complex ADLs; and (iii) high accuracy, i.e., a recall rate of over 90\\% with less than 5\\% false positive rate."

      "We define S as the set of states, A i , i \u2208 [1, N ] as the set of actions, which includes task-specific actions, and M i as the set of communications for N agents. T is the transition between states due to the multi-agent joint action space T : S \u00d7 A 1 , ..., A N \u2192 S. \u2126 defines the set of observations in our partially observable setting. Partial observability requires communication to complete the tasks successfully. O i : M 1 , ..., M N \u00d7 \u015c \u2192 \u2126 maps the communications and local state, \u015c, to a distribution of observations for each agent. R defines the reward function and \u03b3 defines the discount factor. Architecture\n\nThe policy network is defined by three stages: Observation Encoding, Communication, and Action Decoding. The best observation encoding and action decoding architecture is task-dependent, i.e., using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), CNNs , GRUs , or transformer layers are best suited to different inputs. The encoder transforms observation and any sequence or memory information into an encoding H. The on-policy reinforcement learning training uses RE-INFORCE or a decentralized version of MAPPO as specified by our experiments. Our work focuses on the communication stage, which can be divided into three substages: message encoding, message passing (often considered sparse communication), and message decoding. We use the message passing from . For message decoding, we build on a multiheaded attention framework, which allows an agent to learn which messages are most important . Our compositional communication framework defines the message encoding, as described in section 4. Objective\n\nMutual information, denoted as I(X; Y ), looks to measure the relationship between random variables, which is often measured through Kullback-Leibler divergence , I(X; Y ) = D KL (p(x, y)||p(x) \u2297 p(y)). The message encoding substage can be defined as an information bottleneck problem, which defines a tradeoff between the complexity of information (compression, I(X, X)) and the preserved relevant information (utility, I( X, Y )).",
      "m i \u223c N ( \u0125; \u00b5, \u03c3) 9: end for 10: return m\n\nMessage Generation Architecture\n\nNow, we can define the pipeline for message generation. The idea is to create an architecture that can generate features to enable independent message tokens. We expand each compressed token into the space of the hidden state h (1-layer linear expansion) since each token has a natural embedding in R |h| . Then, we perform attention using a softmin to help minimize similarity with previous tokens and sample the new token from a variational distribution. See algorithm 1 for complete details. During execution, we can generate messages directly due to equation 1, resolving any computation time lost from sequential compositional message generation. Utility through Contrastive Learning\n\nFirst, note that our Markov Network is as follows: H j \u2192 M j \u2192 Y i \u2190 H i . Continue to denote i as the agent identification and j as the agent ID such that j = i. We aim to satisfy the utility objective of the information bottleneck, I(M j ; Y i ), through contrastive learning as shown in figure 1. Proposition 5.1. Utility mutual information is lower bounded by the contrastive NCE-binary objective, The proof is in Appendix A.1. This result shows a need for gradient information to flow backward across agents along communication edge connections. Experiments and Results\n\nWe condition on inputs, especially rich information (such as pixel data), and task-specific information. When evaluating an artificial language in MARL, we are interested in referential tasks, in which communication is required to complete the task. With regard to intent-grounded communication, we study ordinal tasks, which require coordination information between agents to complete successfully. Thus, we consider tasks with a team of agents to foster messaging that communicates coordination information that also includes their observations. To test H1, structuring emergent messages enables lower complexity, we test our methodology and analyze the input-oriented information and utility capabilities.",
      "Next, we analyze the ability of heterogeneous agents to understand differing communication policies (H2)). Finally, we consider the effect of social shadowing (H3), in which agents solely learn a communication policy from an expert agent's action policy. We additionally analyze the role of offline reinforcement learning for emergent communication in combination with online reinforcement learning to further learn emergent communication alongside an action policy. We evaluate each scenario over 10 seeds. Environments\n\nBlind Traffic Junction We consider a benchmark that requires both referential and ordinal capabilities within a team of agents. The blind traffic junction environment requires multiple agents to navigate a junction without any observation of other agents. Rather, they only observe their own state location. Ten agents must coordinate to traverse through the lanes without colliding into agents within their lane or in the junction. Our training uses REINFORCE . Pascal VOC Game We further evaluate the complexity of compositional communication with a Pascal VOC . This is a two-agent referential game similar to the Cifar game but requires the prediction of multiple classes. During each episode, each agent observes a random image from the Pascal VOC dataset containing exactly two unique labels. Each agent must encode information given only the raw pixels from the original image such that the other agent can recognize the two class labels in the original image. An agent receives a reward of 0.25 per correctly chosen class label and will receive a total reward of 1 if both agents guess all labels correctly. See figure 2. Our training uses heterogeneous agents trained with PPO (modified from MAPPO repository). For simplicity of setup, we consider images with exactly two unique labels from a closed subset of size five labels of the original set of labels from the Pascal VOC data. Furthermore, these images must be of size 375 \u00d7 500 pixels. Thus, the resultant dataset comprised 534 unique images from the Pascal VOC dataset.",
      "Baselines\n\nTo evaluate our methodology, we compare our method to the following baselines: (1) no-comm, where agents do not communicate; (2) rl-comm, which uses a baseline communication method learned solely through policy loss ; (3) ae-comm, which uses an autoencoder to ground communication in input observations ; (4) VQ-VIB, which uses a variational autoencoder to ground discrete communication in input observations and a mutual information objective to ensure low entropy communication . We provide an ablation of the loss parameter \u03b2 in table 1 in the blind traffic junction scenario. When \u03b2 = 0, we use our compositional message paradigm without our derived loss terms. We find that higher complexity and independence losses increase sample complexity. When \u03b2 = 1, the model was unable to converge. However, when there is no regularization loss, the model performs worse (with no guarantees about referential representation). We attribute this to the fact that our independence criteria learns a stronger causal relationship. There are fewer spurious features that may cause an agent to take an incorrect action. In order to understand the effect of the independent concept representation, we analyze the emergent language's capacity for redundancy. A message token m l is redundant if there exists another token m k that represents the same information. With our methodology, the emergent 'language' converges to the exact number of observations and intents required to solve the task. With a soft discrete threshold, the independent information loss naturally converges to a discrete number of tokens in the vocabulary. Our \u03b2 ablation in table 1 yields a bijection between each token in the vocabulary and the possible emergent concepts, i.e., the enumerated observations and intents. Thus for \u03b2 = 0.1, there is no redundancy. Sparse Communication In corollary 4.3, we assume that there is no mutual information between tokens. In practice, the loss may only be near-zero. Our empirical results yield independence loss around 1e \u2212 4."

Some try to make sense of it and that must have been some office party that the editorial board of the Washington Post is still coming down from judging by \"A good year in Iraq.\" First up, meet the new Iraqi Body Count -- an organization that provides cover for the war and allows supporters of the illegal war to point to it and insist/slur \"Things aren't so bad!\" Sure enough, the editorial board of the Post does just that noting the laughable \"civilian deaths\" count at iCasualities. As we noted -- long, long before we walked away from that crap ass website, they're not doing a civilian count.",
      "BNO notes that protest and also that a group of Iraqi MPs are alleging that Iraqiya bought seats in the Cabinet via money exchanged in Jordan. UPI adds, \"Maliki, a Shiite who has a long history of working with Tehran, has named himself acting minister of defense, interior and national security, three most powerful and sensitive posts in the government he is stitching together. Although Maliki appears to be bending over backward to accommodate rivals among Iraq's Shiite majority as well as minority Sunnis and Kurds in his administration in a spirit of reconciliation, he is unlikely to relinquish those ministries that dominate the security sector.\" DPA reports, \"Sheikh Abdel-Mahdi al-Karbalaei, a confident of influential Shiite spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, said that the new cabinet is 'below the standards' Iraqi citizens had hoped for and suggested it could prove to be weaker than the previous government.\" Ranj Alaaldin (Guardian) also spots clouds on the horizon:Lasting peace and stability depends on resolving outstanding disputes with the Kurds on oil, revenue-sharing, security and the disputed territories (Kirkuk in particular). The Kurds, rather than exploiting their kingmaker position to take a stronger proportion of ministries in Baghdad (they are taking just one major portfolio \u2013 the foreign ministry), are instead banking on guarantees from Maliki to implement their list of 19 demands that includes resolving the above disputes in their favour. They may have been naive, though. With their historical and federalist partners, the Islamic supreme council of Iraq in decline, the Kurds may be isolated in the new government \u2013 a government dominated by the nationalistic and centrist characteristics of the INM, the Sadrists and indeed State of Law. Maliki may, therefore, turn out to be unable to grant concessions even if he wanted to and could use Osama Nujayfi, the new ultra-nationalist speaker of parliament and Kurdish foe, to absorb the Kurdish criticism and insulate himself from any attacks.",
      "In reality, constant American pressure was applied to Maliki, Allawi, Kurdish leaders and other prominent Iraqi politicians throughout the entire nine-month process to form a cabinet. The US intervention included numerous personal phone calls and visits to Baghdad by both President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. The key objective of the Obama administration has been to ensure that the next Iraqi government will \"request\" a long-term military partnership with the US when the current Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) expires at the end of 2011. The SOFA is the legal basis upon which some 50,000 American troops remain in Iraq, operating from large strategic air bases such as Balad and Tallil and Al Asad. US imperialism spent billions of dollars establishing these advanced bases as part of its wider strategic plans and has no intention of abandoning them. Cogan's only the second person to include the SOFA in his report. Some are impressed with the 'feat' of taking nearly ten months to form a government, stringing the country along for ten months while no decisions could go through. The editorial board of the Washington Post, for example, was full of praise yesterday. Today they're joined by Iran's Ambassador to Iraq, Hassan Danaiifar. The Tehran Times reports that Danaiifar was full of praise today hailing the \"positive and final step which ended the 10-month political limbo in Iraq.\" However, Danaiifar was less pie-in-the-sky than the Post editorial board because he can foresee future problems as evidenced by his statement, \"We may witness the emergence of some problems after one and half of a year -- for example, some ministers may be impeached.\" Of course, there are already many clouds on the horizon, even if Iranian diplomats and Post editorial boards can't suss them out. For example, Ben Bendig (Epoch Times) noted the objection of Iraq's female politicians to Nouri al-Maliki's decision to nominate only one woman (so far) to his Cabinet: \"Some 50 female lawmakers went to the country's top leadership, the United Nations and the Arab League to voice their concern and desire for increased representation.\""

After all, a realistic approach that is alert to each branch\u2019s institutional capacities might have led to the conclusion that Congress was actually ill-equipped to overrule Quill.

      "\\section{Introduction\\label{sct::intro}}\nSymmetric, public-key (asymmetric) and hash-based cryptography constitute a fundamental pillar of modern cryptography. Symmetric cryptography includes symmetric-key encryption, where a shared secret key is used for both encryption and decryption. Cryptographic hash functions map arbitrarily long strings to strings of a fixed finite length. Currently deployed public-key schemes are\nused to establish a common secret key between two remote parties. They are based on factoring large numbers or solving the discrete logarithm problem over a finite group. For more details about modern cryptography the interested reader can consult one of the many excellent references on the topic, e.g.~\\cite{Katz:2007:IMC:1206501}. In contrast to asymmetric schemes based on factoring or solving the discrete logarithm problem and which are completely broken by a quantum adversary via Shor's algorithm~\\cite{SJC.26.1484}, symmetric schemes and hash functions are less vulnerable to quantum attacks. The best known quantum attacks against them are based on Grover's quantum search algorithm~\\cite{PhysRevLett.79.325}, which offers a quadratic speedup compared to classical brute force searching. Given a search space of size $N$, Grover's algorithm finds, with high probability, an element $x$ for which a certain property such as $f(x)=1$ holds, for some function $f$ we know how to evaluate (assuming such a solution exists). The algorithm evaluates $f$ a total of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ times. It applies a simple operation in between the evaluations of $f$, so the $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ evaluations of $f$ account for most of the complexity. In contrast, any classical algorithm that evaluates $f$ in a similar ``black-box'' way requires on the order of $N$ evaluations of $f$ to find such an element. Any quantum algorithm can be mapped to a quantum circuit, which can be implemented on a quantum computer. The quantum circuit represents what we call the ``logical layer\". Such a circuit can always be decomposed in a sequence of ``elementary \ngates\", such as Clifford gates (CNOT, Hadamard etc.~\\cite{NC00}) augmented by a non-Clifford gate such as the T gate.",
      "For example, very recently, there have been several cryptanalysis results~\\cite{1712.06239} and~\\cite{1802.03856} that attempt to reduce breaking some symmetric algorithms to solving a system of non-linear equations. Solving these non-linear equations is then attacked using a modified version of the quantum linear equation solver algorithm~\\cite{PhysRevLett.103.150502}. The results are heavily dependent on the condition number of the non-linear system, which turns to be hard to compute (it is not known for most ciphers and hash functions such as AES or SHA). Provided the condition number is relatively small, then one may get an  advantage compared to brute-force Grover search. However at this time it is not clear whether this is indeed the case, and we do not have large-scale quantum computers to experiment with. The quantum security parameter (based on our assumptions of using state-of-the-art algorithms and fault-tolerance methods) for symmetric and hash-based cryptographic schemes is summarized in Table~\\ref{tbl1}. For more details about space/time tradeoffs achievable via parallelization of Grover's algorithm please see the corresponding Sec.~\\ref{sct::ciphers}, Sec.~\\ref{sct::hash} and Sec.~\\ref{sct::bitcoin}, respectively. \\begin{table}[h!]\n\\begin{tabular}{ll}\n\\hline\nName    & qs  \\\\\n\\hline\nAES-128 & 106 \\\\\nAES-192 & 139 \\\\\nAES-256 & 172 \\\\\n\\hline\nSHA-256 & 166 \\\\\nSHA3-256\t &167 \\\\\nBitcoin's PoW & 75\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Quantum security parameter ($qs$) for the AES family of ciphers, SHA family of hash functions, and Bitcoin, assuming a conservative physical error rate per gate $p_g=10^{-4}$.}\n\\label{tbl1}\n\\end{table}\n\nWe also analyzed the security of asymmetric (public-key) cryptography, in particular RSA and ECC, in the light of new improvements in fault-tolerant \nquantum error correction based on surface code lattice surgery techniques.

      "The curves above the purple line show the overhead introduced by fault tolerance (in terms of required surface code cycles, each surface code cycle assumed to have unit cost). More optimization at the logical layer will shift the purple line down, whereas more optimization at the fault-tolerant layer will move the upper curves closer to the purple line. Similar remarks to the above hold for the remaining plots in this manuscript.}\n      \t\\label{fgr:aes_128_cycles} For example, the plots in Fig.~\\ref{fgr:aes_128_cycles} tells us that if we have $2^{50}$ quantum computers running Grover's algorithm in parallel, with no physical errors, then it would take about $2^{63}$ gate calls (where the purple line intersects the vertical line at $50$), where we assume each gate to have unit cost. Still with no errors, a trivial cost for implementing the cryptographic function (oracle) would bring the cost down to about $2^{38}$ oracle calls per quantum computer. Keeping the actual function implementation, but adding the fault-tolerant layer with a physical error rate of $10^{-7}$ (with appropriate assumptions and using state-of-the-art quantum error correction) pushes the cost up to around $2^{76}$ surface code cycles per quantum computer (where now each code cycle is assumed to have unit cost). Similar remarks hold for the remaining plots in this manuscript. \\includegraphics[width=0.429\\textwidth]{figures/AES-128_time.pdf}\n      \t\\captionof{figure}{AES-128 block cipher.

      "But in fact, this new formulation paves the way for an even simpler form of the metric. Consider a specific event, which happens at given radius value $r$. In a small region around that event, we will introduce a new coordinate $\\bar{r}$ to parametrize the radial direction. We want this coordinate to be co-moving with our infalling observers at $r$; each such observer then has a position $\\bar{r}=const.$ that does not change over time. Key to our next step is that we {\\em know} the metric for the local length and time measurements made by any one of our free-falling observers. By Einstein's equivalence principle, the metric is that of special relativity. Locally, namely whenever tidal effects can be neglected, spacetime geometry for any non-rotating observer in free fall is indistinguishable from Minkowski spacetime as described by a local inertial system. Since we have chosen both the time coordinate $T$ and the physical meaning of the radial coordinate $r$ so as to conform with the measurements of the local infalling observer, the transformation between $\\bar{r}$ and $r$ is particularly simple: It has the form of a Galilei transformation\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d}\\bar{r}= \\mathrm{d} r + \\beta(r)c\\:\\mathrm{d} T.\n\\label{barRshift}\n\\end{equation} In that way, as it should be by definition, radial coordinate differences at constant $T$ are the same in both systems, while for an observer at constant $\\bar{r},$ with $\\mathrm{d} \\bar{r}=0$, the relation between $\\mathrm{d} r$ and $\\mathrm{d} T$ is consistent with the definition of the function $\\beta(r)$ in (\\ref{betaDefinition}). Are you surprised that this is not a Lorentz transformation, as one might expect from special relativity? Don't be. We are not transforming from one local inertial coordinate system to another. The $T$ is already the time coordinate of the infalling observers, so both coordinate systems have the same definition of simultaneity, and time dilation plays no role in this particular transformation. Also, we have chosen $r$ intervals to correspond to length measurements of the infalling observers, so there is no Lorentz contraction, either.",
      "As we know from the Newtonian limit, such a mass attracts test particles in its vicinity. It should be noted, though, that all our calculations would also be compatible with the limit of no mass being present. In that case, ``infalling'' would be a misnomer, as our family of observers would merely hover in empty space at unchanging positions in $r$. \n\nWe can imagine infinitesimal local coordinate systems associated with our observers --- think of the observer mapping out space and time by defining three orthogonal axes, and by measuring time with a co-moving clock. We assume all such little coordinate systems to be non-rotating --- otherwise, we would break spherical symmetry, since rotation would locally pick out a plane of rotation that is distinguishable from the other planes. The radial direction is a natural choice for the first space axis of those little free-falling systems. The other directions, we take to point to observers falling side by side with our coordinate-defining observer --- and to remain pointed at a specific such other observer, once the choice of direction is made. We assume our infalling observers' clocks to be synchronised at some fixed radius value $r$. By spherical symmetry, those clocks should then be synchronised at {\\em all} values of $r$. Anything else would indicate direction-dependent differences for the infalling observers and their clocks, after all. Hence, at any given static time ${t}$, all the infalling observers who are at radius value $r$ show the same proper time $T$ on the ideal clocks travelling along with them. Once our definition is complete, our static, spherically symmetric spacetime is filled with infalling observers from that family: Whenever we consider an event $\\cal E$, there will be an observer from that family passing by at that time, at that location. Now, consider the coordinate speed of those infalling observers. If we position ourselves at some constant radius value $r$ and watch the falling observers fly by, then we can express both their proper time rate and their coordinate speed in the $r$ direction in terms of $r$ and ${t}$. We can combine the two pieces of information to obtain the rate of change in radial position $r$ with proper time $T$ for those infalling observers.",
      "\\section{$\\beta(r)$ from tidal deformations}\n\\label{TidalSection}\n\nIn the previous section, we had exploited symmetries and Einstein's equivalence principle. In order to determine $\\beta(r)$, we need to bring in additional information, namely the Einstein equations, which link the matter content with the geometry of spacetime. For our solution, we only aim to describe the spacetime metric outside whatever spherically-symmetric matter distribution resides in (or around) the center of our spherical symmetry. That amounts to applying the {\\em vacuum Einstein equations}. More specifically, we use a particularly simple and intuitive form of the vacuum Einstein equations, which can be found in a seminal article by Baez and Bunn:\\cite{BaezBunn2005} Consider a locally flat free-fall system around a specific event $\\cal E$, with a time coordinate $\\tau$, local proper time, where the event we are studying corresponds to $\\tau=0$. In that system, describe a small sphere of freely floating test particles, which we shall call a {\\em test ball}. The particles need to be at rest relative to each other at $\\tau=0$. Let the volume of the test ball be $V(\\tau)$. Then the vacuum version of Einstein's equations states that\n\\begin{equation}\n\\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 V}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2}\\right|_{\\tau=0} = 0.\n\\label{EinsteinVacuum}\n\\end{equation}\nIn words: If there is no matter or energy inside, the volume of such a test ball remains constant in the first order (those were our initial conditions) and the second order (by eq.~[\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}]). If you are familiar with Wheeler's brief summary of Einstein's equations, ``spacetime grips mass, telling it how to move'' and ``mass grips spacetime, telling it how to curve'',\\cite{Wheeler1990} you will immediately recognise that this is a specific way for the structure of spacetime telling the test ball particles how to move. The calculation later in this section provides the second part: It will amount to using (\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) to determine the structure of spacetime, namely the still missing function $\\beta(r)$, and that is the way for mass, in this case: for the absence of mass, to tell spacetime how to curve.",
      "But since the initial conditions for those observers are the same, and since our spacetime is, by assumption, static, the resulting function can only depend on $r$, and not explicitly on ${t}$. Let us rescale that function with the speed of light to make it dimensionless, give it an overall minus sign to make it positive for infalling particles, and call it $\\beta(r)$,\n\\begin{equation}\n\\beta(r)\\equiv -\\frac{1}{c}\\frac{\\mathrm{d} r}{\\mathrm{d} T}(r). \\label{betaDefinition}\n\\end{equation}\n\nRecall from section \\ref{SymmetriesCoordinates} that we also still have the freedom to decide on the physical meaning of $r$. We make the choice of making $\\mathrm{d} r$ the physical length measured by one of our infalling observers at the relevant location in spacetime, at constant time $T$. Via our angular coordinates, that implies that length measurements orthogonal to the radial direction, $r\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\vartheta$ and $r\\cdot\\sin\\vartheta\\:\\mathrm{d}\\varphi$ inherit the same physical interpretation. As a next step, we transform our metric (\\ref{StaticForm}) from the static form into the form appropriate for our coordinate choice $r$ and $T$. We do so by writing the static time coordinate as a function ${t}(T,r)$ in terms of infalling observer time and radius value. In consequence,\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d} {t} = \\frac{\\partial{t}}{\\partial T}\\cdot\\mathrm{d} T+ \\frac{\\partial {t}}{\\partial r}\\cdot\\mathrm{d} r,\n\\end{equation}\nand our new metric now has the form\n\\begin{align}\n \\mathrm{d} s^2 = {} & -c^2 F(r)\\left(\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial T}\\right)^2\\mathrm{d} T^2 \\nonumber \\\\[0.2em]\n & -2c^2F(r)\\left(\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial T}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial r}\\right)\\mathrm{d} T\\:\\mathrm{d} r \\nonumber \\\\[0.2em]\n & +\\left[G(r)-c^2F(r)\\left(\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial r}\\right)^2\\right]\\mathrm{d} r^2+r^2\\:\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2. \\end{align}\nAt face value, this looks like we are moving the wrong way, away from simplification, since we now have more functions, and they depend on two variables instead of one."

      "D) The functional hierarchy in both macaques and mice is primarily determined by the size of receptive fields in cortical regions, with macaques exhibiting a larger increase in receptive field size across visual pathways."

      "In fact, some studies using multiple pathways simulate the functions of mouse visual cortex to some extent . Our results further suggest that not only the mouse visual cortex might be an organization of parallel structures, but also there are extensive parallel information processing streams between each pair of cortical regions . For the two macaque datasets with different stimuli, not only are the model rankings significantly different, but also the correlations between the similarity scores and the model depth are totally opposite. These results corroborate the following two processing mechanisms in macaques: the ventral visual stream of primate visual cortex possesses canonical coding principles at different stages; the brain exhibits a high degree of functional specialization, such as the visual recognition of faces and other objects, which is reflected in the different neural responses of the corresponding region (although the face patch AM is a sub-network of IT, they differ in the neural representations). Besides, as shown in Figure , The calculation and plotting of the trajectories are the same as Figure . the similarity scores of vision transformers reach the maximum in the early layers and then decrease. Differently, the scores of CNNs and SNNs keep trending upwards, reaching the maximum in almost the last layer. On the other hand, Appendix C shows that vision transformers perform well in Macaque-Face dataset but poorly in Macaque-Synthetic dataset. Considering the features extraction mechanism of vision transformers, it divides the image into several patches and encodes each patch as well as their internal relation by self-attention. This mechanism is effective for face images that are full of useful information. However, the synthetic image consists of a central target object and a naturalistic background. When vision transformers are fed with this type of stimuli, premature integration of global information can lead to model representations containing noise from the unrelated background.",
      "Depths of the layers with the highest similarity scores exhibit little differences across mouse cortical regions, but vary significantly across macaque regions, suggesting that the visual processing structure of mice is more regionally homogeneous than that of macaques. Besides, the multi-branch structures observed in some top mouse brain-like neural networks provide computational evidence of parallel processing streams in mice, and the different performance in fitting macaque neural representations under different stimuli exhibits the functional specialization of information processing in macaques. Taken together, our study demonstrates that SNNs could serve as promising candidates to better model and explain the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the visual system. Originally, the prototype of deep neural networks is inspired by the biological vision system . To date, deep neural networks not only occupy an unassailable position in the field of computer vision , but also become better models of the biological visual cortex compared to traditional models in the neuroscience community (Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte 2014; . They have been successful at predicting the neural responses in primate visual cortex, matching the hierarchy of ventral visual stream (G\u00fcc \u00b8l\u00fc and van Gerven 2015; , and even controlling neural activity . Moreover, as training paradigms of mice and techniques for collecting neural activity (de Vries et al. 2020) have been greatly improved, there is a strong interest in exploring mouse visual cortex. Deep neural networks also play an important role in revealing the functional mechanisms and structures of mouse visual cortex . Compared to biological networks, Artificial Neural Networks discard the complexity of neurons . Spiking Neural Networks, incorporating the concept of time and spikes, are more biologically plausible models . To be more specific, because of their capabilities of encoding information with spikes, capturing the dynamics of biological neurons, and extracting spatio-temporal features, deep SNNs are highly possible to yield brain-like representations ).",
      "Nevertheless, the best layer of macaque IT appears in the last part of networks, where the feature map has been downsampled more times. In summary, our results might reveal two distinctions in the functional hierarchy between macaques and mice. First, there is a distinct functional hierarchical structure of macaque ventral visual pathway, while there might be no clear sequential functional hierarchy in mouse visual cortex. One explanation is that the mouse visual cortex is organized into a parallel structure and the function of mouse cortical regions are more generalized and homogeneous than those of macaques. Another possibility would be that even though the sequential relations exist among mouse cortical regions as proposed in anatomical and physiological work, they are too weak for the current deep neural networks to capture. Additionally, mice perform more complex visual tasks than expected with a limited brain capacity . Consequently, the neural responses of mouse visual cortex may contain more information not related to object recognition that neural networks focus on. Secondly, it is well known that the units in the neural networks get larger receptive fields after downsampling, and through the analyses of differences between two groups of models based on depth, we find the feature map of the best layer for mouse is downsampled fewer times than that for macaque. Based on these results, we provide computational evidence that the increased ratio of the receptive field size in cortical regions across the mouse visual pathway is smaller than those across the macaque visual pathways, which echoes some physio- Macaque-Face dataset --- Table : The correlation between the similarity scores and the number of parameters. r is Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. \"-\" indicates that there is no significant correlation. To explore the processing mechanisms in the visual cortex of macaques and mice, we investigate the model properties from the whole to the details. As shown in Table and 2, we first measure the correlation between the similarity scores and the sizes (i.e. the number of trainable parameters and the depth) of network models.",
      "What's more, when we take all models with the top 20% representation similarities as a whole for analyses, as described in the above paragraph, the properties that enable networks to achieve higher neural similarity are not yet clear. Taken together, the computational mechanism of the better models may reveal core processing divergence to different types of stimuli in the visual cortex. In this work, we take large-scale neural representation similarity experiments as a basis, aided by analyses of the similarities across models and the visual cortical regions. Compared to other work, we introduce SNNs in the similarity analyses with biological neural responses for the first time, showing that SNNs achieve higher similarity scores than CNNs that have the same depth and almost the same architectures. As analyzed in Section 3.1, two properties of SNNs might serve as the explanations for their high similarity scores. The subsequent analyses of the models' simulation performance and structures indicate significant differences in functional hierarchies between macaque and mouse visual cortex. As for macaques, we observed a clear sequential hi-erarchy. However, as for mouse visual cortex, some work ) exhibits that the trend of the model feature complexity roughly matches the processing hierarchy, but other work suggests that the cortex ) is organized into a parallel structure. Our results are more supportive of the latter. Furthermore, we provide computational evidence not only that the increased ratio of the receptive field size in cortical regions across the mouse visual pathway is smaller than those across the macaque visual pathway, but also that there may be multiple pathways with parallel processing streams between mouse cortical regions. Our results also clearly reveal that the processing mechanisms of macaque visual cortex differ to various stimuli. These findings provide us with new insights into the visual processing mechanisms of macaque and mouse, which are the two species that dominate the research of biological vision systems and differ considerably from each other."

In Miami, Vinny Colangelo created 1,500 internet website names to entice drug users throughout the nation to one of his six South Florida pain clinics or pharmacies. Even the Mafia got in on the Florida oxy express action: A Bonanno crime family associate oversaw a local crew stocking up on Palm Beach and Broward pain clinic oxycodone, upstreaming profits to the New York family. At times, it seemed almost no section of the country was free of Florida-supplied pills: When Olubenga Badamosi was arrested driving his Bentley Continental in Miami in 2011, the Oregon man was one of two traffickers overseeing a crew smuggling South Florida oxycodone to sell in Salt Lake City, Seattle and Denver as well as Oregon, Nevada, Texas and even Alaska. Pharmacy delivers oxy \u2018pot of gold\u2019\nIt would be hard to overstate Florida\u2019s role in feeding the country\u2019s voracious appetite for oxycodone. Oxycodone 30-milligram tablets were favored by addicts. And in 2009 and 2010, roughly four of every 10 of those pills were sold in Florida. Small wonder: Of the nation\u2019s top 100 oxycodone-buying doctors, 90 were in Florida. Pharmacies, too, ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies."

      "In Ref. \\cite{Aurell12} Aurell and Ekeberg performed a comparison between PLM and some of the just mentioned mean-field-based algorithms on the pairwise interacting Ising-spin  ($\\sigma = \\pm 1$) model, showing how PLM performs sensitively better, especially on sparse graphs and in the high-coupling limit, i.e., for low temperature. In this work, we aim at performing statistical inference  on a model whose interacting variables are continuous $XY$ spins, i.e., $\\sigma \\equiv \\left(\\cos \\phi,\\sin \\phi\\right)$ with $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi ) $. The developed tools can, actually, be also straightforward applied  to the $p$-clock model  \\cite{Potts52} where the phase $\\phi$ takes discretely equispaced $p$ values  in the $2 \\pi$ interval, $\\phi_a =  a 2 \\pi/p$, with $a= 0,1,\\dots,p-1$. The $p$-clock model, else called vector Potts model, gives a hierarchy of discretization of the $XY$ model as $p$ increases. For $p=2$, one recovers the Ising model, for $p=4$ the Ashkin-Teller model \\cite{Ashkin43}, for $p=6$ the ice-type model \\cite{Pauling35,Baxter82} and the eight-vertex model \\cite{Sutherland70,Fan70,Baxter71} for $p=8$.  \nIt turns out to be very useful also for numerical implementations of the continuous $XY$ model. Recent analysis on the multi-body $XY$ model has shown that for a limited number of discrete phase values ($p\\sim 16, 32$) the thermodynamic critical properties of the $p\\to\\infty$ $XY$ limit are promptly recovered \\cite{Marruzzo15, Marruzzo16}. Our main motivation to study statistical inference is that these kind of models have recently turned out to be rather useful in describing the behavior of optical systems, \nincluding standard mode-locking lasers \\cite{Gordon02,Gat04,Angelani07,Marruzzo15} and random lasers \\cite{Angelani06a,Leuzzi09a,Antenucci15a,Antenucci15b,Marruzzo16}.

      "The temperature behaviour of ${\\rm err_J}$ agrees with the one already observed for Ising spins in \\cite{Nguyen12b} and for XY spins  in \\cite{Tyagi15} with a mean-field approach:  ${\\rm err_J}$ displays a minimum around $T\\simeq 1$ and then it increases for very lower $T$; however,\n the error obtained with the PLM with decimation is several times smaller  than the error estimated by the other methods.\n\n\n\n \n \n\n     \n     \\section{Conclusions}\n     \\label{sec:conc}\n\n\nDifferent statistical inference methods have been applied to the inverse problem of the XY model. After a short review of techniques based on pseudo-likelihood and their formal generalization to the model we have tested their performances against data generated by means of Monte Carlo numerical simulations of known instances\nwith diluted, sparse, interactions. The main outcome is that the best performances are obtained by means of the  pseudo-likelihood method combined with decimation. Putting to zero (i.e., decimating) very weak bonds, this technique turns out to be very precise for  problems whose real underlying interaction network is sparse, i.e., the number of couplings per variable does not scale with number of variables. The PLM + decimation method is compared to the PLM + regularization method, with $\\ell_2$ regularization and to a mean-field-based method. The behavior of the quality of the network reconstruction is analyzed by looking at the overall sorted couplings and at the single site couplings, comparing them with the real network, and at the true positive curves in all three approaches. In the PLM +decimation method, moreover, the identification of the number of decimated bonds at which the tilted pseudo-likelihood is maximum allows for a precise estimate of the total number of bonds. Concerning this technique, it is also shown that the network with the most likely number of bonds is also the one of least reconstruction error, where not only the prediction of the presence of a bond is estimated but also its value.",
      "\\ref{sec:model} we introduce the general model  and we discuss its  derivation also  as a model for light transmission through random scattering media. In Sec. \\ref{sec:plm} we introduce the PLM with $l_2$ regularization  and with decimation, two variants of the PLM respectively introduced in Ref. \\cite{Wainwright06} and \\cite{Aurell12} for the inverse Ising problem. Here, we analyze these techniques for continuous $XY$ spins and we test them on thermalized data generated by Exchange Monte Carlo numerical simulations of the original model dynamics. In Sec. \\ref{sec:res_reg} we  present the results related to the PLM-$l_2$. In Sec. \\ref{sec:res_dec} the results related to the PLM with decimation are reported and its performances are compared to the PLM-$l_2$ and to a variational mean-field method analyzed in Ref. \\cite{Tyagi15}. In Sec. \\ref{sec:conc}, we outline conclusive remarks and perspectives. \\section{The leading $XY$ model}\n      \\label{sec:model}\n The leading model we are considering is defined, for a system of $N$ angular $XY$ variables, by the Hamiltonian \n \\begin{equation}\n  \\mathcal{H} = - \\sum_{ik}^{1,N} J_{ik} \\cos{\\left(\\phi_i-\\phi_k\\right)} \n  \\label{eq:HXY}\n \n  \\end{equation} \n  \n  The $XY$ model is well known in statistical mechanics, displaying important physical\n  insights, starting from the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\n  transition in two dimensions\\cite{Berezinskii70,Berezinskii71,Kosterlitz72} and moving to, e.g., the\n  transition of liquid helium to its superfluid state \\cite{Brezin82}, the roughening transition of the interface of a crystal in equilibrium with its vapor \\cite{Cardy96}. In presence of disorder and frustration \\cite{Villain77,Fradkin78} the model has been adopted to describe synchronization problems as the Kuramoto model \\cite{Kuramoto75} and in the theoretical modeling of Josephson junction arrays \\cite{Teitel83a,Teitel83b} and arrays of coupled lasers \\cite{Nixon13}. Besides several derivations and implementations of the model in quantum and classical physics, equilibrium or out of equilibrium, ordered or fully frustrated systems, Eq. (\\ref{eq:HXY}), in its generic form,\n  has found applications also in other fields.",
      "Each spin has then connectivity $4$, i.e., we expect to infer an adjacency matrix with $N c = 256$ couplings different from zero. The dynamics of the simulated model is based on the Metropolis algorithm and parallel tempering\\cite{earl05} is used to speed up the thermalization of the system. The thermalization is tested looking at the average energy over logarithmic time windows and\nthe acquisition of independent configurations\nstarts only after the system is well thermalized. For the values of the couplings we considered two cases: an ordered case, indicated in the figure as  $J$ ordered (e.g., left column of Fig. \\ref{PL-Jor1}) where the couplings can take values $J_{ij}=0,J$, with $J=1$, \n   and a quenched disordered case, indicated in the figures as  $J$ disordered (e.g., right column of Fig. \\ref{PL-Jor1})\n   where the couplings can take also  negative values, i.e., \n    $J_{ij}=0,J,-J$, with a certain probability. The results here presented were obtained with bimodal distributed $J$s: \n   \n    $P(J_{ij}=J)=P(J_{ij}=-J)=1/2$.  The performances of the PLM have shown not to depend on $P(J)$. \n   \n    We recall that in Sec. \\ref{sec:plm} we used the temperature-rescaled notation, i.e., $J_{ij}$ stands for $J_{ij}/T$. \n   \n    To analyze the performances of the PLM, in Fig. \\ref{PL-Jor1} the inferred couplings, $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm inf}$, are shown on top of the original couplings,  $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm true}$.\n     The first figure (from top) in the left column shows  the $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm inf}$ (black) and the $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm tru}$ (green) for a given spin\n     at temperature $T/J=0.7$ and number of samples  $M=1024$. PLM appears to reconstruct the correct couplings, though zero couplings are always given a small inferred non-zero value. In the left column of Fig.  \\ref{PL-Jor1},  both the $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm{inf}}$ and the $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm{tru}}$ are sorted in decreasing order and plotted on top of each other. We can clearly see that $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm inf}$ reproduces the expected step function."

      "We recorded 11,678 individual sharks, with an average total catch of 963 individuals per month (SD \u00b1 434) and 19.7 individuals per trip (SD \u00b1 15.6). Standardised CPUE (per 100 hooks per set) ranged from 0.05 to 22.13 individuals, with an average of 0.96 and a mode of 0.20. Catch consisted of 42 different species from 18 families (Table 4). 22% of all landings were classified as threatened species (i.e. VU, EN, CR) according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and 73% were near threatened. Almost half (46.3%) of landings were regulated (i.e. CITES-listed) species. The most commonly caught species were silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), black tip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) and scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini). Table 4. Sharks species landed in Tanjung Luar from January 2014 \u2013December 2015 (VU = Vulnerable, EN = Endangered, NT = Near Threatened, LC = Least Concern, NE = Not Evaluated (VU and EN classified as \u2018threatened\u2019 in this study); II = CITES Appendix II, N = Not CITES-listed (II species classified as \u2018regulated\u2019 in this study)). Measures of CPUE for the Tanjung Luar shark fishery vary spatially and temporally, and with several aspects of fishing effort including gear type, hook number, engine power and number of sets. An initial comparison of average catch per trip and catch per set of the two major gear types, surface longline and bottom longline, indicates that CPUE of surface longlines was significantly higher than that of bottom longlines (ANOVA, p<0.001). CPUE (individuals per set) was also positively associated with number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets (Fig 2). However, these relationships are for unstandardised CPUE i.e. without controlling for number of hooks. Plots of CPUE: Number of individuals per set (A) and number of individuals per 100 hooks per set (standardised CPUE) (B) by gear type (1), number of hooks (2), number of sets (3) and engine horsepower (4). When controlling for hook number using standardised CPUE (individuals per 100 hooks per set) the relationships were reversed, with standardised CPUE of bottom longlines significantly higher than that of surface longlines (ANOVA, p<0.001; Fig 2).",
      "More detailed socioeconomic data were collected in a full household survey in 2016, as outlined in Lestari et al. . Shark landings data were collected by three experienced enumerators, who were trained in species identification and data collection methods during a two-day workshop and three weeks of field mentoring to ensure the accuracy of the data collected. Landings were recorded every morning at the Tanjung Luar shark auction facility where shark fishers usually landed dead sharks, from 5am to 10am from January 2014 to December 2015. The enumerators recorded data on catch composition and fishing behaviour (Table 1) from 52 different vessels across a total of 595 fishing trips. The enumerators also measured the weight of selected sharks to calculate biomass and length-weight relationship. Table 1. Types of data collected on fishing behaviour and catch composition during daily landings data collection at Tanjung Luar. From fishing behaviour and catch data we calculated the overall species composition of catch. We calculated catch per unit effort (CPUE) by number of individuals using both catch per set (hereafter CPUE per set) and catch per 100 hooks per set (hereafter standardised CPUE) [25,26]. This was deemed necessary since different vessels and gear-types systematically deploy different numbers of hooks, and standardised CPUE allows for a more meaningful comparison. To understand factors influencing overall CPUE we log transformed CPUE per trip to fit a normal distribution, and fitted linear models (LMs) of CPUE per trip to fishing behaviour variables (Table 1). We considered all variables and used minimum AIC values with stepwise analysis of variance to identify the best fit and most significant influencing variables. To inform the development of practical fisheries management measures (e.g. gear restrictions), we also specifically analysed differences in CPUE for surface and bottom longline gears employed in the fishery, using two-way ANOVAs. Factors affecting catch of threatened and regulated species.",
      "Unstandardised CPUE was also significantly higher for surface longlines than bottom longlines. However, when standardising CPUE for the number of hooks (i.e. individuals per 100 hooks per set) this relationship was reversed. Bottom longlines exhibit a higher standardised CPUE, with negative relationships between catch per 100 hooks per set and number of hooks and frequency of sets. Vessels with moderate engine horsepower (50-59hp) also had the highest standardised CPUE. Since surface longlines systematically employ significantly more hooks than bottom longlines (400\u2013600 vs 25\u2013200 hooks), and tend to be associated with larger boats, longer trips and more sets, these findings suggest that although increasing fishing effort increased total catch for these gears and trips, there were diminishing returns of this increased effort above low to moderate levels. A large proportion of Tanjung Luar\u2019s shark catch consisted of threatened (22%) and regulated species (46%). Month is a significant factor in explaining standardised CPUE of both threatened and regulated species, which could indicate seasonal variation in the abundance of these species in the Tanjung Luar fishing grounds, or seasonal impacts on CPUE due to poor weather conditions. Fishing ground was a significant factor in explaining the catch of threatened species but not the catch in regulated species. This may be due to differences in range, distribution and relative abundance of species within these groups. Threatened species make up a relatively small proportion of Tanjung Luar\u2019s catch in comparison to regulated species, which make up almost half of the catch (46%). As such, regulated species may generally be more abundant and spatially diffuse than threatened species, and therefore caught more uniformly across fishing grounds. For example, regulated species catch is dominated by silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis), which are circum-tropical and coastal-pelagic, and exhibit limited site-fidelity or aggregation behaviour, while threatened species catch is dominated by scalloped hammerheads (Sphyrna lewini), which are known to aggregate in schools.",
      "Overfishing is a major threat to the survival of shark species, primarily driven by international trade in high-value fins, as well as meat, liver oil, skin and cartilage. The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) aims to ensure that commercial trade does not threaten wild species, and several shark species have recently been listed on CITES as part of international efforts to ensure that trade does not threaten their survival. However, as international trade regulations alone will be insufficient to reduce overexploitation of sharks, they must be accompanied by practical fisheries management measures to reduce fishing mortality. To examine which management measures might be practical in the context of a targeted shark fishery, we collected data from 52 vessels across 595 fishing trips from January 2014 to December 2015 at Tanjung Luar fishing port in East Lombok, Indonesia. We recorded 11,920 landed individuals across 42 species, a high proportion of which were threatened and regulated species. Catch per unit effort depended primarily on the number of hooks and type of fishing gear used, and to a lesser degree on month, boat engine power, number of sets and fishing ground. The most significant factors influencing the likelihood of catching threatened and regulated species were month, fishing ground, engine power and hook number. We observed significant negative relationships between standardised catch per unit effort and several indicators of fishing effort, suggesting diminishing returns above relatively low levels of fishing effort. Our results suggest that management measures focusing on fishing effort controls, gear restrictions and modifications and spatiotemporal closures could have significant benefits for the conservation of shark species, and may help to improve the overall sustainability of the Tanjung Luar shark fishery. These management measures may also be applicable to shark fisheries in other parts of Indonesia and beyond, as sharks increasingly become the focus of global conservation efforts."

Unfortunately, it is intractable to model \u03c0 R + (y|m) and \u03c0 R \u2212 (y) directly during iterative learning, but we can sample y + \u223c \u03c0 R + (y|m) and y \u2212 \u223c \u03c0 R \u2212 (y) directly from our network during training. It has been shown that log p(y|m) provides a bound on mutual information , with the expectation over l p(m l , y l ). However, we need a tractable understanding of the information Y . In the information bottleneck, Y represents the desired outcome. In our setup, y is coordination information that helps create the desired output, such as any action a \u2212 .",
      "m i \u223c N ( \u0125; \u00b5, \u03c3) 9: end for 10: return m\n\nMessage Generation Architecture\n\nNow, we can define the pipeline for message generation. The idea is to create an architecture that can generate features to enable independent message tokens. We expand each compressed token into the space of the hidden state h (1-layer linear expansion) since each token has a natural embedding in R |h| . Then, we perform attention using a softmin to help minimize similarity with previous tokens and sample the new token from a variational distribution. See algorithm 1 for complete details. During execution, we can generate messages directly due to equation 1, resolving any computation time lost from sequential compositional message generation. Utility through Contrastive Learning\n\nFirst, note that our Markov Network is as follows: H j \u2192 M j \u2192 Y i \u2190 H i . Continue to denote i as the agent identification and j as the agent ID such that j = i. We aim to satisfy the utility objective of the information bottleneck, I(M j ; Y i ), through contrastive learning as shown in figure 1. Proposition 5.1. Utility mutual information is lower bounded by the contrastive NCE-binary objective, The proof is in Appendix A.1. This result shows a need for gradient information to flow backward across agents along communication edge connections. Experiments and Results\n\nWe condition on inputs, especially rich information (such as pixel data), and task-specific information. When evaluating an artificial language in MARL, we are interested in referential tasks, in which communication is required to complete the task. With regard to intent-grounded communication, we study ordinal tasks, which require coordination information between agents to complete successfully. Thus, we consider tasks with a team of agents to foster messaging that communicates coordination information that also includes their observations. To test H1, structuring emergent messages enables lower complexity, we test our methodology and analyze the input-oriented information and utility capabilities.",
      "A set of these tokens makes a message m.\nTo satisfy the complexity objective, we want to use m i to well-represent h i and consist of independently informative m i l . Independent Information\n\nWe derive an upper bound for the interaction information between all tokens. Proposition 4.1. For the interaction information between all tokens, the following upper bound holds: The proof is in Appendix A.1. Since we want the mutual information to be minimized in our objective, we minimize,\n\nInput-Oriented Information\n\nIn order to induce complexity in the compositional messages, we additionally want to minimize the mutual information I(H; M ) between the composed message m and the encoded information h. We derive an upper bound on the mutual information that we use as a Lagrangian term to minimize. Proposition 4.2. For the mutual information between the composed message and encoded information, the following upper bound holds:\nThe proof is in Appendix A.1. Thus, we have our Lagrangian term, Conditioning on the input or observation data is a decentralized training objective. Sequence Length\n\nCompositional communication necessitates an adaptive limit on the total length of the sequence. Corollary 4.3. Repeat tokens, w, are redundant and can be removed. Suppose one predicts two arbitrary tokens, w k and w l . Given equation 1, it follows that there is low or near-zero mutual information between w k and w l . A trivial issue is that the message generator will predict every available token as to follow the unique token objective. Since the tokens are imbued with input-oriented information (equation 2), the predicted tokens will be based on relevant referential details. Thus, it follows that tokens containing irrelevant information will not be chosen. A nice optimization objective that follows from corollary 4.3 is that one can use self-supervised learning with an end-ofsequence (EOS) token to limit the variable total length of compositional message sequences.

      "This implies, y =\u21d2 a \u2212 . Since the transition is known, it follows that a \u2212 =\u21d2 s \u2212 f , a random future state. Thus, we have, \u03c0 This is similar to the proof for lemma A.5, but requires assumptions on messages m from the emergent language. We note that when m is random, the case defaults to lemma A.5. Thus, we assume we have at least input-oriented information in m given sufficiently satisfying equation 2. Given a sufficient emergent language, it follows that y =\u21d2 a + , where a + is an intention action based on m.\nSimilarly, since the transition is known, a + =\u21d2 s + f , a desired goal state along the trajectory. Thus, we have, \u03c0 R + (y|m) = p(s = s + f |y, m). Recall the following (as shown in ), which we have adapted to our communication objective, Proposition A.3 (rewards \u2192 probabilities). The Q-function for the goal-conditioned reward function r g (s t , m t ) = (1 \u2212 \u03b3)p(s = s g |y t ) is equivalent to the probability of state s g under the discounted state occupancy measure:\nand Lemma A.4. The critic function that optimizes equation 8 is a Q-function for the goal-conditioned reward function up to a multiplicative constant 1 The critic function f (s, m, s f ) = y enc(s f ) represents the similarity between the encoding y = enc(s, m) and the encoding of the future rollout s f . Given lemmas A.5 A.6 A.8 and proposition A.7, it follows that equation 8 is the NCE-binary (InfoMAX ) objective, \u00ce(M j , Y i ) = log \u03c3(f (s, m, s + f )) + log 1 \u2212 \u03c3(f (s, m, s \u2212 f )) which lower bounds the mutual information, I(M j , Y i ) \u2265 \u00ce(M j , Y i ). The critic function is unbounded, so we constrain it to [0, 1] with the sigmoid function, \u03c3( * ). We suppress the reliance on h since this is directly passed through. By definition of mutual information, we have, Our network model learns \u03c0 R + (y|m) from rolled-out trajectories, R + , using our policy. The prior of our network state, \u03c0 R \u2212 (y), can be modeled from rolling out a random trajectory, R\u2212. Unfortunately, it is intractable to model \u03c0 R + (y|m) and \u03c0 R \u2212 (y) directly during iterative learning, but we can sample y + \u223c \u03c0 R + (y|m) and y \u2212 \u223c \u03c0 R \u2212 (y) directly from our network during training."

    "choices": [
      "A) The asymmetric LDOS patterns are primarily caused by the influence of the Au(111) substrate, specifically the terrace edges, which create a potential modulation along the nanotube axis.",
      "B) The asymmetric LDOS patterns are a direct consequence of the different chiralities of the semiconducting SWNTs used in the experiments, leading to variations in the electronic band structure.",
      "C) The asymmetric LDOS patterns are primarily attributed to the differing scattering strengths of the defect pairs within each quantum dot, with the defect exhibiting a larger scattering strength contributing to a more pronounced curvature in the LDOS stripes.",
      "D) The asymmetric LDOS patterns are a result of the varying densities of impurities present in the 1,2-dichloroethane suspension used for SWNT deposition, leading to localized potential variations along the nanotube axis."

      "\\\\\n\\indent Another technique for achieving confinement in SWNTs makes use of artificial defects such as covalently bound oxygen or aryl functionalization groups on the side walls of semiconducting SWNTs, inducing deep exciton trap states allowing for single-photon emission at room temperature~\\cite{Htoon_2015,tunable_QD_defects}. Also, carrier confinement between defect pairs acting as strong scattering centers has been reported for mechanically induced defects~\\cite{Postma_SET} as well as for ion-induced defects with reported level spacings up to 200 meV in metallic SWNTs~\\cite{Buchs_PRL}. The latter technique, combined with recent progress in controlling defects structure and localization~\\cite{Robertson_2012,Yoon_2016,Laser_writing_2017} offers a high potential for engineering a broad set of SWNT-based quantum devices operating at room temperature. \\\\\n\\indent Here, we demonstrate confinement of electrons and holes in sub-10 nm QD structures defined by ion-induced defect pairs along the axis of semiconducting SWNTs. Using low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), bound states with level spacings of the order of 100 meV and larger are resolved in energy and space. By solving the one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation over a piecewise constant potential model, the effects of asymmetric defect scattering strength as well as the influence of the Au(111) substrate such as terrace edges on the bound states structure are remarkably well reproduced. By means of ab-initio calculations based on density functional theory and Green's functions, we find that single (SV) and double vacancies (DV) as well as chemisorbed nitrogen ad-atoms are good candidates to produce QDs with the experimentally observed features. These simulations also allow to study the scattering profile as a function of energy for different defect combinations. \\section{Experimental section}\n\nThe experiments have been performed in a commercial (Omicron) low temperature STM setup operating at $\\sim5$~K in ultra high vacuum.",
      "This leads to state broadening, measured between about 60 meV up to 120 meV in QD I and II, while the quantized states widths in ab-initio simulations vary between about 5 meV and 45 meV. This suggests that a better contrast of the experimental quantized states, especially in the valence band, could be achieved by lowering the nanotubes-substrate interaction through $e.g.$ the insertion of atomically thin insulating NaCl films~\\cite{Ruffieux_Nature_2016}. This would allow to gain more insight on the electronic structure of the QDs as well as in the associated scattering physics at the confining defects~\\cite{Buchs_PRL}. \n\n\\section{Conclusions and outlook} In summary, using low-temperature STM/STS measurements supported by an analytical model and ab-initio simulations, we have demonstrated that intrananotube quantum dots with confined electron and hole states characterized by energy level spacings well above thermal broadening at room temperature can be generated in semiconducting SWNTs by structural defects such as vacancies and di-vacancies, as well as nitrogen ad-atoms. These results, combined with recent progresses in type and spatial control in the formation of defects~\\cite{Robertson_2012,Yoon_2016,Laser_writing_2017} as well as chirality control~\\cite{tunable_QD_defects}, hold a high potential for applications in the design of SWNT based quantum devices. These include $e.g.$ electrically driven single-photon emitters operating at room temperature and telecom wavelength. In this context, the observation of quantum confinement effects in the emitted light of cut, sub-10 nm, semiconducting SWNTs~\\cite{Dai_2008} shall be seen as an additional motivation for investigating the optical properties of our \"QD with leads\" building-blocks. These would include $e.g.$ studying optical transitions selection rules for different types and configurations of defect pairs~\\cite{sel_rules_2006} associated with experimental studies such as photoluminescence~\\cite{Lefebvre06} combined to $g^{(2)}$ correlation measurements~\\cite{Hofmann_2013} in suspended SWNT devices as well as photocurrent imaging~\\cite{Buchs_Nat_comm} and spectroscopy~\\cite{Gabor_2009}.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nThe authors thank Ethan Minot, Lee Aspitarte, Jhon Gonzalez, Andres Ayuela, Omjoti Dutta and Arkady Krasheninnikov for fruitful discussions.",

      "Eagle in Atlanta -- atleagle.com: July 2012\nWhy Spaz's recruiting doesn't matter anymore After BC picked up another below the radar recruit, Spaz's most vocal critics were out again disparaging his recruiting class. I don't trust the recruiting rankings, but it does concern me that our commitments aren't drawing more interest from BCS teams. There is a similar concern on the Penn State front. There's plenty of speculation, but BC is not a factor among the rumored PSU transfers. But really none of it matters. Spaz is going to wrap up most of the recruiting this summer and then focus on the games come fall. While not inspiring, the plan is practical. There are two outcomes:\n1. Spaz has a losing season and gets fired. If this happens, our 2013 recruiting class will be a hodgepodge of current commits, a transfer or two and whatever our new coach can uncover. For a new guy Spaz's lower profile recruits might be an advantage. If they aren't valued, they are less likely to be poached by other programs. A new Head Coach can then exert a little effort in getting the Spaz commits to stay committed and spend more time on filling out the class. 2. Spaz has a winning season and keeps his job. In this scenario Spaz stays off the hot seat and has to finish filling out the 2013 recruiting class. With a little more job security he can use his last few scholarships on bigger names. He may even luck into a decent prospect who suddenly becomes available due to another school's coaching change (like he did with Rutgers last year). In this case Spaz doesn't waste time recruiting during the season and then picks up some low-hanging fruit. Spaz is never going to recruit an elite class. There are many contributing factors as to why, but mostly it is because Spaz is not a salesmen. And we shouldn't care. He's not going to change. It is just a matter of who will finish out this class four months from now.

      "Notice anyone missing? It is just a silly Youtbue video but I find it very telling that the school left out the Head Coach. This is college football. Your head coach is the face of the program. Ours isn't even mentioned in a direct marketing message to our most loyal customers. There are many likely explanations for Spaz's absence. He's not particularly good on camera. He's never really shown any sort of enthusiasm for this sort of thing. And I think BC has heard enough to know that Spaz is not very popular with our fan base. No reason to trot him out when it will just dampen excitement about the upcoming season. I like Bill McGovern and Doug Martin. Both are capable coordinators and leaders. Martin's been a head coach and I know McGovern wants to be one, so giving them face time is not a bad idea. Let's hope they are also given autonomy this year (which hasn't been Spaz's strong suit with coordinators). If these two are given real power, season ticket holders will probably be happy they renewed.

So when his ACC preview piece on Football Outsiders listed BC with a .500 record and a 3rd place finish in the division, I was pleasantly surprised. FO is betting on our returning players and the positive trends of the last few games of 2011. I still don't know what to think about the upcoming season, but my love for BC and articles like this have me looking on the bright side. BC is sending Emmett Cleary and Kaleb Ramsey to Greensboro to represent the school during ACC media days. I think this is actually a great sign for BC and for both players. I expected Cleary to have a break out season last year. He was good, but not all conference. Maybe this year is his chance to shine and get on NFL radars. Ramsey has always had the talent. His health and attitude have been bigger issues. If he is healthy and focused this year, he will be a game changer on D.\nHere is more on our newest recruit out of Cincinnati Truman Gutapfel.",

We like to blame the tailgating or Spaz or the schedule, but the reality is there are multiple factors. Just look at the attendance issues facing the most popular league in American sports -- the NFL. If they can't get butts in the seats, how can BC? The NFL has a few different solutions in play. Perhaps, BC can learn from them. Fewer Seats\nThe NFL is lowering the bar, so that blackout rules don't require sellouts. Blackouts are not an issue in college, but perhaps few seats will help demand and make Alumni seem full. I don't want to tear out seats, but maybe we can replace the bleachers with actual seats. That would take up more space, eliminate seats and improve the watching experience. The internet has added fluidity to the ticket market. It used to be BC fans would buy season ticket packages to assure themselves Notre Dame tickets or some other desirable game.",
      "Crystal Ball Run thinks it could happen. Ultimately it will come down to our record. In my opinion, this is how it would play out. Let me know your thoughts in the comments.\n4-8 or worse... Spaz is gone. Back to back 8 loss seasons would be too much. The diehards are already calling for his head. Another embarrassing and hard to watch season would kill goodwill among the casual BC fans. 8-4 or better... Spaz is safe. We have the talent and the schedule to be this good. I don't think it will happen, but if it does we will see Year 5 of the Spaz era. 6 or 7 wins... Spaz \"retires.\" He gets his money. He gets to go out with a winning record. He saves face.

While there is risk with any hire, the nice thing about a rising coordinator is that they've usually proven themselves adapt at one phase of the game and you have the chance to hire the next great football mind. Plus most coordinators come in hungry and hard working, looking to make the most of their first chance as a head coach. Because Spaz is a a defensive coach, I am sure BC fans will want a replacement with an offensive background, but that doesn't mean we should overlook these guys. Pat Narduzzi\nDefensive Coordinator, Michigan State\nUntil Bruce Feldman dropped his name as a Spaz replacement, I don't think many BC fans were even thinking about Narduzzi. On paper he's a very solid candidate. He's got BCS experience at Michigan State. The Spartans love him and recently gave him a huge raise. While they haven't been elite, I like what Michigan State has done under Dantonio (and Narduzzi). They overachieve given their talent base and work hard on the recruting front."

      "Moreover, in the technique there is the bias of the $l_2$ regularizer. Trying to overcome these problems, Decelle and Ricci-Tersenghi introduced a new method \\cite{Decelle14}, known as PLM + decimation: the algorithm maximizes the sum of the $L_i$,\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n    {\\cal L}\\equiv \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\mbox{L}_i\n    \\end{eqnarray}  \n    and, then, it recursively set to zero couplings which are estimated very small. We expect that as long as we are setting to zero couplings that are unnecessary to fit the data, there should be not much changing on ${\\cal L}$. Keeping on with decimation, a point is reached where ${\\cal L}$ decreases abruptly indicating  that relevant couplings are being decimated and under-fitting is taking place. Let us define  by $x$  the fraction of non-decimated couplings. To have a quantitative measure for the halt criterion of the decimation process, a tilted ${\\cal L}$ is defined as,\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\mathcal{L}_t &\\equiv& \\mathcal{L}  - x \\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{max}} - (1-x) \\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{min}} \\label{$t$PLF} \n   \\end{eqnarray}\n   where \n   \\begin{itemize}\n   \\item $\\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{min}}$ is the pseudolikelyhood of a model with independent variables.

On the last step, for an empty graph, i.e., $x=0$, $\\mathcal{L}$ takes the value $\\mathcal{L}_{\\rm min}$ and, hence, again $\\mathcal{L}_t =0$. In the intermediate steps, during the decimation procedure, as $x$ is decreasing from $1$ to $0$, one observes firstly that $\\mathcal{L}_t$ increases linearly and, then, it displays an abrupt decrease indicating that from this point on relevant couplings are being decimated\\cite{Decelle14}. In Fig. \\ref{Jor1-$t$PLF} we give an instance of this behavior for the 2D short-range XY model with ordered couplings.",

After a short review of techniques based on pseudo-likelihood and their formal generalization to the model we have tested their performances against data generated by means of Monte Carlo numerical simulations of known instances\nwith diluted, sparse, interactions. The main outcome is that the best performances are obtained by means of the  pseudo-likelihood method combined with decimation. Putting to zero (i.e., decimating) very weak bonds, this technique turns out to be very precise for  problems whose real underlying interaction network is sparse, i.e., the number of couplings per variable does not scale with number of variables. The PLM + decimation method is compared to the PLM + regularization method, with $\\ell_2$ regularization and to a mean-field-based method. The behavior of the quality of the network reconstruction is analyzed by looking at the overall sorted couplings and at the single site couplings, comparing them with the real network, and at the true positive curves in all three approaches. In the PLM +decimation method, moreover, the identification of the number of decimated bonds at which the tilted pseudo-likelihood is maximum allows for a precise estimate of the total number of bonds. Concerning this technique, it is also shown that the network with the most likely number of bonds is also the one of least reconstruction error, where not only the prediction of the presence of a bond is estimated but also its value.",

The figure shows the behaviour of $\\mathcal{L}_t$ for three different data sizes $M$. A clear data size dependence of the maximum point of  $\\mathcal{L}_t$, signalling the most likely value for decimation, is shown. For small $M$ the most likely number of  couplings is overestimated and for increasing $M$ it tends to the true value, as displayed in Fig. \\ref{PLF_peak_statistics}.

The error is seen to sharply rise al low temperature, incidentally, in the ordered case, for  $T<T_c \\sim 0.893$, which is the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature of the 2XY model\\cite{Olsson92}. However, we can see that if only $M=64$ samples are considered, $\\mbox{err}_J$ remains high independently on the working temperature. In the right plot of Fig. \\ref{PL-err-Jor1},  $\\mbox{err}_J$ is plotted as a function of $M$ for three different working temperatures $T/J=0.4,0.7$ and $1.3$. As we expect, \n $\\mbox{err}_J$  decreases as $M$ increases. This effect was observed also with mean-field inference techniques on the same model\\cite{Tyagi15}. To better understand the performances of the algorithms, in Fig. \\ref{PL-varTP-Jor1} we show several True Positive (TP) curves obtained for various values of $M$ at three different temperatures $T$. As $M$ is large and/or temperature is not too small,  we are able to reconstruct correctly all the couplings present in the system (see bottom plots)."

      "A Palm Bay man\u2019s Puerto Rican family bought local pills destined for the working class town of Holyoke, Mass. In Rhode Island, police pulled over a Lauderhill man caught speeding through Providence. They found 903 oxycodone tablets and 56 morphine pills in the car. Senior citizen and Tulane business graduate Joel Shumrak funneled more than 1 million pills into eastern Kentucky from his South Florida and Georgia clinics, much of it headed for street sales \u2014 an estimated 20 percent of the illicit oxycodone in the entire state. Van loads of pill-seekers organized by \u201cVIP buyers\u201d traveled from Columbus, Ohio, to three Jacksonville clinics, where armed guards handled crowd control (federal indictment) and doctors generated prescriptions totaling 3.2 million pills in six months. In Miami, Vinny Colangelo created 1,500 internet website names to entice drug users throughout the nation to one of his six South Florida pain clinics or pharmacies. Even the Mafia got in on the Florida oxy express action: A Bonanno crime family associate oversaw a local crew stocking up on Palm Beach and Broward pain clinic oxycodone, upstreaming profits to the New York family. At times, it seemed almost no section of the country was free of Florida-supplied pills: When Olubenga Badamosi was arrested driving his Bentley Continental in Miami in 2011, the Oregon man was one of two traffickers overseeing a crew smuggling South Florida oxycodone to sell in Salt Lake City, Seattle and Denver as well as Oregon, Nevada, Texas and even Alaska. Pharmacy delivers oxy \u2018pot of gold\u2019\nIt would be hard to overstate Florida\u2019s role in feeding the country\u2019s voracious appetite for oxycodone. Oxycodone 30-milligram tablets were favored by addicts. And in 2009 and 2010, roughly four of every 10 of those pills were sold in Florida. Small wonder: Of the nation\u2019s top 100 oxycodone-buying doctors, 90 were in Florida. Pharmacies, too, ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies.",
      "Superior Pharmacy not only filled oxycodone prescriptions for pain clinics, it shared waiting room space with a pain clinic in a Temple Terrace strip mall outside Tampa. Neither Masters nor Superior had so much as Googled the background of pain clinic doctors writing those prescriptions, the DEA later said. Had they done so, the DEA dryly noted, they \u201cwould likely have come across a press release\u201d announcing one of the doctors had been arrested and charged with trafficking in prescription drugs. Hundreds of thousands of oxycodone pills were sent from Ohio distributors to Florida pharmacies. Unknown thousands of pills headed right back up to Ohio. When Ohio police burst into Christopher Thompson\u2019s home outside Columbus, they found an assault rifle, $80,000 in cash and oxycodone from his Florida deals. A construction worker whose own pill habit started at age 14, Thompson oversaw a ring of 15 Ohio buyers who traveled to Florida to pick up oxycodone to resell in Central Ohio. Two hours to the west in Martin\u2019s Ferry, David L. Kidd orchestrated a ring of buyers traveling to West Palm Beach and Central Florida to pick up oxycodone for resale on the streets of eastern Ohio and West Virginia. Doctors and pharmacies from Florida were complicit with Kidd\u2019s ring in fueling Ohio\u2019s opioid epidemic, wrote the U.S. attorney for West Virginia after Kidd\u2019s 2011 arrest: \u201cThe steady flow of pain pills into the Ohio Valley from Florida must stop.\u201d Driving To Pick Up Death By Rx\nWith more drugs came more deaths, in January 2010, say police, Fort Lauderdale pathologist Dr. Lynn Averill started a seven-month oxycodone shopping spree, buying 437,880 oxycodone pills from drug distributors. The same month, Matthew Koutouzis drove from Toms River, N.J., to see Averill in her Broward County pain clinic. The 26-year-old collected prescriptions for 390 pills and overdosed two days later. Brian Moore traveled 13 hours from his Laurel County, Ky., home to see Averill. He left with prescriptions for 600 pills and also overdosed within 48 hours.",
      "How Oxycontin, Florida and the Sackler Family Created the Opioid Crisis In America\nWhy are the Sacklers worth $13 billion today? Answer: \u201cThe Oxy Express Explained\u201d\n(MASS TORT NEXUS MEDIA)\nA COMPARISON OF OXYCODONE PRESCRIBING\nIn the first six months of 2010, Ohio doctors and health care practitioners bought the second-largest number of oxycodone doses in the country at just under 1 million pills. Florida doctors bought 40.8 million in the same period, the comparison is astounding, yet it flew under the DEA, Opioid Big Pharma and everyone elses radar for years and years. Of the country\u2019s top 50 oxycodone-dispensing clinics, 49 were in Florida. From August 2008 to November 2009, a new pain clinic opened in Broward and Palm Beach counties on average of every three days. Pharmacies and distributors are at fault as well, pharmacies ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from opioid drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies. 90 of 100 of the nation\u2019s top 100 oxy-buying doctors in 2010, were in Florida. 49 of 50 of the country\u2019s top oxy-dispensing clinics were in Florida. For some reason this didn\u2019t raise an alarm or cause anyone to look further at the time. Purdue Pharma New What Was Happening In Florida\nPurdue and the Sacklers chose to ignore Florida, because apparently nobody there sued them or complained. In 2007, in other states, the infamous drug maker and three of its executives pled guilty in federal court and paid out $634.5 million in fines for purposefully misleading regulators, doctors, and patients about the addictiveness of their opioid painkiller. Around the same time, Purdue was also sued by several states, including Washington, over similar allegations. Purdue agreed to a $19.5 million multi-state settlement. And in 2015, Purdue settled a case with Kentucky, agreeing to pay $24 million. As part of the state settlements, Purdue was supposed to set up monitoring programs to make sure that its opioid drug didn\u2019t wind up in the wrong hands. It was supposed to watch out for shady pharmacies, unusually large orders, or suspiciously frequent orders.",
      "Smith stopped selling to pain clinics. But the company continued to shovel millions of oxycodone pills to Florida pharmacies. Masters executives figured the pharmacies would keep an eye out for excessive prescriptions written by pill mill doctors. But not all pharmacies were worrying about doctors at pain clinics, many pharmacies were courting the pill mills prescribers. A Lake Worth Family Pharmacy\nIn 2009, the small pharmacy off Lucerne Avenue in Lake Worth had a history. It had been in business for 43 years. The owner and head pharmacist had been there for 32. It had shaded parking and a downtown location, a stone\u2019s throw from the City Hall Annex. When a Masters inspector visited, he was alarmed to find Tru-Valu Drugs bustling with a long line of young, thin, tattooed customers arriving in groups of 10 to pick up pills. There were signs in the pharmacy warning of limits on the number of oxycodone pills handed out. Even Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, an oxycodone manufacturer, was worried about the volume of its pill sales there. Of the 300,000 doses of all drugs the small pharmacy dispensed in December 2008, 192,000 were for oxycodone 30 mg, the dosage preferred by traffickers and users alike. The huge oxycodone volume was no accident. The owner and head pharmacist, unidentified in DEA records, told a Masters inspector that the pharmacy \u201chas pushed for this (narcotic) business with many of the area pain doctors.\u201d And, despite the torrent of oxycodone going out the door, the pharmacy owner expressed frustration that drug distributors were limiting the amount of narcotics they would sell to his now-closed pharmacy. Ohio to Florida and Back\nPharmacy after pharmacy benefited from the combination of Masters\u2019 Ohio oxycodone business and Florida\u2019s unregulated pill mills. In Englewood, north of Fort Myers, the pharmacy owner filled prescriptions for six pain clinics \u2014 including clinics an hour\u2019s drive away. A Masters inspector found cars from Tennessee and Kentucky in the parking lot and young men leaving the pharmacy carrying large trash bags."

      "for details. The chosen rank of each case is also shown in Table . Figure shows the comparison of original excitations and reconstructed results of these three cases, which all have excellent agreement. show the results computed by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. In all cases, the sums of the first three orders of responses agree well with those obtained by the Runge-Kutta method. The contributions of the first three orders of responses for each case are plotted in Figs. )-21(b). Similarly, the system vibration is dominated by the first-order response. However, the contributions of second-and third-order significantly grow with increasing excitation magnitude and frequency number. Furthermore, when the magnitude of the nonlinear response becomes large, sharp troughs are present. This phenomenon may be induced by the nonlinear stiffness. While the first-order response fails to capture these troughs, the higher-order responses successfully capture these troughs. Figure plots the computational time to calculate the response of the oscillator for the irregular loading in Case 1 by the proposed method and the fourth-fifth order Runge-Kutta method, respectively. While the fourth-fifth order Runge-Kutta method is more efficient under a small response length, the proposed method becomes much more efficient when the response length is larger than about 130 s. In addition, the proposed method obtains the explicit response solution, so one can directly obtain the response value at a specific time t p instead of integrating from 0 to t p for traditional numerical methods. Computation time (sec.)

When the Volterra kernel functions are known, we can follow the procedure in Section 4.1 to predict system responses.",
      "All cases have same amplitudes. The poles of a sinusoidal excitation are \u03bb 1,2 = \u00b1i\u2126, and the residues are \u03b1 1,2 = \u2213iA/2. Numerical values of excitation poles and residues for different cases are listed in Table . Table : Parameter values, poles and residues of the sinusoidal excitation Substituting poles and residues of the excitation, as well as those of the system into Eqs.\n20 and 19, response coefficients \u03b2 p i ,k corresponding to system poles \u2212a i and response coefficients \u03b3 p i ,\u2113 corresponding to excitation poles \u03bb \u2113 are calculated, respectively. According to Eq. 22, the first three orders of responses for each case in Table are calculated. Figures )-15(a) show the comparison of responses obtained by the proposed method and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with \u2206t = 10 \u22124 . For Cases 1 and 2, the first-order responses agree well with the total responses obtained by the Runge-Kutta method, and the higher-order responses only slightly improve the transient parts. For Cases 3-5, the sum of the first three orders of responses is in good agreement with the Runge-Kutta solution. When the response nonlinearity increases, higher-order responses need to be considered. In other words, the proposed method can accurately compute the nonlinear responses by choosing a small number N of Volterra series terms. Figures )-15(b) show the contributions of the three response components for the five cases. In each case, the first-order response is the most dominant component, and the contributions of secondand third-order responses are much less than those of the first-order response. Especially for Cases 1 and 2, whose excitation frequencies are far from the linear natural frequency, second-and thirdorder responses are close to zero. This may be because the QFRF and CFRF approach zero when the frequency is larger than 4 rad/s (see Figs. ). Furthermore, the mean values of the first-order responses are approximately zero, and those of the second-order responses are always smaller than zero, which are the difference frequency components in Eq. 27.",
      "Moreover, it is clearly observed that second-order responses for Cases 3-5 exhibit a periodic oscillation with a period near half of that for the first-order response, which is excited by the sum frequency component of the excitation (see second part of Eq. 27). Compared with steady-state solutions of first-and second-order responses, those of third-order responses in Cases 3-5 are no longer single regular motions. By performing the FFT, frequency spectra of these three third-order responses are shown in Fig. . We find that these three third-order responses are all dominated by their own fundamental harmonic component and the third harmonic (triple frequency) component. Figure shows the computational time to calculate the response of the oscillator for Case 1 by the proposed method, the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and the convolution method. The proposed method, which has an explicit solution, is much more efficient in computational time than the latter two methods, which need small time steps to obtain high-precision solutions. In particular, the efficiency of the proposed method increases with the length of the response time.

Table lists three cases of these parameters. In each case, the amplitudes of all components are the same, and phase angles \u03b8 n uniformly distributed between 0 and 2\u03c0 are randomly generated. To decompose the excitation into a pole-residue form, the Prony-SS method is used, whose concept is similar to that of a principal component method. The readers are referred to Ref.",
      "In this study, the input excitation is white noise with a constant power spectrum S 0 = 0.001, and the corresponding response is obtained by solving Eq. 28 by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, which is shown in Fig. . From Section 4.1, we determine that the sum of the first two orders of responses agrees well with the total response. In this study, the order of Volterra series N is chosen to be 2, damping rates of Laguerre polynomials are a 1 = a 2 = 2, and numbers of Laguerre polynomials are R 1 = R 2 = 24. To estimate the first two orders of Volterra kernel functions, a matrix equation is constructed using excitation data and response data. By using the least square method to solve this matrix equation, coefficients c p 1 and c p 1 p 2 in Eq. 8 are identified. Figure plots c p 1 and c p 1 p 2 , respectively, which have good agreement with the exact results in Fig. . Then, the first two order Volterra kernel functions are constructed by Eq. 6. Compared with the exact results in Figs. , the identified Volterra kernel functions in Fig. completely agree well with the exact solutions. Note that the white noise excitation, which can excite more frequency components of the response, is chosen to obtain good Volterra kernel functions. A regular excitation f (t) = sin(\u03c0t) and an irregular excitation f (t) = N f n=1 A n cos(\u2126 n t + \u03b8 n ) with A n = 0.3 and \u2126 n varying from 0 to 40 with equal interval 1 are chosen as input excitations. The predicted responses, along with results obtained by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, are shown in Fig. . In both cases, the proposed method accurately predicts system responses. As presented in Eq. 23, a nonlinear response is the sum of three terms: natural response y s (t), forced response y f (t) and cross response y c (t). These individual terms, as well as their sum to two excitations, are shown in Figs. 27 and 28, respectively. As shown in Figs. and 28, both first-and second-order responses include the natural response y s (t) and the forced response y f (t), but the cross response y c (t) only exists in second-order responses."

Also, the spatial profile of the obtained bound states (see lower subpanels in Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_N}(a) and (b)) reproduces the experimental features quite well. Note also that one can distinguish an isolated state in the experimental LDOS at an energy level between m1 and m2, about in the middle of the QD. This state that prevented an accurate fit of the state m2 in the right QD part is attributed to a spatial feature visible in the STM topography image in Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_Ar}(d) (see also supplementary information, Fig.S2(f)), probably a physisorbed impurity which does not affect the LDOS significantly. \\\\\n\\subsection{Ab-initio calculations}\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=16cm]{Figure_4.pdf}\n  \\caption{\\label{num_data} (a)-(c) LDOS ab-initio simulations of a semiconducting $(16,0)$ SWNT with combinations of vacancies defects separated by 11.1 nm.",
      "Increasing both barrier heights simultaneously shifts the bound state energy levels and level spacings up. This leads to sharper bound states as the confinement in the QD is made stronger thus increasing the lifetime of the confined electrons. Increasing the barrier thickness with constant inner edge separation does not affect much the level spacings but further sharpens the bound states. Any asymmetry introduced by a change in the width or height of one single barrier leads to broader bound states. The presence of a potential step modifies the LDOS in lifting the levels of the bound states, with a more pronounced effect on the lower states. In QD I and II, the center of each barrier is aligned with the center of the gap states ($d3'$-$d4$ for QD I and $d6'$-$d7$ in QD II) and the width ratio is kept proportional to the ratio of the spatial extent of the gap states. Thus, by increasing the width of the barriers, we decrease the length of the QD leading to higher level spacings, and vice versa. The experimental level spacings can then be approximated by tuning both barrier widths in the same ratio and the heights individually, knowing that the scattering strength of $d3'$ ($d7$) is larger than $d4$ ($d6'$) according to the observed asymmetry in the LDOS described above \\footnote{The transmission probability through a rectangular tunneling barrier is given by $T=\\left( 1+\\frac{V^{2}\\sinh^{2}\\left( a \\cdot \\sqrt{2m^{*}(V-E)}/\\hbar \\right)}{4E(V-E)} \\right)^{-1}$, where $V$ and $a$ are respectively the barrier height and width. For the argument in the $\\sinh$ sufficiently small such that $\\sinh(x)\\simeq x$, it can be shown that $a$ and $V$ can be coupled such that the transmission probability becomes a function of the area under the barrier $A=a\\cdot V$, with $T=\\left( 1+ \\frac{m^{*}A^{2}}{2\\hbar^{2}E} \\right)^{-1}$. In our case, this condition is not satisfied and thus the barrier geometries are tuned empirically to fit the experimental level spacings.}. \\\\\n\\indent For QD I, we find a good match in the conduction band for the barrier heights $V_\\mathrm{d3'}=1$ eV and $V_\\mathrm{d4}=0.85$ eV, widths $a_\\mathrm{d3'}=a_\\mathrm{d4}=$ 3.4 nm,  and potential step $V_\\mathrm{L}-V_\\mathrm{R}=60$ meV. With these parameters, the spatial profile of the obtained quantized states (see lower subpanels in Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_Ar}(a) and (c)) reproduces the experimental modulation features remarkably well.",
      "We estimated the level spacings in the conduction band of QD I to 98 meV (m1-m2) and 116 meV (m2-m3). For QD II, we measured 122 meV (m1-m2), 185 meV (m2-m3) and 210 meV (m3-m4). \\\\\n\\indent In the valence band of SWNT I, discrete states with level spacings of the order of 80-90 meV, with one clear maximum at the level m-1, can also be distinguished between defect sites $d3'-d4$ in Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_Ar}(b). The discretization of the states indicates that this QD structure also confines holes. Discrete states starting from m-2 and lower show less well defined structures compared to the conduction band states. In the case of SWNT II, no clear discrete states are observed in the valence band (see supplementary information). These observations are most probably the result of an energy dependent scattering strength of the defects, respectively $d3'$-$d4$ and $d6'$-$d7$, leading here to a weaker confinement in the valence band. Such energy dependence is well known for metallic SWNTs~\\cite{Chico96,vac_2007,mayrhofer:2011,Bockrath_Science01} and is corroborated by our ab-initio calculations. Note that mixing effects with defect states and substrate-induced effects~\\cite{substrate_effects} cannot be ruled out. \\\\\n\\indent Another remarkable feature in the LDOS is the strong spatial asymmetry of the lowest energy states m1 and m-1 in QD I and m1 in QD II. In QD I, m1 is shifted to the right side of the dot while m-1 is shifted to the left side. Higher states m2 and m3 show more symmetry in terms of position of the maxima relative to the center of the QD. In QD II, m1 is shifted to the right side of the QD. We attribute the observed lowest energy states asymmetry (for electrons as well as for holes) in part to their strong sensitivity to weak potential modulations within the QD structure (as we will show in section \\ref{1D}). For QD I, this assertion is supported by the observation of a 0.25 nm high Au(111) terrace edge located around the center of the QD, leading to a supported-suspended interface (see white dashed lines in Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_1}(b) and more topographic details in Fig.~S2(a)-(d) in supplementary information).",
      "Such configurations have been reported to induce a rigid shift in the SWNT bands~\\cite{Clair_2011}, for instance here a down-shift in the right side of QD I corresponding to the \"suspended\" portion between two terraces. In QD II, we attribute the spatial shift of m1 to a potential modulation induced by a layer of disordered impurities, most probably residua from the 1,2-dichloroethane suspension, lying between the gold substrate and the SWNT (see Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_1}(d) and Fig.~S2(e)-(h) in supplementary information). \\\\\n\\indent Also, the LDOS in QD I and II (Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_Ar}(a) and Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_N}(a), respectively) reveals asymmetric patterns with curved stripes oriented from top left to bottom right for QD I and from bottom left to top right for QD II. These are characteristic signatures for defect pairs with different scattering strengths~\\cite{Bercioux_prb_2011,Buchs_PRL}. For instance here, the left defect in QD I ($d3'$) has a larger scattering strength than the right one ($d4$), while the right defect in QD II ($d7$) has a larger scattering strength than the left one ($d6'$). \\\\\n\\indent The exact atomic structure of the defects could in principle be determined from a comparison of $dI/dV$ spectra with simulated first-principle LDOS signatures of expected defect types. In reality, this is hampered by the large number of possible geometries to simulate, including complex multiple defect structures~\\cite{Buchs_Ar}, together with the large unit cells of the semiconducting chiral SWNTs studied here. \\\\\n\\subsection{1D piecewise constant potential model}\n\\label{1D}\nTo better understand the physical origins of the non-trivial signatures of the quantized states, we model the experimental $dI/dV$ maps by solving the time independent one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation over a piecewise constant potential model of QD I and QD II. The scattering centers are approximated by semi-transparent rectangular tunneling barriers leading to a square confinement potential~\\cite{Laird:2015}."

The RSU is equipped with an RF antenna which can track the vehicles' trajectories after decoding the received RF signals. RSU aims to learn the interaction between the RF signals received from multiple vehicles and their corresponding trajectories. \\section{Proposed method for joint detection of GPS spoofing and jamming}\n\n\\subsection{Environment Representation}\nThe RSU is receiving RF signals from each vehicle and tracking its trajectory (which we refer to as GPS signal) by decoding and demodulating the received RF signals. The Generalized state-space model describing the $i$-th signal evolvement at multiple levels embodies the following equations: \n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq_discreteLevel}\n    \\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{t}}^{(i)} = \\mathrm{f}(\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{t-1}}^{(i)}) + \\mathrm{\\tilde{w}}_{t},\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq_continuousLevel}\n    \\mathrm{\\Tilde{X}_{t}}^{(i)} = \\mathrm{A} \\mathrm{\\Tilde{X}_{t-1}}^{(i)} + \\mathrm{B} \\mathrm{U}_{\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{t}}^{(i)}} + \\mathrm{\\tilde{w}}_{t},\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq_observationLevel}\n    \\mathrm{\\Tilde{Z}_{t}}^{(i)} = \\mathrm{H} \\mathrm{\\Tilde{X}_{t}}^{(i)} + \\mathrm{\\tilde{v}}_{t},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $i \\in \\{$RF, GPS$\\}$ indicates the type of signal received by the RSU.",
      "\\end{equation}\n\n\\subsection{Joint Prediction and Perception}\nRSU starts predicting the RF signals it expects to receive from each vehicle based on a Modified Markov Jump Particle Filter (M-MJPF) \\cite{9858012} that combines Particle filter (PF) and Kalman filter (KF) to perform temporal and hierarchical predictions. Since the acquired C-GDBN allows predicting a certain signal's dynamic evolution based on another's evolution, it requires an interactive Bayesian filter capable of dealing with more complicated predictions. To this purpose, we propose to employ an Interactive M-MJPF (IM-MJPF) on the C-GDBN. The IM-MJPF consists of a PF that propagates a set of $L$ particles equally weighted, such that $\\{\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t,l}^{(1)}, \\mathrm{W}_{t,l}^{(1)}\\}{\\sim}\\{\\pi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(1)}), \\frac{1}{L}\\}$, where $\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t,l}^{(1)}$, $l \\in L$ and $(.^{(1)})$ is the RF signal type. In addition, RSU relies on $\\Phi$ defined in \\eqref{interactiveTM_fromRFtoGPS} to predict $\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(2)}$ realizing the discrete cluster of vehicle's trajectory starting from the predicted RF signal according to: $\\{\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(2)},\\mathrm{W}_{t,l}^{(2)}\\}{\\sim} \\{\\Phi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t,l}^{(1)}){=}\\mathrm{P}(.|\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t,l}^{(1)}), \\mathrm{W}_{t,l}^{(2)}\\}$. For each predicted discrete variable $\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t,l}^{(i)}$, a multiple KF is employed to predict multiple continuous variables which guided by the predictions at the higher level as declared in \\eqref{eq_continuousLevel} that can be represented probabilistically as $\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)}, \\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)})$. The posterior probability that is used to evaluate expectations is given by:\n\\begin{multline} \\label{piX}\n    \\pi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})=\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)},\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t-1}^{(i)})= \\\\ \\int \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)}, \\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}) \\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)})d\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)},\n\\end{multline}\nwhere $\\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)}){=}\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t-1}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)})$. \nThe posterior distribution can be updated (and so representing the updated belief) after having seen the new evidence $\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}$ by exploiting the diagnostic message $\\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})$ in the following form: $\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}, \\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}) { =} \\pi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})\\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})$. Likewise, belief in discrete hidden variables can be updated according to: $\\mathrm{W}_{t,l}^{(i)}{=}\\mathrm{W}_{t,l}^{(i)}\\lambda (\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)})$ where:\n$\\lambda (\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}) {=} \\lambda (\\mathrm{\\Tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\Tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}) {=} \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\Tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\Tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)})$.\n\n\\subsection{Joint GPS spoofing and jamming detection}\nRSU can evaluate the current situation and identify if V2I is under attack, or the satellite link is under spoofing based on a multiple abnormality indicator produced by the IM-MJPF. The first indicator calculates the similarity between the predicted RF signal and the observed one, which is defined as:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq_CLA1}\n    \\Upsilon_{\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}} = -ln \\bigg( \\mathcal{BC} \\big(\\pi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}),\\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}) \\big) \\bigg),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{BC}(.){=}\\int \\sqrt{\\pi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}),\\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}})d\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}$ is the Bhattacharyya coefficient.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "documentation": [
      "Beyond the previous discussion about whether positive or negative returns are simultaneously or individually affected by age and market capitalization, we have also categorized the direction of the trend imposed by these two quantities on the power-law exponents. Blue rectangles in Fig. represent the fraction of relationships for which increasing age or market capitalization (or both) is associated with a raise in the power-law exponents. About 28% of all cryptocurrencies exhibit this pattern in which large price variations are expected to occur less frequently as they grow and age. Conversely, the red rectangles in Fig. depict the fraction of relationships for which increasing age or market capitalization (or both) is associated with a reduction in the power-law exponents. This case comprises about 25% of all cryptocurrencies for which large price variations are likely to become more frequent as they grow in market capitalization and age. Still, the majority of associations represented by green rectangles refer to the case where the effects of age and market capitalization point in different directions (e.g. exponents increasing with age while decreasing with market capitalization). About 36% of cryptocurrencies fit this condition which in turn contributes to consolidating the cumbersome hierarchical structure of patterns displayed by cryptocurrencies regarding the dynamics of large price variations. This complex picture is not much different when considering only cryptocurrencies in the top 200 market capitalization rank (Supplementary Figure ). However, we do observe an increased prevalence of patterns characterized by exponents that rise with age and market capitalization (37%), suggesting that large price variations are becoming less frequent among the top 200 cryptocurrencies than in the overall market.\n). Each of the previous three levels is further classified regarding whether both positive and negative returns are simultaneously affected or whether the effect involves only positive or only negative returns.",
      "Using a hierarchical Bayesian linear model, we have also simultaneously investigated the overall market characteristics and asset-specific tendencies regarding the effects of age and market capitalization on the power-law exponents. We have found that the cryptocurrency market is highly heterogeneous regarding the trends exhibited by each cryptocurrency; however, only a small fraction of cryptocurrencies (10%) have power-law exponents neither correlated with age nor market capitalization. These associations have been mostly ignored by the current literature and are probably related to the still-early developmental stage of the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Overall, 36% of cryptocurrencies present trends that do not systematically contribute to increasing or decreasing their power-law exponents as they age and grow in market capitalization. On the other hand, for 26% of cryptocurrencies, aging and growing market capitalization are both associated with a reduction in their power-law exponents, thus contributing to the rise in the frequency of large price variations in their dynamics. Only about 28% of cryptocurrencies present trends in which the power-law exponents increase with age and market capitalization, favoring thus large price variations to become less likely. These results somehow juxtapose with findings about the increasing informational efficiency of the cryptocurrency market . In fact, if on the one hand the cryptocurrency market is becoming more informationally efficient, then on the other our findings indicate that there is no clear trend toward decreasing the risks of sizable variations in the prices of most considered cryptoassets. In other words, risk and efficiency thus appear to be moving towards different directions in the cryptocurrency market. To conclude, we hope that our findings will contribute significantly to the better understanding of the dynamics of large price variations in the cryptocurrency market as a whole, and not just for a small subset of selected digital assets, which is especially relevant due to the diminishing concentration of market capitalization among the top digital currencies, and also because of the considerable impact these new assets may have in our increasingly digital economy.",
      "Finally, the former levels are classified regarding whether the power-law exponents increase, decrease or have a mixed trend with the predictive variables. Overall, 36% of the associations are classified as mixed trends (green rectangles), 28% are increasing trends (blue rectangles), and 26% are decreasing trends (red rectangles). We have studied the distributions of large price variations of a significant part of the digital assets that currently comprise the entirety of the cryptocurrency market. Unlike previous work, we have estimated these distributions for entire historical price records of each digital currency, and we have identified the patterns under which the return distributions change as cryptoassets age and grow in market capitalization. Similarly to conventional financial assets , our findings show that the return distributions of the vast majority of cryptoassets have tails that are described well by power-law functions along their entire history. The typical power-law exponents of cryptocurrencies (\u03b1 \u223c 3) are, however, significantly smaller than those reported for conventional assets (\u03b1 \u223c 4) . This feature corroborates the widespread belief that cryptoassets are indeed considerably more risky for investments than stocks or other more traditional financial assets. Indeed, we have found that about half of the cryptocurrencies in our analysis do not have a characteristic scale for price variations, and are thus prone to much higher price variations than those typically observed in stock markets. On the upside, we have also identified an asymmetry in the power-law exponents for positive and negative returns in about 2/3 of all considered cryptocurrencies, such that these exponents are smaller for positive than they are for negative returns. This means that sizable positive price variations have generally been more likely to occur than equally sizable negative price variations, which in turn may also reflect the recent overall expansion of the cryptocurrency market.",
      "Polygon (MATIC, rank 14) is an example where the power-law exponents associated with positive returns tend to increase with age and decrease with market capitalization. Finally, there are also cryptocurrencies with power-law exponents only associated with age. That is the case of Bitcoin (BTC, rank 1), Ethereum (ETH, rank 2), and Cardano (ADA, rank 8), for which the power-law exponents related to positive and negative returns increase with age, but also the case of Uniswap (UNI, rank 19), for which the exponents decrease with age. Figure systematically extends the observations made for the top 20 cryptoassets to all 2140 digital currencies for which we have modeled the changes in the power-law exponents as a function of age and market capitalization. First, we note that only 10% of cryptocurrencies have power-law exponents not significantly affected by age and market capitalization. The vast majority (90%) displays some relationship with these quantities. However, these associations are as varied as the ones we have observed for the top 20 cryptoassets. About 52% of cryptocurrencies have power-law exponents simultaneously affected by age and market capitalization. In this group, these quantities simultaneously impact the exponents related to positive and negative returns of 34% of cryptoassets, whereas the remainder is affected only in the positive tail (9%) or only in the negative tail (9%). Moving back in the hierarchy, we find that the power-law exponents of 32% of cryptocurrencies are affected only by age while a much minor fraction (6%) is affected only by market capitalization. Within the group only affected by age, we observe that the effects are slightly more frequent only on the exponents related to negative returns (12%), compared to cases where effects are restricted only to positive returns (10%) or simultaneously affect both tails (10%). Finally, within the minor group only affected by market capitalization, we note that associations more frequently involve only exponents related to negative returns (3%) compared to the other two cases (2% only positive returns and 1% for both positive and negative returns)."

In other words, don't stick to your own community. Don't just talk to the people who only agree with you. Go out and evangelize or proselytize to people who don't understand what this stuff is about. Do it in such a way that you are not superior or offputting; don't try to be right; try to win and expand this community, not in terms of pressure or rightness, but in terms of understanding what we are about.

      "So it is no longer true that national power and national security are increased when government has the sole right to gather intelligence and encipher communications. Now the strength of a country depends not only on its government, but also on its corporations. The old premises have fallen away in the new reality, but the old policy remains. It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage. Well, digital media -- computer-based communications -- are the printing press of the 21st century, and as the printing press transformed society, created the modern individual, gave rise to the basis of the democratic state and to the notion of individual rights, I suspect that we will see a similar, radical transformation of the very constitution of global society in the next century, facilitated by this enabling technology. I would be the last person to try to sketch out the details, or tell you what the issues are going to be, but I want to share with you some feelings about what is really going to matter, as we go about this -- and I'll start with something about myself. You see a guy wearing a suit; most of you know I have a lot of money -- I'm a successful businessman. God knows what images propagate around the media and settle in people's minds, but I've always seen myself, and felt myself to the core of my being, as an outsider, every bit as much as a self-proclaimed outsider, as Tom Jennings -- who spoke so eloquently about this at the Pioneer awards* yesterday -- was. *The Electronic Freedom Foundation presented its first awards at a related, adjacent reception which was not formally a part of the conference. I think we are all outsiders; we are all different, all unique. We're not the same. We share an underlying common humanity, but we should not be asked to subjugate ourselves to some form of mass society that causes us each to become indistinguishable from one another. I believe that computer- based communications technology is an enabling technology to liberate individuals and to free us from the oppressive influence of large institutions, whether those are public or private.",
      "And I think that -- I'm not espousing utopian vision -- there needs to be an utopian vision out there, so people have something to give them some inspiration. But values are a lot more important than technology. There are some values in this community -- and I'm not sure if it's an elite or a minority or both -- but it's really in the propagation of a sense of values about openness and tolerance, acting on that basis and living one's life, and saving capitalism from itself and things like that where we can make a difference. If some of the expressions are technological, that's fine. We are living in an era where people like buttons, and so on. If we do that well, the presidential candidates are going to be coming to us. LIASSON: You talk about Cyberspace not being ready for prime time -- I still want a definition of Cyberspace in 25 words or less -- but I think you want to transform prime time to a certain extent. DYSON: Mostly I agree with this, but the press does have two roles: one is collecting information and uncovering things, and the other is setting the agenda. If 12,000 voices are crying out, who's going to listen to them? Who's going to notice when they do discover that the President did something wrong? Again, it's a check and balance sort of thing, but there is a certain community that is created by collective media.\nKAPOR: Esther, what makes you believe that in Cyberspace Mara won't have two hours a day of her own that everyone listens to.

LIASSON: But you said before that instead of one global village, we have a lot of little global villages. I'm wondering if instead, we won't have millions of little huts. I mean individual huts. There are just so many different choices. LIASSON: What I'm wondering is, if everybody becomes their own producer, publisher, what does that mean for the future? KAPOR: I think we'll get a much more fluid, self-organizing state. I don't think in practice everybody is going to be what we think of today as a broadcast publisher.",

If he wants to get elected, I think the discussion would stop right now. DYSON: Let me just try a serious answer. I think what a candidate could say is, \"I'm no longer going to protect the textile industry, the peanut butter interests, the sugar guys, the antediluvian steel mills. If I'm going to have an industrial policy and help anyone, it's going to be new technology. I'm going to focus on investment in R&D. I am going to create a national infrastructure for telecommunications, just the way we created a highway system years ago. I'm going to put people to work doing these things.\" I think that would go over reasonably well. I think it's something most of us would agree on. (laughter) We have an industrial policy -- we might as well acknowledge it, and we might as well have it be forward-looking.\nKAPOR: Now there is something about the question as to whether this is presidential material that I think is ironic, given that most people really want to vote for \"none of the above.\" We know in our hearts that we have come to a particular period in history in which the presidential spectacle seems to be particularly irrelevant to whatever set of problems we have on our minds. As a great believer in democracy, I think this is incredibly lamentable. We need to do something about this, because there are a lot of issues, but Cyberspace is not ready for prime time. It would be trivialized -- I have seen what Geraldo did to hackers, and I don't need to see any more. It seems to me that the presidential candidates are really not the leaders that they ought to be, but are always putting their finger to the wind to see if they can detect some current of values or beliefs that can help get them elected."

All return time series in our analysis have at least 200 observations (see Supplementary Figure for the length distribution). Figure (a) illustrates Bitcoin's series of daily returns. To investigate whether and how returns have changed over the aging and growing processes of all cryptocurrencies, we sample all time series of log-returns using a time window that expands in weekly steps (seven time series observations), starting from the hundredth observation to the latest return observation.",
      "In each step, we separate the positive from the negative return values and estimate their power-law behavior using the Clauset-Shalizi-Newman method . Figure (a) further illustrates this procedure, where the vertical dashed line represents a given position of the time window (t = 2004 days), the blue and red lines indicate positive and negative returns, respectively, and the gray lines show the return observations that will be included in the expanding time window in future steps. Moreover, Fig. (b) shows the corresponding survival functions (or complementary cumulative distributions) for the positive (blue) and negative (red) returns of Bitcoin within the time window highlighted in Fig. (a). These survival functions correspond to return values above the lower bound of the power-law regime (r min ) and dashed lines in Fig. (b) show the power-law functions adjusted to data, that is,\nwith \u03b1 = 4.5 for the positive returns and \u03b1 = 3.0 for the negative returns in this particular position of the time window (t = 2004 days). We have further verified the goodness of the power-law fits using the approach proposed by Clauset et al. (see also Preis et al. ). As detailed in the Methods section, this approach consists in generating several synthetic samples under the power-law hypothesis, adjusting these simulated samples, and estimating the fraction of times the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between the adjusted power-law and the synthetic samples is larger than the value calculated from the empirical data. This fraction defines a p-value and allows us to reject or not the power-law hypothesis of the return distributions under a given confidence level. Following Refs. we consider the more conservative 90% confidence level (instead of the more lenient and commonly used 95% confidence level), rejecting the power-law hypothesis when p-value \u2264 0.1. For the particular examples in Fig. (b), the p-values are respectively 1.00 and 0.17 for the positive and negative returns, and thus we cannot reject the power-law hypotheses.",
      "Panels (c) and (d) show the distributions of these median exponents when considering the top 2000 and the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, respectively. We observe that the distributions of \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 tend to shift toward larger values when considering the largest cryptoassets. number of return observations (between 100 and 300 days) and filtering out cryptoassets with missing observations (Supplementary Figures ). Still, it is worth noticing the existence of a few cryptoassets (9 of them) with relatively small market capitalization (ranking below the top 1000) for which the power-law hypothesis is always rejected (Supplementary Table ). Having verified that large price movements in the cryptocurrency market are generally well-described by powerlaw distributions, we now focus on the power-law exponents that typically characterize each cryptoasset. To do so, we select all exponent estimates over the entire history of each digital asset for which the power-law hypothesis is not rejected and calculate their median values for both the positive ( \u03b1+ ) and negative ( \u03b1\u2212 ) returns. The dashed lines in Fig. ) show these median values for Bitcoin where \u03b1+ = 4.50 and \u03b1\u2212 = 2.99. It is worth noticing that the variance of large price movements \u03c3 2 is finite only for \u03b1 > 3, as the integral \u03c3 2 \u223c \u221e r min r 2 p(r)dr diverges outside this interval. Thus, while the typical variance of large positive returns is finite for Bitcoin, negative returns are at the limit of not having a typical scale and are thus susceptible to much larger variations. Figure shows the probability distribution for the median power-law exponents of all cryptoassets grouped by large positive and negative returns. We note that the distribution of typical power-law exponents associated with large positive returns is shifted to smaller values when compared with the distribution of exponents related to large negative returns. The medians of these typical exponents are respectively 2.78 and 3.11 for positive and negative returns.",

      "After sampling the entire price return series, we obtain time series for the power-law exponents (\u03b1 t ) associated with positive and negative returns as well as the corresponding p-values time series for each step t of the expanding time window. These time series allow us to reconstruct the aging process of the return distributions over the entire history of each cryptoasset and probe possible time-dependent patterns. Figures ) and 1(d) show the power-law exponents and p-values time series for the case of Bitcoin. The power-law hypothesis is never rejected for positive returns and rarely rejected for negative returns (about 4% of times). Moreover, the power-law exponents exhibit large fluctuations at the beginning of the time series and become more stable as Bitcoin matures as a financial asset (a similar tendency as reported by Begu\u0161i\u0107 et al. ). The time evolution of these exponents further shows that the asymmetry between positive and negative returns observed in Fig. ) is not an incidental feature of a particular moment in Bitcoin's history. Indeed, the power-law exponent for positive returns is almost always larger than the exponent for negative returns, implying that large negative price returns have been more likely to occur than their positive counterparts over nearly the entire history of Bitcoin covered by our data. However, while the difference between positive and negative exponents has approached a constant value, both exponents exhibit an increasing trend, indicating that large price variations are becoming less frequent with the coming-of-age of Bitcoin. The previous analysis motivates us to ask whether the entire cryptocurrency market behaves similarly to Bitcoin and what other common patterns digital currencies tend to follow. To start answering this question, we have considered the p-values series of all cryptocurrencies to verify if the power-law hypothesis holds in general. Figure (a) shows the percentage of cryptoassets rejecting the power-law hypothesis in at most a given fraction of the weekly positions of the expanding time window ( f r )."

We directly tie the quantum security parameter to the total number of surface code cycles (see~\\cite{10.1007/978-3-319-69453-5_18} for more details). We also add to the plot the theoretical lower bound achievable by quantum search in the cases of: a) considering the oracle a black box of unit cost (lower line), and b) considering the oracle as composed of ideal quantum gates, each of unit cost (upper line). Note that the difference between b) and a) represents the intrinsic cost of logical overhead (i.e. the overhead introduced by treating the oracle as a logical circuit and not a blackbox), whereas the difference between the upper lines and b) represents the intrinsic cost introduced by the fault-tolerant layer. \\item We plot the total wall-time per CPU (i.e. how long will the whole computation take on a parallel quantum architecture) as a function of the number of CPUs. The horizontal dashed line represents the one-year time line, i.e. the $x$ coordinate of the intersection point between the ``Total time per CPU'' line and the one-year time line provides the number of processors required to break the system within one year (in $\\log_2$ units).",
      "\\section{Introduction\\label{sct::intro}}\nSymmetric, public-key (asymmetric) and hash-based cryptography constitute a fundamental pillar of modern cryptography. Symmetric cryptography includes symmetric-key encryption, where a shared secret key is used for both encryption and decryption. Cryptographic hash functions map arbitrarily long strings to strings of a fixed finite length. Currently deployed public-key schemes are\nused to establish a common secret key between two remote parties. They are based on factoring large numbers or solving the discrete logarithm problem over a finite group. For more details about modern cryptography the interested reader can consult one of the many excellent references on the topic, e.g.~\\cite{Katz:2007:IMC:1206501}. In contrast to asymmetric schemes based on factoring or solving the discrete logarithm problem and which are completely broken by a quantum adversary via Shor's algorithm~\\cite{SJC.26.1484}, symmetric schemes and hash functions are less vulnerable to quantum attacks. The best known quantum attacks against them are based on Grover's quantum search algorithm~\\cite{PhysRevLett.79.325}, which offers a quadratic speedup compared to classical brute force searching. Given a search space of size $N$, Grover's algorithm finds, with high probability, an element $x$ for which a certain property such as $f(x)=1$ holds, for some function $f$ we know how to evaluate (assuming such a solution exists). The algorithm evaluates $f$ a total of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ times. It applies a simple operation in between the evaluations of $f$, so the $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ evaluations of $f$ account for most of the complexity. In contrast, any classical algorithm that evaluates $f$ in a similar ``black-box'' way requires on the order of $N$ evaluations of $f$ to find such an element. Any quantum algorithm can be mapped to a quantum circuit, which can be implemented on a quantum computer. The quantum circuit represents what we call the ``logical layer\". Such a circuit can always be decomposed in a sequence of ``elementary \ngates\", such as Clifford gates (CNOT, Hadamard etc.~\\cite{NC00}) augmented by a non-Clifford gate such as the T gate.",
      "Running a logical circuit on a full fault-tolerant quantum computer is highly non-trivial. The sequence of logical gates have to be mapped to \nsequences of surface code measurement cycles (see e.g.~\\cite{PhysRevA.86.032324} for extensive details). By far, the most resource-consuming (in \nterms of number of qubits required and time) is the T gate\\footnote{Clifford gates are ``cheap\", i.e. they require relatively small overhead for implementation in the surface code, but are not universals, hence a non-Clifford gate is required. One such gate is the T gate. There are other possible choices, however all of the non-Clifford gates require special techniques such as magic state distillation~\\cite{1367-2630-14-12-123011,PhysRevA.86.052329} and significant overhead (order of magnitudes higher than Clifford gates) to be implemented in the surface code. In fact, to a first order approximation, for the purpose of resource estimation, one can simply ignore the overhead introduced by the Clifford gates and simply focus only on the T gates.}. In comparison with surface code defects and braiding techniques~\\cite{PhysRevA.86.032324}, novel lattice surgery \ntechniques~\\cite{2018arXiv180806709F,1808.02892,1367-2630-14-12-123011} reduce the spatial overhead required for implementing T gates via magic state distillation by approximately a factor of 5, while also modestly improving the running time. In this paper we first analyze the security of symmetric schemes and hash functions against large-scale fault-tolerant quantum adversaries, using surface code defects and braiding techniques. We take into account the time-space trade-offs with parallelizing quantum search, down to the fault-tolerant layer. Naively, one might hope that $K$ quantum computers (or quantum ``processors'', as we will call them later in the paper) running in parallel reduce the number the circuit depth down to $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})/K$ steps, similar to the classical case of distributing a search space across $K$ classical processors.",
      "The curves above the purple line show the overhead introduced by fault tolerance (in terms of required surface code cycles, each surface code cycle assumed to have unit cost). More optimization at the logical layer will shift the purple line down, whereas more optimization at the fault-tolerant layer will move the upper curves closer to the purple line. Similar remarks to the above hold for the remaining plots in this manuscript.}\n      \t\\label{fgr:aes_128_cycles} For example, the plots in Fig.~\\ref{fgr:aes_128_cycles} tells us that if we have $2^{50}$ quantum computers running Grover's algorithm in parallel, with no physical errors, then it would take about $2^{63}$ gate calls (where the purple line intersects the vertical line at $50$), where we assume each gate to have unit cost. Still with no errors, a trivial cost for implementing the cryptographic function (oracle) would bring the cost down to about $2^{38}$ oracle calls per quantum computer. Keeping the actual function implementation, but adding the fault-tolerant layer with a physical error rate of $10^{-7}$ (with appropriate assumptions and using state-of-the-art quantum error correction) pushes the cost up to around $2^{76}$ surface code cycles per quantum computer (where now each code cycle is assumed to have unit cost). Similar remarks hold for the remaining plots in this manuscript. \\includegraphics[width=0.429\\textwidth]{figures/AES-128_time.pdf}\n      \t\\captionof{figure}{AES-128 block cipher. Required time per processor, as a function of the  number of processors ($\\log_2$ scale). The horizontal dotted line indicates one year. The $x$-axis is deliberately extended to show the necessary number of CPUs for a total time of one year. Thus the figure shows that it would take, with the stated assumptions, over $2^{80}$ parallel quantum searches to break AES-128 in a year.

      "For example, very recently, there have been several cryptanalysis results~\\cite{1712.06239} and~\\cite{1802.03856} that attempt to reduce breaking some symmetric algorithms to solving a system of non-linear equations. Solving these non-linear equations is then attacked using a modified version of the quantum linear equation solver algorithm~\\cite{PhysRevLett.103.150502}. The results are heavily dependent on the condition number of the non-linear system, which turns to be hard to compute (it is not known for most ciphers and hash functions such as AES or SHA). Provided the condition number is relatively small, then one may get an  advantage compared to brute-force Grover search. However at this time it is not clear whether this is indeed the case, and we do not have large-scale quantum computers to experiment with. The quantum security parameter (based on our assumptions of using state-of-the-art algorithms and fault-tolerance methods) for symmetric and hash-based cryptographic schemes is summarized in Table~\\ref{tbl1}.

      "At first, we obtain instant hand gestural and postural activities from our above proposed models, and additionally motion sensor and object sensor readings from our IoT-system for every time instant generating a 4-hierarchy of HDBN model. Considering the context set $\\langle gestural, postural, ambient,object\\rangle$ as a hierarchical activity structure (extending two 2-hierarchical HDBN \\cite{alam16b}), we build complex activity recognition model for single inhabitant scenario. Finally, we infer the most-likely sequence of complex activities (and their time boundaries), utilizing the well-known Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm \\cite{dempster77} for training and the Viterbi algorithm \\cite{forney73} for run-time inference. \\section{Automatic Activity Features Estimation}\nThe effects of cognitive ability on daily activity performance have been studied before \\cite{dawadi14,akl15}. They experimentally and clinically validated that cognitive impairment highly reduces the daily activity performances and this activity performance can be computed as an indicator of cognitive ability status of older adults. The standard activity features refer to completeness of task (TC), sequential task ability (SEQ), interruption avoidance capabilities (INT) etc. In current behavioral science literature, the above activity features carry specific definition based on the sub-tasks involved with a complex activity \\cite{dawadi14,akl15}. Completeness of task refers to how many sub-tasks are missed by the participants. Sequential task ability refers to how many sequences of sub-tasks are missed referring the gerontologist defined standard sequences of the sub-task for the particular complex activity. Interruption avoidance capability refers to how many times the participants stop or interleave while doing any sub-task. The final goal of activity features estimation is to provide overall task score. The task score is proportional to the functional ability of participants in performance daily activities.",
      "\\section{Activity Recognition}\nWe aim to detect single wrist-worn ACC sensor based hand gesture and postural activities and insert these into an HDBN graphical model in conjunction with ambient and object sensor values for complex activity recognition. We consider the recognition problem asan activity tupple of $\\langle gesture,posture,ambient,object \\rangle$. Though, Alam et. al. provides significant performance improvement for single wrist-worn ACC sensor aided 18-hand gesture based postural activity recognition in lab environment \\cite{alam17}, it faces some practical challenges in real-time smart environment with older adults due to the diversity of their postures. For example, some older adults use walker, double walking sticks or wheel chair for walking in which cases collecting 18 hand gestures and corresponding postural activities for training requires endless efforts and carefulness. To reduce the complexity of ground truth labeling and later state space explosion for graphical model (HDBN), we propose to use rotational normalization method that can merge some hand-gestures subject to directional differences and forms an 8-hand gesture model. However, our proposed Feature Weight Naive Bayes (FWNB) classifier adds significant improvement on Alam et. al. proposed sparse-deconvolution method as well as recognition in diverse postural environment. \\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\begin{center}\n   \\epsfig{file=hand_gestures.pdf,height=0.5in, width=3in}\n   \\vspace{-.2in}\n\\caption{8 hand gesture dictionary with direction}\n   \\label{fig:hand_gestures}\n   \\vspace{-.2in}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\\subsection{Hand Gesture Recognition}\n\\label{sec:hand_gesture}\n\\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposes an 8-gesture dictionary (as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:hand_gestures}) and a Feature Weighted Naive Bayesian (FWNB) framework for building, modeling and recognizing hand gestures. The method comprises of the following steps: (i) \\emph{Preprocessing:} wrist-worn ACC sensor provided 3-axis data are passed through 0.4Hz low-pass filter to remove the data drift.",
      "In \\emph{observation based activity features}, we design a complex activity set comprised of multiple subtasks which are involved with task {\\it interruption, completion and sequencing}. Participants are instructed to perform the complex activities while the trained evaluator observed the aforementioned functional activity performance measures. Each incorrect attempt of performance measure will be assigned one point thus higher score reflects lower performance of functional activities \\cite{dawadi14}. We first detect hand gesture and postural activities. Then, we feed the low-level activity contexts (gestural and postural) combined with ambient contexts (object and ambient motion sensor readings) into HDBN for single inhabitant model \\cite{alam16b} to recognize complex activities. The complex activity recognition framework provides both activity labels and activity window (start-end points). Then, we extract features of object sensor, ambient sensor, gestural activity and postural activity events for each activity window. The features are number of occurrences, mean number of occurrences, consecutive 1, 2, 3, $\\ldots$ 20 occurrences, top 10, 20, 30, $\\ldots$, 90 percentile etc (29 features in total). In \\emph{physiological features} we first detect 13 complex activities using HDBN algorithm which provides activity labels and activity window (start-end points), apply noise reduction, motion artifacts removal, extract 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features for each activity and take the mean of them over time (minutes) to get 15 (7+8) complex activity physiological features set for each participant. In summary, we extract 3 observation based activity features, 29 automatic activity performance features, 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features.\n\\subsection{Physiological Signal Processing Performance Evaluation}\nStandard evaluation technique should use both experimental and publicly available datasets to confirm the outperformance of the novel approaches.

      "Our behavioral scientist team, comprises with Nursing professor, gerontologist and retirement community caregivers, carefully discus, optimize and choose 87 sub-tasks in total for 13 complex activities. Each of the sub-task comprises with sequential occurrences of hand gesture and postural activities. However, no researchers ever considered hand gesture for activity features estimation due to complexity of multi-modal wearable and ambient sensors synchronization and multi-label activity classification \\cite{dawadi14,akl15}. \\emph{AutoCogniSys} exploited single wrist-worn sensor based hand gesture and postural activity recognition, and proposed an activity features (TC, SEQ and INT) estimation method including these two parameters in conjunction with object and ambient sensor features that provide significant improvement of cognitive health assessment of older adults. \\subsection{Machine Learning Based Complex Activity Features Estimation} In current cognitive health assessment literature, complex activity features can be defined as $\\langle TC,SEQ,INT,TS\\rangle$. We used supervised method to estimate TC, SEQ and INT, and unsupervised method to estimate TS. We first, formulate the automated scoring as a supervised  machine learning problem in which machine learning algorithms learn a function that maps $\\langle${\\it hand gesture, posture, object, ambient sensor}$\\rangle$ feature set to the direct observation scores. We use bagging ensemble method to learn the mapping function and SMO based SVM \\cite{cao06} as base classifier. The learner averages by boostrapping individual numeric predictions to combine the base classifier predictions and generates an output for each data point that corresponds to the highest-probability label. We train three classifiers considering observation as ground truth for TC, SEQ and INT scores and test on the testing dataset. We derive unsupervised scores using dimensionality reduction technique for each feature set. First, we take all features of each activity, apply optimal discriminant analysis technique as a dimensionality reduction process \\cite{zhang09} and reduce the feature sets into single dimensional value which represents the automated task completeness scores of the particular user activity.",
      "Then, we use sparse-deconvolution method (with 31\\% signal reconstruction error) to get Approximately Sparse Factor. The summary of the entire process is stated bellow:\n\n{\\it Building Deconvolution Method:} We first consider the wrist-worn ACC sensor signals (3-axis values) as a convolution of hand gesture and postural activity effects and build a deconvolution framework. The deconvolution framework takes a known signal (hand gesture effects) and a equalizer parameter ($\\lambda$) as input and provides an Approximately Sparse Factor signal (postural activity effects) as output. For 3-axis ACC signals, we need to learn associated 3 equalizer parameters for each hand gesture. Moreover, each equalizer parameter is involved with 4 postural activities that results a total 96 ($8\\times 3\\times 4$) equalizer parameters to learn. {\\it Learning Classification Model:} We use the Approximately Sparse Factor signal to extract 12 statistical features and SVM with sequential machine optimization (SMO) \\cite{cao06} for postural activity recognition. {\\it Prediction Model:} After recognizing the hand gestures following the method explained in Sec.~\\ref{sec:hand_gesture}, we take the corresponding reference vector as known signal and extract the Approximately Sparse Factor signals incorporating corresponding 3 equalizer parameters ($\\lambda$) for the sparse-deconvolution method.

      "Football Club Urartu (, translated Futbolayin Akumb Urartu), commonly known as Urartu, is an Armenian professional football team based in the capital Yerevan that currently plays in the Armenian Premier League. The club won the Armenian Cup three times, in 1992, 2007 and 2016. In 2013\u20132014, they won the Armenian Premier League for the first time in their history. In early 2016, the Russia-based Armenian businessman Dzhevan Cheloyants became a co-owner of the club after purchasing the major part of the club shares. The club was known as FC Banants until 1 August 2019, when it was officially renamed FC Urartu. History\n\nKotayk\nUrartu FC were founded as FC Banants by Sarkis Israelyan on 21 January 1992 in the village of Kotayk, representing the Kotayk Province. He named the club after his native village of Banants (currently known as Bayan). Between 1992 and 1995, the club was commonly referred to as Banants Kotayk. During the 1992 season, the club won the first Armenian Cup. At the end of the 1995 transitional season, Banants suffered a financial crisis. The club owners decided that it was better to merge the club with FC Kotayk of Abovyan, rather than disband it. In 2001, Banants demerged from FC Kotayk, and was moved from Abovyan to the capital Yerevan. Yerevan\n\nFC Banants was relocated to Yerevan in 2001. At the beginning of 2003, Banants merged with FC Spartak Yerevan, but was able to limit the name of the new merger to FC Banants. Spartak became Banants's youth academy and later changed the name to Banants-2. Because of the merger, Banants acquired many players from Spartak Yerevan, including Samvel Melkonyan. After the merger, Banants took a more serious approach and have finished highly in the league table ever since. The club managed to lift the Armenian Cup in 2007. Experience is making way for youth for the 2008 and 2009 seasons. The departures of most of the experienced players have left the club's future to the youth. Along with two Ukrainian players, Ugandan international, Noah Kasule, has been signed.",
      "The club headquarters are located on Jivani Street 2 of the Malatia-Sebastia District, Yerevan. Domestic\n\nEuropean\n\nStadium\n\nThe construction of the Banants Stadium was launched in 2006 in the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan, with the assistance of the FIFA goal programme. It was officially opened in 2008 with a capacity of 3,600 seats. Further developments were implemented later in 2011, when the playing pitch was modernized and the capacity of the stadium was increased up to 4,860 seats (2,760 at the northern stand, 1,500 at the southern stand and 600 at the western stand). Training centre/academy\nBanants Training Centre is the club's academy base located in the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan. In addition to the main stadium, the centre houses 3 full-size training pitches, mini football pitches as well as an indoor facility. The current technical director of the academy is the former Russian footballer Ilshat Faizulin. Fans\nThe most active group of fans is the South West Ultras fan club, mainly composed of residents from several neighbourhoods within the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan, since the club is a de facto representer of the district. Members of the fan club benefit from events organized by the club and many facilities of the Banants training centre, such as the mini football pitch, the club store and other entertainments.

      "A disappointing start to his season both in Spain and the ULEB cup made this European prodigy point guard fall on most team\u0092s draft boards, but Rodr\u00edguez picked things up substantially towards the end of the year and is now playing terrific basketball. Weak NCAA PG crop could put him in the lottery with good workouts. Dusan Sakota, 6-10, SF/PF, Panathinaikos 1986 Greece Undrafted Fairly unathletic perimeter oriented big man was in the draft last year already. Plays for one of the best teams in Europe and rarely sees the floor for meaningful minutes. Renaldas Seibutis 6-5, SG, Olympiakos 1985 Lithuania Undrafted One of the most productive players in Europe in his age group considering the level he plays at. Important cog on an excellent team, but lacks athleticism and isn\u0092t as good of a shooter as you would hope at this point in his career. Saer Sene, 7-0, Center, Pepinster 1986? Senegal First round pick? Freakishly long and athletic African prospect who played extremely well at the Nike Hoop Summit. Many question his age and lack of productivity in the very average Belgian league A player teams will want to look at closely. Sidiki Sidibe, 7-1, Center, Levallois 1985 France ??? 7-1, 265 pound volleyball player and former Kansas State commit will be in this year\u0092s draft according to his American agent. Too raw to get any playing time whatsoever in French 2nd division. Tiago Splitter, 7-0, PF/C, Tau Vitoria 1985 Brazil Lottery pick Splitter\u0092s American agent Herb Rudoy told DraftExpress exclusively he\u0092s entering the draft Splitter is having a terrific season in both the ACB Spanish League and the Euroleague, but lack of buyout in his contract means he might not be able to stay in. CBA rules allow him to withdraw and become automatically eligible next season. Tau Vitoria\u0092s president was quoted saying Splitter will be back in Spain next season. Sun Yue, 6-9, PG/SF, Aoshen 1985 China Second round pick? Super talented tall point guard with decent athleticism and nice defensive skills. Lacks strength and outside shooting ability.",
      "He'll be represented by the American agency Entersport in the United States. A midseason injury set him back from being the top Israeli player in the league despite his youth. Rudy Fern\u00e1ndez, 6-5, SG, DKV Joventut 1985 Spain First round pick? Has some minor buyout issues to deal with to make sure he can stay in the draft. Excellent season in Spain has him projected as a pretty solid first round pick. Improved outside shooting, and still the same excellent athlete, passer, defender and all-around player he\u0092s always been. Still very skinny too. Kyrylo Fesenko, 6-11, PF, Azovmash 1986 Ukraine Second Round Pick More to come. Rafael Hettsheimeir, 6-9, Center, Akasvayu Girona 1986 Brazil Undrafted Undersized Brazilian center did not overly impress at the Nike Hoop Summit, showing that he will likely lack mobility until he takes off some weight. Marko Lekic, 6-11, PF, Atlas 1985 Serbia & Montenegro ??? American agent Marc Cornstein, Lekic told us he\u0092ll be putting his name in the draft this year once again. Still a bit of an unknown, numbers are fairly average in the Serbian YUBA league. Damir Markota, 6-11, SF/PF, Cibona Zagreb 1985 Croatia Second round pick American agent Marc Cornstein told us Markota will definitely be putting his name in the draft once again. He had a breakout season in the Euroleague and Adriatic league before a groin injury slowed him down and eventually forced him to have minor surgery. Likely won\u0092t be able to come to the States until very late in the process. Does not have a buyout. Mickael Mokongo, 5-11, PG, Chalon 1986 France ??? DraftExpress was exclusively informed he\u0092ll be in the draft. Considered a talented athlete, but lack of size and the fact that he missed a large chunk of the season due to injury means his draft stock is very much up in the air still. Brad Newley, 6-6, SG, 1985 Australia Second round pick Newely has told the Australian media that he\u0092s entering the draft. Hired Philadelphia based agent Leon Rose. Scouts who saw him play in Argentina last summer like his athleticism.",
      "Desperately lacking exposure, but agent appears to be unwilling to provide him with it. Oleksiy Pecherov, 6-11, PF, Racing Basket 1985 Ukraine Second round pick DraftExpress received indication that Pecherov will be entering his name in the draft after a nice 2nd half regular season in France. Pecherov has his draft card in hand one year before he becomes automatically eligible, meaning he has nothing to lose. Has some nice skills facing the basket, but is still very soft and underdeveloped. Hrvoje Peric, 6-8, SF, KK Split 1985 Croatia Second round pick? Good athlete who is still coming into his own as a basketball player. Did not play in the Adriatic League this season. Definitely needs at least another year in Europe, but could use the exposure that declaring for the draft provides. Kosta Perovic, 7-2, Center, Partizan 1985 Serbia & Montenegro Undrafted? DraftExpress has been told that Partizan needs Perovic to be drafted this year to relieve them of his 500,000$ salary next year as well as help them financially with buyout money for their budget. Unfortunately this is happening about 3 years too late as we\u0092ve seen little to no improvement from Perovic over that span. Georgios Printezis, 6-9, PF, Olympiakos 1985 Greece Undrafted Greek power forward played 9 minutes and scored 4 points per game playing for a Euroleague team, and is declaring in hopes of getting his name out before he becomes automatically eligible next year. Milovan Rakovic, 6-10, PF, Atlas 1985 Serbia & Montenegro ??? American agent Marc Cornstein told us Rakovic will be putting his name in the draft.

Add in the fact that yields increase geometrically - you can fit a lot more 14nm chips on a given wafer size vs 22nm (or 32nm for the other manufacturers.) and you have a very appealing proposition. And then add in the fact that Intel actually has a pretty good graphics stack and IP.

You haven't been working in it long enough to seem to know that it was Acorn and Apple that invented the mobile ARM CPU in the first place. All those companies you've mentioned have just been working off Acorn and Apple's pioneering work. Now, Apple is back at it again, very successfully, and all the companies you mentioned that produce chips with ARM IP in them are licensing them from the company Acorn and Apple formed\u2014ARM.

How can you support the idea that this trend will be reversed with no real justification? I'm sure mobile chips will continue to specialize, but I don't think this means what you think it means. Automobile companies started making their own engines and with rare exceptions, never went back to being more horizontal. Same with retail and their store brands.

The reason desktop/laptop sales are stagnating/decreasing is due to the fact that most people already have one and therefore don't need to buy another one. The exact same thing will happen with tablets as well. Sales are increasing now because people without tablets are buying them. When most people already own a tablet, they won't be buying a new one every year and therefore sales will stagnate/decrease. The PC market is saturated and in a couple of years, the tablet market will be saturated too.

One of the reasons could be that Intel works with much higher margins than many of the commodity companies like Samsung and TSMC.Outside of the P4 flop and some of the monopolistic abuses, Intel has typically been selling to high end customers that are willing to pay a premium for \"the best\".",

I'm not sure the tablet market will saturate in a \"couple of years.\" It may be more like 5 years. But that's a quibble. Here's the real issue. Right now Apple wants you to own an iPhone AND iPad AND Macbook AND iWatch AND Apple TV. Microsoft, OTOH, is making the Surface so that you could ditch your laptop and just use a Surface. Not everyone, but some people. If 5 years from now, we're in a world where a significant number of people use a Surface-type device instead of a laptop, then the PC market is going to contract significantly. Maybe some of the tablet-like devices will use moderately expensive Intel chips, but some of them are going to use cheaper chips.

As mentioned in the article, TSV's (Through Silicon Via's) are going to be quite a disruption. Today, people normally stack an LPDDR2 package on top of their SOC package (POP or Package On Package). Within the LPDDR2 package, you could have a stack of DRAM die typically with wire bonding connecting the die within the package. Once you more to TSV's, you can have a LOT more connections between the SOC and its DRAM's. While this is being standardized through JEDEC (http://www.jedec.org/category/technolog ... a/3d-ics-0), Samsung has all the pieces in house to do whatever they want. You could see a 512 bit or higher bus from the SOC to the memory. The trick is that the memory and the SOC need to line up with each other when you stack them."

      "To understand this, we analyze the strain matrix $M_s \\left(\\sigma,\\theta\\right)$ and find that in the case of small strains studied here, there is an approximate relationship between the bond lengths under these two strains, given by \\[{r \\left( \\sigma, \\theta \\right)} - {r \\left( -\\sigma, \\theta + 90^\\circ\\right)} \\simeq \\sigma \\left( {1 - \\gamma } \\right) r_0,\\] which is $\\theta$-independent for all \\emph{C-C} bond vectors. It implies that there is a fixed ratio between the hopping energies $t_i \\left( \\sigma, \\theta \\right)$ and $t_i \\left( -\\sigma, \\theta + 90^\\circ\\right)$ and hence there is the similar shift of Dirac points in these two cases. \\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.4in]{Fig06.pdf}\n\\caption{Map showing the dependence of conduction gap on the directions ($\\theta,\\phi$) for $\\sigma = 4 \\%$.

The strains $\\sigma_c = -2 \\%$ and $\\sigma_t = 2 \\%$ are applied in (a,c) while $\\sigma_c = -1 \\%$ and $\\sigma_t = 3 \\%$ in (b,d).}\n\\label{fig_sim4}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nWe now go to analyze the properties of conduction gap shown in Figs. 5(c,d) where the transport is along the zigzag direction $\\phi = 30^\\circ$. In fact, the conduction gap in this case can reach a value as high as that of the case of $\\phi = 0$ but has different $\\theta$-dependence. In particular, the conduction gap has peaks at $\\theta \\approx 47^\\circ$ and $133^\\circ$ for tensile strain and at $\\theta \\approx 43^\\circ$ and $137^\\circ$ for compressive strain, where it is zero in the case of $\\phi = 0$. It is also equal to zero at $\\theta = 0$ and $\\theta = 90^\\circ$ where the peaks of conduction gap occur in the latter case of $\\phi = 0$.",
      "We remind as displayed in Fig. 2(a) that a finite bandgap opens only for strain larger than $\\sim 23 \\%$ and the zigzag (not armchair) is the preferred direction for bandgap opening under a tensile strain \\cite{per209}. We extend our investigation to the case of compressive strain and find  (see in Fig. 2(b) ) that (i) the same gap threshold of $\\sigma \\simeq 23 \\%$ is observed but (ii) the preferred direction to open the gap under a compressive strain is the armchair, not the zigzag as the case of tensile strain. This implies that the properties of graphene bandstructure at low energy should be qualitatively the same when applying strains of $\\left\\{ {\\sigma ,\\theta } \\right\\}$ and of $\\left\\{ {-\\sigma ,\\theta + 90^\\circ} \\right\\}$. This feature can be understood by considering, for example, strains of $\\left\\{ {\\sigma , \\theta = 0} \\right\\}$ and of $\\left\\{ {-\\sigma , \\theta = 90^\\circ} \\right\\}$. Indeed, these strains result in the same qualitative changes on the bond-lengths, i.e., an increased bond-length $r_3$ and reduced bond-lengths $r_{1,2}$. However, for the same strain strength, because of the exponential dependence of hoping energies on the bond-lengths, the compressive strain generally induces a larger bandgap than the tensile one, as can be seen when comparing the data displayed in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). To conclude, we would like to emphasize that a large strain is necessary to open a bandgap in graphene. This could be an issue for practical applications, compared to the use of graphene strained junctions explored in \\cite{hung14}. We now go to explore the properties of conduction gap in the graphene strained junctions. In Fig. 3, we display the conductance as a function of energy computed from Eq. (5) using the Green's function technique. As discussed above, a small strain of a few percent (e.g., 4 $\\%$ here) can not change the gapless character of graphene, i.e., there is no gap of conductance in the case of uniformly strained graphene. However, similar to that reported in \\cite{hung14}, a significant conduction-gap of a few hundreds meV can open in the unstrained/strained graphene junctions.",
      "In particular, the relationship for conduction gap peaks is approximately given by $\\theta = \\theta_A - \\eta_s \\phi$. For tensile strains, $\\eta_s$ takes the values of $\\sim 1.5667$ and $1.4333$ for $\\theta_A = 0$ and $90^\\circ$, respectively. On the opposite, it is about $1.4333$ and $1.5667$ for $\\theta_A = 0$ and $90^\\circ$, respectively, for compressive strain cases. All these features are consequences of the rotation of Dirac points in the $k$-space with respect to the transport direction $\\phi$ as illustrated in the diagram on the top and the lattice symmetry of graphene. Finally, we investigate other junctions based on compressive and tensile strained graphene sections. The idea is that in this type of strained junction, the shifts of Dirac points are different in two graphene sections of different strains, which offers the possibilities to use smaller strains to achieve a similar conduction gap, compared to the case of unstrained/strained junction. In Fig. 7, we display the maps of conduction gap with respect to the directions of compressive ($\\theta_c$) and tensile ($\\theta_t$) strains in two cases of transport direction $\\phi = 0$ (armchair) and $30^\\circ$ (zigzag) for given strain strengths. Indeed, as seen in Fig. 7(a,b), with smaller strains $\\left\\{ {{\\sigma _c},{\\sigma _t}} \\right\\} = \\left\\{ { - 2\\% ,2\\% } \\right\\}$ or $\\left\\{ { - 1\\% ,3\\% } \\right\\}$, similar conduction gap of about 310 meV can be achieved (see Figs. 7(a,b)) while it requires a strain of 4 $\\%$ in the unstrained/strained junctions discussed above. However, since the shift of Dirac points is strongly dependent on the direction of applied strains and the transport direction, the properties of conduction gap are more complicated than in the latter case. In particular, our calculations show that the preferred transport directions to achieve a large conduction gap are close to the armchair one. Otherwise, the conduction gap is generally smaller, similarly to the data for $\\phi = 30^\\circ$ compared to $\\phi = 0$, as shown in Fig.",
      "Hence, the data obtained for $\\phi$ ranging from $-30^\\circ$ to $30^\\circ$ and $\\theta  \\in \\left[ {0^\\circ ,180^\\circ } \\right]$ covers the properties of conduction gap in all possible cases. In Fig. 5, we present the maps of conduction gap with respect to the strain and its applied direction in two particular cases: the transport is either along the armchair ($\\phi = 0$) or the zigzag ($\\phi = 30^\\circ$) directions. Both tensile and compressive strains are considered. Let us first discuss the results obtained in the armchair case. Figs. 5(a,b) show that (i) a large conduction gap up to about 500 meV can open with a strain of 6 $\\%$ and (ii) again the conduction gap is strongly $\\theta$-dependent, in particular, its peaks occur at $\\theta = 0$ or $90^\\circ$ while the gap is zero at $\\theta \\approx 47^\\circ$ and $133^\\circ$ for tensile strain and at $\\theta \\approx 43^\\circ$ and $137^\\circ$ for compressive strain. In principle, the conduction gap is larger if the shift of Dirac points in the $\\kappa_y$-axis is larger, as discussed above about Figs. 3-4. We notice that the strain-induced shifts can be different for the six Dirac points of graphene \\cite{kitt12} and the gap is zero when there is any Dirac point observed at the same $\\kappa_y$ in the two graphene sections. From Eq. (9), we find that the Dirac points are determined by the following equations:\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n  {\\cos}\\frac{\\kappa_y}{2} & =& \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{{t_3^2 - {{\\left( {{t_1} - {t_2}} \\right)}^2}}}{{{t_1}{t_2}}}}, \\\\\n  \\cos \\frac{{\\kappa_x}}{2} &=& \\frac{{{t_1} + {t_2}}}{{\\left| {{t_3}} \\right|}}\\cos \\frac{{\\kappa_y}}{2},\\,\\,\\,\\sin \\frac{{\\kappa_x}}{2} = \\frac{{{t_2} - {t_1}}}{{\\left| {{t_3}} \\right|}}\\sin \\frac{{\\kappa_y}}{2},\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nwhich simplify into ${\\cos}\\frac{\\kappa_y}{2} = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$ and, respectively, $\\cos \\left( {\\frac{{{\\kappa _x}}}{2}} \\right) = \\mp 1$ in the unstrained case. Hence, the zero conduction gap is obtained if\n\\begin{equation*}\n  \\frac{{t_3^2 - {{\\left( {{t_1} - {t_2}} \\right)}^2}}}{{4{t_1}{t_2}}} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\end{equation*}\nAdditionally, it is observed that the effects of a strain $\\{\\sigma,\\theta\\}$ are qualitatively similar to those of a strain $\\{-\\sigma,\\theta+90^\\circ\\}$, i.e., the peaks and zero values of conduction gap are obtained at the same $\\theta$ in these two situations.",
      "The relationship between these two transport directions can be explained as follows. On the one hand, based on the analyses above for $\\phi = 0$, we find that for a given strength of strain, a maximum shift of Dirac points along the $k_y$-axis corresponds to a minimum along the $k_x$-one and vice versa when varying the strain direction $\\theta$. On the other hand, as schematized in the top of Fig. 6 below, the change in the transport direction results in the rotation of the first Brillouin zone, i.e., the $k_x$ (resp. $k_y$) axis in the case of $\\phi = 30^\\circ$ is identical to the $k_y$ (resp. $k_x$) axis in the case of $\\phi = 0$. These two features explain essentially the opposite $\\theta$-dependence of conduction gap for $\\phi = 30^\\circ$, compared to the case of $\\phi = 0$ as mentioned. Again, we found the same qualitative behavior of conduction gap when applying the strains of $\\{\\sigma,\\theta\\}$ and $\\{-\\sigma,\\theta+90^\\circ\\}$. Next, we investigate the conduction gap with respect to different transport directions $\\phi$. We display a ($\\theta,\\phi$)-map of conduction gap for $\\sigma = 4 \\%$ in Fig. 6 and, in the top, an additional diagram illustrating the rotation of Dirac points in the $k-$space with the change in the transport direction. It is clearly shown that (i) a similar scale of conduction gap is obtained for all different transport directions, (ii) there is a smooth and continuous shift of $E_{cond.gap}-\\theta$ behavior when varying $\\phi$, and (iii) the same behavior of $E_{cond.gap}$ is also observed when comparing the two transport directions of $\\phi$ and $\\phi+30^\\circ$, similarly to the comparison above between $\\phi = 0^\\circ$ and $30^\\circ$. The data plotted in Fig. 6 additionally shows that $E_{cond.gap}$ takes the same value in both cases of $\\{\\phi,\\theta\\}$ and $\\{-\\phi,-\\theta\\}$ with a remark that the strains of $-\\theta$ and $180^\\circ-\\theta$ are identical. Moreover, the values of $\\theta$ and $\\phi$, for which the conduction gap has a peak or is equal to zero, have an almost linear relationship."

      "The scalarization parameters \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 and \u03b3 3 in the objective function account for a relative tradeoff between maximizing speed, minimizing lane changes and minimizing abrupt changes in speed respectively. Increasing \u03b3 1 yields a more aggressive behavior with the priority placed on maximizing speed while \u03b3 2 and \u03b3 3 combine to place an emphasis on maximizing passenger comfort by reducing lane and speed changes respectively. Dynamical Constraints: These constraints are put in place to ensure the dynamical feasibility of the solution. The constraints ( ), and serve to initialize the longitudinal displacement, speed and target lane respectively for the optimizer, based on the values observed at time instant k. The constraints and ( ) bound the ego vehicle's speed by the speed limit and the acceleration limits of the vehicle respectively. The ego vehicle's speed is then used to calculate the projected longitudinal displacement in . The target lane values at any planning step (j) are restricted to the set of reachable values by ( ), ( ) and . Here, restricts the target lane to the set of available lanes (L(k)), ensures that the lane change, if needed, is made to the adjacent lane only and (17) models the time steps (N ) required for a lane change. The flooring function can easily be transformed into a couple of linear constraints by the introduction of an auxiliary integer variable, as shown in the Appendix. Finally, l k (j) is merely the internal representation of the lane the ego vehicle is projected to travel on at planning step j. Safety Constraint: The safety constraint ensures that the ego vehicle maintains a minimum safe distance (L s i (j)) to the nearest vehicle i, in its projected lane of travel (l k (j)), at planning instant j.\nWe borrow the definition of this safe distance from , where the authors provide a formalization, based on the clause from Vienna Convention on Road Traffic that states that \"A vehicle [...] shall keep at a sufficient distance [...] to avoid collision if the vehicle in front should suddenly slow down or stop.",
      "Based on the estimated parameters, we predict the future speed and longitudinal displacement as follows: Here, H a corresponds to the acceleration horizon while vk i (j) and \u015dk i (j) respectively represent the predicted speed and longitudinal displacement for vehicle i, j time steps into the future starting from the current time instant k. Remark 2: Due to the modular nature of the proposed framework, the behavior planning module detailed in Section III-B can work with advanced maneuver-based (e.g.\nMarkov Chain ) and interaction-based (e.g. Social Generative Adversarial Networks ) trajectory prediction modules, allowing for interactive maneuvering behaviors. Speed and Lane Advisory System\n\nThe goal of our behavior planning module, Speed and Lane Advisory System or in short, SLAS, is to determine a sequence of speed and lane change commands that would enable the ego vehicle to maximize its speed, thus minimizing the travel time, while accounting for driver comfort and abiding by its dynamical, actuator, and safety limits. The output of this module is a relatively smooth speed and lane change profile which is then passed on to a motion planner. It is necessary to incorporate the dynamical and actuator limits in the behavioral planning module so as not to provide the motion planner with goals that are not reachable, and jeopardize the safety of the overall system as a result. In the subsequent discussion, we provide a formulation of the optimization problem for SLAS; highlight the modifications necessary to improve the computational complexity; and, present safety and feasibility analysis. 1) Optimization Problem with Integer Constraints: SLAS is posed as an optimization problem, with the objective to maximize speed while minimizing frequent lane changes and abrupt changes in speed. The output of SLAS, at time instant k, is the control input u 0 (k + 1), as defined in . The optimization problem is formulated as follows: Objective Function: In the formulation above, the optimization variables are the ego vehicle's speed (v k (j)) and target lane (L k (j)), j step into the future, starting from time instant k.\nHere, H corresponds to the planning horizon.",
      "We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in contrast to the existing methods, when applied in conjunction with state-of-the-art trajectory generation and trajectory following frameworks, in a CARLA simulation environment. INTRODUCTION\n\nLane changing is considered to be one of the most risky driving behaviors since it is highly contingent upon multimodal trajectory predictions of neighboring vehicles and requires timely decision making . It is further influenced by a number of uncertainty factors such as road conditions, measurement accuracy, and a long tail of behavioral uncertainty of on-road agents. However, if executed efficiently, lane changing coupled with speed adjustment can yield significant improvement in minimizing overall travel time while ensuring passenger comfort . To elaborate further, consider the scenario presented in Fig. . Based on the predicted motion (shown in a lighter shade) of the neighboring vehicles (shown in orange), the ego vehicle (shown in blue) may decide to either change lane left in an attempt to minimize its travel time or slow down in the current lane to maintain safety. However, it would be imprudent for the ego vehicle to risk changing lane right and consequently get stuck behind a slow moving vehicle even though there is presently a greater headway. This simple scenario highlights the importance of foresight and long planning-horizon in strategic decision making for autonomous vehicles. Existing methods like MOBIL give us the ability to change lanes but behave greedily (prioritizing immediate rewards) oftentimes, which can lead to sub-optimal performance. It was shown in that the lane changing performance can be improved with an A inspired approach, but the formulation was limited to constant speed. Such an approach is unable to assess the benefits of speed adjustment 1 University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA. Email: {mftariq,baras}@umd.edu. 2 Honda Research Institute, San Jose, CA, USA.

      "Throughout the manuscript, Z will denote the set of integers and R the set of real numbers. For some a, c \u2208 Z and a < c, we will write For some e, g \u2208 R and e < g, we will write\n\nRoad Model\n\nThe physical road structure is modeled as a continuous multi-lane highway with negligible curvature and unidirectional traffic flow. The lanes on the highway are clearly demarcated and at any given time k, the number of available lanes for the vehicles to travel on is denoted by N l (k) while the road speed limit is denoted by V l . Therefore, the set of lanes available for traveling at a given time instant k is denoted by . We work with the Frenet coordinate system where the distance along the road is denoted by the longitudinal displacement (s) and the distance perpendicular to the road is defined by the lateral displacement (d). Each lane is assigned a lane indicator variable l. The leftmost lane, with respect to the direction of traffic flow, is assigned a value of l = 0 while each subsequent lane is assigned an increasing integer value for l, as depicted in Fig. . Vehicle Model\n\nSince we aim to have real-time computations for a long planning horizon (> 15s), we model the vehicle dynamics with a linearized decoupled dynamical system. For the highway driving scenario, where the road curvature is typically small, it is reasonable to assume a decoupling between the lateral and the longitudinal dynamics , especially for the behavior planning layer. Therefore, we utilize a linear constant acceleration model for the longitudinal dynamics and abstract out the lateral dynamics with a lane indicator variable. For the lane change dynamics, we use a moving average filter coupled with a rounding function to model the time required by the ego vehicle to change lanes. This is compactly represented as: where s 0 (k), v 0 (k), l 0 (k) and L(k) denote the ego vehicle's longitudinal displacement, speed, lane indicator and target lane, respectively, at time instant k; the subscript i indexes the vehicles on the road with 0 being reserved for the ego vehicle; T s denotes the discretization time step; and N corresponds to the number of time steps required to change lane.",
      "The augmented minimum safety distance ( Ls i (j)) incorporates the time required to execute the lane change maneuver (N ) from ( ) into the following unified safety constraint: where L l is the width of the lanes (see Fig. ), \u03b4(k) is the signed lateral deviation of the ego vehicle from the previous target lane's boundary at time step k, and \u03b3 d (\u03b4 k (j)) is the dynamic cost of deviation from the previous target lane (L(k \u2212 1)). Moreover, in the cost function , we take L k (0) = L(k \u2212 1). These costs are introduced to prevent the swerving (canceling of lane switch before completion) behavior, unless absolutely necessary (for safety purposes). Remark 4: Since the ego vehicle is considered to have changed lane once it crosses a lane boundary, the deviation \u03b4 k (j) is considered from the lane boundary instead of the center of the target lane to maintain the continuity of \u03b3 d (\u03b4 k (j)) with respect to the lateral displacement of the ego vehicle. Specifically, \u03b4 k (j) > 0 if the ego vehicle has crossed the previous target lane boundary and 0 otherwise. This is an important consideration since a discontinuity in \u03b3 d (\u03b4 k (j)), upon completion of lane change, may lead to infeasibility. Remark 5: The swerving behavior is suppressed but not completely eliminated with a hard constraint since such a behavior is necessary at times to react to the environment's unpredictability. This reactive strategy, which is a distinctive feature of our approach, avails the algorithm the ability to proactively 'change its mind' in case something unanticipated happens in the environment that can jeopardize safety. Optimization Warm Start: To aid the optimizer in finding an initially feasible solution, we provide the solution from the previous time step as a reference. Formally, This doesn't imply that the solution from time step k \u2212 1 will hold exactly at time step k, owing to the unmodeled disturbances, but providing this reference aids the optimizer in finding an initially feasible solution in the vicinity of the reference solution."

      "The parameter k can then be chosen by cross-validation as above. We employ this approach under scenario (A) instead of an unavailable fully data-driven criterion and name it semi-oracle. Finally, for all three scenarios (A), (B) and (C), the oracle tapering parameter is computed using grid search for each Monte Carlo sample as kor = arg min k=2,3,...,p/2 T ap k ( \u03a3) \u2212 \u03a3 , where \u03a3 is the sample covariance matrix. To speed up the computation, one can replace the spectral norm by the 1 norm, as suggested by . In Tables , the errors of the Toeplitz covariance estimators with respect to the spectral norm and the computation time for one Monte Carlo iteration are given for scenarios (A), (B) and (C), respectively. To illustrate the goodness-of-fit of the spectral density, the L 2 norm f \u2212 f 2 is also computed. The results show that the tapering and VST-DCT estimator perform overall similar in terms of the spectral norm risk. This is not surprising as both estimators are proved to be rate-optimal. Moreover, both the tapering and VST-DCT estimators are clearly superior to the inconsistent sample Toeplitz covariance matrix. A closer look at the numbers shows that the VST-DCT method has better constants, i.e., VST-DCT estimators have somewhat smaller errors in the spectral norm than the tapering estimators across all examples, but especially under scenario (C). The oracle estimators show similar behaviour, but are slightly less variable compared to the data-driven estimators. In general, both the tapering and VST-DCT estimators perform best for example 1, second best for example 3 and worst for example 2, which traces back to functions complexity. In terms of computational time, both methods are similarly fast for scenarios (A) and (B). For scenario (C), the tapering method is much slower due to the multiple high-dimensional matrix multiplications in the cross-validation method. It is expected that for larger p the tapering estimator is much more computationally intensive than the corresponding VST-DCT estimator.",

This estimator is based on a data transformation that translates the problem of Toeplitz covariance matrix estimation to the problem of mean estimation in an approximate Gaussian regression. The resulting Toeplitz covariance matrix estimator is positive definite by construction, fully data-driven and computationally very fast. Moreover, this estimator is shown to be minimax optimal under the spectral norm for a large class of Toeplitz matrices. These results are readily extended to estimation of inverses of Toeplitz covariance matrices. Also, an alternative version of the Whittle likelihood for the spectral density based on the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is proposed. The method is implemented in the R package vstdct that accompanies the paper. Introduction\n\nEstimation of covariance and precision matrices is a fundamental problem in statistical data analysis with countless applications in the natural and social sciences. Covariance matrices with a Toeplitz structure arise in the study of stationary stochastic n = 1, to the best of our knowledge, there is no fully data-driven approach for selecting the banding/tapering/thresholding parameter.\nsuggested first to split the time series into non-overlapping subseries and then apply the cross-validation criterion of .",
      "However, it turns out that the right choice of the subseries length is crucial for this approach, but there is no data-based method available for this. In this work, an alternative way to estimate a Toeplitz covariance matrix and its inverse is chosen. Our approach exploits the one-to-one correspondence between Toeplitz covariance matrices and their spectral densities. First, the given data are transformed into approximate Gaussian random variables whose mean equals to the logarithm of the spectral density. Then, the log-spectral density is estimated by a periodic smoothing spline with a data-driven smoothing parameter. Finally, the resulting spectral density estimator is transformed into an estimator for \u03a3 or its inverse. It is shown that this procedure leads to an estimator that is fully data-driven, automatically positive definite and achieves the minimax optimal convergence rate under the spectral norm over a large class of Toeplitz covariance matrices. In particular, this class includes Toeplitz covariance matrices that correspond to long-memory processes with bounded spectral densities. Moreover, the computation is very efficient, does not require iterative or resampling schemes and allows to apply any inference and adaptive estimation procedures developed in the context of nonparametric Gaussian regression. Estimation of the spectral density from a stationary time series is a research topic with a long history. Earlier nonparametric methods are based on smoothing of the (log-)periodogram, which itself is not a consistent estimator . Another line of nonparametric methods for estimating the spectral density is based on the Whittle likelihood, which is an ap-proximation to the exact likelihood of the time series in the frequency domain. For example, estimated the spectral density from a penalized Whittle likelihood, while used polynomial splines to estimate the log-spectral density function maximizing the Whittle likelihood. Recently, Bayesian methods for spectral density estimation have been proposed (see , but these may become very computationally intensive in large samples due to posterior sampling.",
      "Therefore, we suggest an alternative approach that allows the spectral density to be estimated as a mean in an approximate Gaussian regression. Such estimators have a closed-form expression, do not require an iterative optimization algorithm and a smoothing parameter can be easily obtained with any conventional criterion. First Hence, for W j = (D t j Y ) 2 , j = 1, . . . , p it follows with Lemma 1 that where \u0393(a, b) denotes a gamma distribution with a shape parameter a and a scale parameter b. Note that the random variables W 1 , . . . , W p are only asymptotically independent. Obviously, E(W j ) = f (\u03c0x j ) + O(1), j = 1, . . .\n, p. To estimate f from W 1 , . . . , W p , one could use a generalized nonparametric regression framework with a gamma distributed response, see e.g., the classical monograph by . However, this approach requires an iterative procedure for estimation, e.g., a Newton-Raphson algorithm, with a suitable choice for the smoothing parameter at each iteration step. Deriving the L \u221e rate for the resulting estimator is also not a trivial task. Instead, we suggest to employ a variance stabilizing transform of that converts the gamma regression into an approximate Gaussian regression. In the next section we present the methodology in more detail for a general setting with n \u2265 1. Methodology\n\nFor Y i \u223c N p (0 p , \u03a3), i = 1, . . . , n, it was shown in the previous section that with Lemma 1 the data can be transformed into gamma distributed random variables . . , n, j = 1, . . . , p, where for each fixed i the random variable W i,j has the same distribution as W j given in (3). Now the approach of Cai et al. ( ) is adapted to the setting n \u2265 1. First, the transformed data points W i,j are binned, that is, fewer new variables . . , T . Note that the number of observations in a bin is m = np/T . In Theorem 1 in Section 4, we show that setting T = p \u03c5 for any \u03c5 \u2208 ((4 \u2212 2 min{\u03b2, 1})/3, 1) leads to the minimax optimal rate for the spectral density estimator. To simplify the notation, m is handled as an integer (otherwise, one can discard several observations in the last bin).",
      "Therefore, an accurate estimator of this quantity is crucial for the interpretation of the results and can only be achieved if the dependence in the data is taken into account. Estimating \u03a3 with a tapered covariance estimator has two practical problems. First, since we only have a single realization of a time series Y (n = 1), there is no datadriven method for selecting the tapering parameter. Second, the tapering estimator turned out not to be positive definite for the data at hand. To solve the second problem, we truncated the corresponding spectral density estimator ftap to a small positive value, i.e., f + tap = max{ ftap , 1/ log(p)} (see . To select the tapering parameter with cross-validation, we experimented with different subseries lengths and found that the tapering estimator is very sensitive to this choice. For example, estimating the tapered covariance matrix based on subseries of length 8/15/30 yields a correlation of 0.42/0.53/0.34 between the true diameter and the first PLS component, respectively. Altogether, our proposed estimator is fully data-driven, fast even for large sample sizes, automatically positive definite and can handle certain long-memory processes. In contrast, the tapering estimator is not data-driven and must be manipulated to become positive definite. Our method is implemented in the R package vstdct. Discussion\n\nIn this paper, we proposed a simple, fast, fully data-driven, automatically positive definite and minimax optimal estimator of Toeplitz covariance matrices from a large class that also includes covariance matrices of certain long-memory processes. Our estimator is derived under the assumption that the data are Gaussian. However, simulations show that the suggested approach yields robust estimators even when the data are not normally distributed. In the context of spectral density estima- , for mixing processes (see Theorem 5.3 of Rosenblatt, 2012), as well as for non-linear processes (see . Since DFT and DCT matrices are closely related, we expect that equation (3) also holds asymptotically for these non-Gaussian time series, but consider a rigorous analysis to be beyond the scope of this paper."

Fig. 3 | Characterization of closed-shell indeno[1,2-a]fluorene on bilayer NaCl/Au(111).a, DFTcalculated wave functions of the frontier orbitals of closed-shell 5 0 (isovalue: 0.002 e -\u00c5 -3 ) .The wave functions shown here are calculated for the 5para geometry.b, DFT-calculated bond lengths of 5ortho (top) and 5para (bottom).c, Constant-height I(V) spectra acquired on a species of 5 assigned as 5para, along with the corresponding dI/dV(V) spectra.

      "The AFM image of assigned 5para shown in Fig. indicates higher bond orders of the bonds b, d and f compared to a, c and e, respectively. In addition, the bond g appears almost point-like and with enhanced \u0394f contrast compared to its neighboring bonds, indicative of a high bond order (see Supplementary Fig. for height-dependent measurements). These observations concur with the calculated 5para geometry (Fig. ). Importantly, all these distinguishing bond-order differences are distinctly different in the AFM image of 5OS shown in Fig. , which is consistent with the calculated 5OS geometry (Fig. ). In the AFM images of 5OS (Fig. and Supplementary Fig. ), the bonds a-d at the pentagon apices appear with similar contrast and apparent bond length. The bonds e and f at one of the terminal benzenoid rings also exhibit similar contrast and apparent bond length, while the central bond g appears longer compared to assigned 5para. Further compelling evidence for the closed-shell state of assigned 5para is obtained by STM and STS. dI/dV(V) spectra acquired on an assigned 5para species exhibit two peaks centered at -1.4 V (PIR) and 1.6 V (NIR) (Fig. ). STM images acquired at these biases (Fig. ) show the orbital densities of \u03b2 (-1.4 V) and \u03b1 (1.6 V). First, the observation of \u03b1 and \u03b2 as the frontier orbitals of this species, and not the SOMOs, strongly indicates its closed-shell state. Second, consistent with AFM measurements that indicate good correspondence to the calculated 5para geometry, we observe \u03b2 as the HOMO and \u03b1 as the LUMO. For 5ortho, \u03b1 should be observed as the HOMO and \u03b2 as the LUMO. We did not observe molecules with the signatures of 5ortho in our experiments. We observed molecules in open-(5OS, Fig. ) and closed-shell (5para, Fig. ) states in similar occurrence after their generation from 6 on the surface. We could also switch individual molecules between open-and closed-shell states as shown in Fig. and Supplementary Fig. . To this end, a change in the adsorption site of a molecule was induced by STM imaging at ionic resonances, which often resulted in movement of the molecule.",
      "Increasing the bias to the peak of the PIR at -1.5 V, it becomes possible to also empty the SOMO \u03c82, such that the corresponding STM image shows the superposition of \u03c81 and \u03c82, that is, |\u03c81| 2 + |\u03c82| 2 (ref.\n). Similarly, the NIR corresponds to transitions between 5 0 and 5 -1 . At the NIR onset of 1.3 V, only electron attachment to \u03c82 is energetically possible. At 1.6 V, electron attachment to \u03c81 also becomes possible, and the corresponding STM image shows the superposition of \u03c81 and \u03c82. The observation of the orbital densities of SOMOs, and not the hybridized HOMO and LUMO, proves the open-shell ground state of assigned 5OS. Measurements of the monoradical species with a doublet ground state are shown in Supplementary Fig. . Unexpectedly, another species of 5 was also experimentally observed that exhibited a closedshell ground state. In contrast to 5OS, where the frontier orbitals correspond to the SOMOs \u03c81 and \u03c82, DFT calculations predict orbitals of different shapes and symmetries for 5para and 5ortho, denoted as \u03b1 and \u03b2 and shown in Fig. . For 5ortho, \u03b1 and \u03b2 correspond to HOMO and LUMO, respectively. The orbitals are inverted in energy and occupation for 5para, where \u03b2 is the HOMO and \u03b1 is the LUMO. Fig. shows an AFM image of 5 that we assign as 5para. We experimentally infer its closed-shell state first by using qualitative bond order discrimination by AFM. In high-resolution AFM imaging, chemical bonds with higher bond order are imaged brighter (that is, with higher frequency shift \u0394f) due to stronger repulsive forces, and they appear shorter . In Fig. , we label seven bonds whose bond orders show significant qualitative differences in the calculated 5ortho, 5para (Fig. ) and 5OS (Fig. ) geometries. In 5para, the bonds b and d exhibit a higher bond order than a and c, respectively. This pattern is reversed for 5ortho, while the bond orders of the bonds a-d are all similar and small for 5OS. Furthermore, in 5para bond f exhibits a higher bond order than e, while in 5ortho and 5OS bonds e and f exhibit similar bond order (because they belong to Clar sextets). Finally, the bond labeled g shows a higher bond order in 5para than in 5ortho and 5OS.",
      "In the main text, we focus on the characterization of 5 on bilayer NaCl/Au(111). Characterization of charge bistable 5 is reported in Supplementary Figs. . We first describe experiments on 5 on bilayer NaCl/Au(111), where 5 exhibits a geometry corresponding to the calculated 5OS geometry, and an open-shell electronic configuration. We compare the experimental data on this species to calculations on 5OS with a triplet configuration, as theory predicts a triplet ground state for 5OS. For 5OS, the calculated frontier orbitals correspond to the SOMOs \u03c81 and \u03c82 (Fig. ), whose spin up levels are occupied and the spin down levels are empty. Figure shows the DFT-calculated bond lengths of 5OS, where the two salient features, namely, the small difference in the bond lengths within each ring and the notably longer bond lengths in the pentagonal rings, agree with the open-shell resonance structure of 5 (Fig. ). Figure shows an AFM image of 5 adsorbed on bilayer NaCl/Au(111) that we assign as 5OS, where the bond-order differences qualitatively correspond to the calculated 5OS geometry (discussed and compared to the closed-shell state below). Differential conductance spectra (dI/dV(V), where I and V denote the tunneling current and bias voltage, respectively) acquired on assigned 5OS exhibit two peaks centered at -1.5 V and 1.6 V (Fig. ), which we assign to the positive and negative ion resonances (PIR and NIR), respectively. Figure shows the corresponding STM images acquired at the onset (V = -1.2\nV/1.3 V) and the peak (V = -1.5 V/1.6 V) of the ionic resonances. To draw a correspondence between the STM images and the molecular orbital densities, we consider tunneling events as many-body electronic transitions between different charge states of 5OS (Fig. ). Within this framework, the PIR corresponds to transitions between 5 0 and the cationic state 5 . At the onset of the PIR at -1.2 V, an electron can only be detached from the SOMO \u03c81 and the corresponding STM image at -1.2 V shows the orbital density of \u03c81."

      "Multi- and one- stage detectors with three kinds of backbones (\\emph{i.e.,} ResNet18, 50, 101) give a comprehensive assessment on DUO. We also deploy all the methods to AGX to assess efficiency. In general, the multi-stage (Cascade R-CNN) detectors have high accuracy and low efficiency, while the one-stage (RetinaNet) detectors have low accuracy and high efficiency.

      "In terms of the content of the dataset images, there are a large number of similar or duplicate images in the URPC datasets. URPC2017 only retains 15\\% images after removing similar images compared to other datasets. Thus the detector trained on URPC2017 is easy to overfit and cannot reflect the real performance. For other URPC datasets, the latter also includes images from the former, \\emph{e.g.}, URPC2019 adds 2,000 new images compared to URPC2018; compared with URPC2019, URPC2020$_{ZJ}$ adds 800 new images. The URPC2020$_{DL}$ adds 1,000 new images compared to the URPC2020$_{ZJ}$. It is worth mentioning that the annotation of all datasets is incomplete; some datasets lack the starfish labels and it is easy to find error or missing labels. \\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/ZhangBHRV17} pointed out that although the CNN model has a strong fitting ability for any dataset, the existence of dirty data will significantly weaken its robustness. Therefore, a reasonable dataset (containing a small number of similar images as well as an accurate annotation) and a corresponding recognized benchmark are urgently needed to promote community development. To address these issues, we introduce a dataset called Detecting Underwater Objects (DUO) by collecting and re-annotating all the available underwater datasets. It contains 7,782 underwater images after deleting overly similar images and has a more accurate annotation with four types of classes (\\emph{i.e.,} holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish). Besides, based on the MMDetection$\\protect\\footnote{MMDetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. {\\bf https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection}}$ \\cite{chen2019mmdetection} framework, we also provide a \\emph{SOTA} detector benchmark containing efficiency and accuracy indicators, providing a reference for both academic research and industrial applications.

(b) ZFC-FC curves for in-plane and out-of-plane applied fields (0.015 T).}\n\\label{fig10}\n\\end{figure} In order to derive the magnetic size and anisotropy of the Mn-rich nanocolumns embedded in the Ge matrix, we have fitted the inverse normalized in-plane (resp. out-of-plane) susceptibility: $\\chi_{\\parallel}^{-1}$ (resp. $\\chi_{\\perp}^{-1}$). The corresponding experimental ZFC-FC curves are reported in Fig. 10b. Since susceptibility measurements are performed at low field (0.015 T), the matrix magnetic signal remains negligible. In order to normalize susceptibility data, we need to divide the magnetic moment by the saturated magnetic moment recorded at 5 T. However the matrix magnetic signal becomes very strong at 5 T and low temperature so that we need to subtract it from the saturated magnetic moment using a simple Curie function. From Fig. 10b, we can conclude that nanocolumns are isotropic. Therefore to fit experimental data we use the following expression well suited for isotropic systems or cubic anisotropy: $\\chi_{\\parallel}^{-1}= \\chi_{\\perp}^{-1}\\approx 3k_{B}T/M(T)+\\mu_{0}H_{eff}(T)$. $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $M=M_{s}v$ is the magnetic moment of a single-domain nanostructure (macrospin approximation) where $M_{s}$ is its magnetization and $v$ its volume. The in-plane magnetic field is applied along $[110]$ or $[-110]$ crystal axes. Since the nanostructures Curie temperature does not exceed 170 K, the temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization is also accounted for by writting $M(T)$. Antiferromagnetic interactions between nanostructures are also considered by adding an effective field estimated in the mean field approximation \\cite{Fruc02}: $\\mu_{0}H_{eff}(T)$.\nThe only fitting parameters are the maximum magnetic moment (\\textit{i.e.} at low temperature) per nanostructure: $M$ (in Bohr magnetons $\\mu_{B}$) and the maximum interaction field (\\textit{i.e.} at low temperature): $\\mu_{0}H_{eff}$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\center\n   \\includegraphics[width=.7\\linewidth]{./fig11.eps}\n\\caption{Temperature dependence of the inverse in-plane (open circles) and out-of-plane (open squares) normalized susceptibilities of a Ge$_{0.887}$Mn$_{0.113}$ sample grown at 115$^{\\circ}$C.

      "We rather believe that out-of-plane shape anisotropy is nearly compensated by in-plane magnetoelastic anisotropy due to compression leading to a \\textit{pseudo} cubic anisotropy. From the blocking temperature (15 K) and the magnetic volume of the nanostructures , we can derive their magnetic anisotropy constant using $Kv=25k_{B}T_{B}$: K$\\approx$10 kJ.m$^{-3}$ which is of the same order of magnitude as shape anisotropy. \\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\center\n    \\includegraphics[width=.35\\linewidth]{./fig12a.eps}\n    \\includegraphics[width=.63\\linewidth]{./fig12b.eps} \n\\caption{(a) ZFC-FC measurements performed on a Ge$_{0.93}$Mn$_{0.07}$ sample grown at 122$^{\\circ}$C.

As we can see, SQUID measurements are much more sensitive to the presence of Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters, even at low concentration, than TEM and x-ray diffraction used in section \\ref{structural}. We also observe a sharp transition in the ZFC curve (see Fig. 7b, Fig. 12a and 12b): the peak becomes very large and is shifted towards high blocking temperatures (the signal is maximum at $T=$23 K). This can be easily understood as a magnetic percolation of the four independent nanostructures obtained at low growth temperatures into a single magnetic nanocolumn. Therefore the magnetic volume increases sharply as well as blocking temperatures. At the same time, the size distribution widens as observed in TEM. In Fig. 12a, we have performed ZFC-FC measurements at different $T_{0}$ temperatures. The ZFC-FC irreversibility is observed up to the Curie temperature of $\\approx$120 K meaning that a fraction of nanocolumns is ferromagnetic (\\textit{i.e.} $T_{B}\\geq T_{C}$).",
      "In Fig. 12b, in-plane and out-of-plane ZFC curves nearly superimpose for $T\\leq$150 K due to the isotropic magnetic behavior of the nanocolumns: in-plane magnetoelastic anisotropy is still compensating out-of-plane shape anisotropy. Moreover the magnetic signal above 150 K corresponding to Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters that start to form in this growth temperature range is strongly anisotropic. This perpendicular anisotropy confirms the epitaxial relation: (0002) Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ $\\parallel$ (002) Ge discussed in Ref.\\cite{Bihl06}. The magnetic easy axis of the clusters lies along the hexagonal $c$-axis which is perpendicular to the film plane. \\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\center\n   \\includegraphics[width=.35\\linewidth]{./fig13a.eps}\n   \\includegraphics[width=.63\\linewidth]{./fig13b.eps} \n\\caption{(a) ZFC-FC measurements performed on a Ge$_{0.887}$Mn$_{0.113}$ sample grown at 145$^{\\circ}$C.

Superparamagnetic nanostructures are investigated performing ZFC-FC measurements at different $T_{0}$ temperatures (Fig. 13a). The first ZFC peak at low temperature \\textit{i.e.} $\\leq$ 150 K is attributed to  low-$T_{C}$ nanocolumns ($T_{C}\\approx$130 K). This peak is wider than for lower growth temperatures and its maximum is further shifted up to 30 K. These results are in agreement with TEM observations: increasing $T_{g}$ leads to larger nanocolumns (\\textit{i.e.} higher blocking temperatures) and wider size distributions. ZFC-FC irreversibility is observed up to the Curie temperature due to the presence of ferromagnetic columns. The second peak above 180 K in the ZFC curve is attributed to Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters and the corresponding ZFC-FC irreversibility persisting up to 300 K means that some clusters are ferromagnetic.",
      "As we do not observe hysteresis loops at low temperature, we believe that at this Mn concentration nanocolumns are  superparamagnetic in the whole temperature range and the blocking temperature cannot be measured. For higher Mn contents, the ZFC curve exhibits a very narrow peak with a maximum at the blocking temperature of 15 K whatever the Mn concentration and growth temperature (see Fig. 7b). Therefore the anisotropy barrier distribution is narrow and assuming that nanocolumns have the same magnetic anisotropy, this is a consequence of the very narrow size distribution of the nanocolumns as observed by TEM. To probe the anisotropy barrier distribution, we have performed ZFC-FC measurements but instead of warming the sample up to 400 K, we stopped at a lower temperature $T_{0}$. \n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\center\n   \\includegraphics[width=.6\\linewidth]{./fig9.eps}\n\\caption{Schematic drawing of the anisotropy barrier distribution n($E_{B}$) of superparamagnetic nanostructures.

In this drawing the blocking temperature ($T_{B}$) corresponds to the distribution maximum. At a given temperature $T_{0}$ such that 25$k_{B}T_{0}$ falls into the anisotropy barrier distribution, the largest nanostructures with an anisotropy energy larger than 25$k_{B}T_{0}$ are blocked whereas the others are superparamagnetic.}\n\\label{fig9}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIf this temperature falls into the anisotropy barrier distribution as depicted in Fig. 9, the FC curve deviates from the ZFC curve. Indeed the smallest nanostructures have become superparamagnetic at $T_{0}$ and when decreasing again the temperature, their magnetization freezes along a direction close to the magnetic field and the FC susceptibility is higher than the ZFC susceptibility. Therefore any irreversibility in this procedure points at the presence of superparamagnetic nanostructures. The results are given in Fig. 10a. ZFC and FC curves clearly superimpose up to $T_{0}$=250 K thus the nanocolumns are superparamagnetic up to their Curie temperature and no Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters could be detected.",
      "We clearly evidence the out-of-plane anisotropy of Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters and the isotropic magnetic behavior of nanocolumns (Fig. 13b). In this growth temperature range, we have also investigated the Mn concentration dependence of magnetic properties. \\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\center\n    \\includegraphics[width=.49\\linewidth]{./fig14a.eps}\n    \\includegraphics[width=.49\\linewidth]{./fig14b.eps} \n\\caption{Temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization (in $\\mu_{B}$/Mn) of Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films grown at 150$^{\\circ}$C plotted for different Mn concentrations: 2.3 \\%; 4 \\%; 7 \\%; 9 \\%; 11.3 \\%.

Above 7 \\%, the magnetic signal mainly comes from nanocolumns and Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters. We can derive more information from ZFC-FC measurements (Fig. 14b). Indeed, for 2.3 \\% of Mn, ZFC and FC curves nearly superimpose down to low temperature meaning that nanocolumns are superparamagnetic in the whole temperature range. Moreover the weak irreversibility arising at 300 K  means that some Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters have already formed in the samples even at very low Mn concentrations. For 4 \\% of Mn, we can observe a peak with a maximum at the blocking temperature (12 K) in the ZFC curve. We can also derive the Curie temperature of nanocolumns: $\\approx$45 K. The irresversibility arising at 300 K still comes from Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters. Increasing the Mn concentration above 7 \\% leads to: higher blocking temperatures (20 K and 30 K) due to larger nanocolumns and wider ZFC peaks due to wider size distributions in agreement with TEM observations (see Fig. 3a)."

It\u2019s where Will Lockwood graduated from high school. It\u2019s where he enrolled at Marshall University. It\u2019s where he first tried OxyContin. By the time Lockwood entered Marshall, Detroit dealers were trickling into Huntington, selling OxyContin and pills with OxyContin\u2019s active ingredient, oxycodone. Even though Lockwood could step out his front door and get the drug, Detroit street dealers weren\u2019t the preferred supplier, they were in Florida. It may have been 1,000 miles away, but to Lockwood, getting OxyContin and oxycodone from Florida\u2019s loosely regulated pain clinics \u201cwas legal, in a sense.\u201d Twice a month, different \u201ccrews\u201d from Huntington crowded into vans and headed south to Palm Beach and Broward counties, home to more than 200 pill mills, the pain clinics where anyone with a fake ache and hard cash could walk out with pills and prescriptions. After hitting a string of clinics, the Huntington crews drove back with \u201caround 500 to 600 pills per person,\u201d said Lockwood. But it wasn\u2019t just a few hundred pills. It was tens of thousands. And it wasn\u2019t just Huntington, The West Virginia vans were part of a nationwide caravan heading to South Florida. Cars bearing tags from Kentucky, Tennessee, the Carolinas, Virginia and Ohio crowded into one clinic parking lot after another, loading up on pills and prescriptions.",
      "A Palm Bay man\u2019s Puerto Rican family bought local pills destined for the working class town of Holyoke, Mass. In Rhode Island, police pulled over a Lauderhill man caught speeding through Providence. They found 903 oxycodone tablets and 56 morphine pills in the car. Senior citizen and Tulane business graduate Joel Shumrak funneled more than 1 million pills into eastern Kentucky from his South Florida and Georgia clinics, much of it headed for street sales \u2014 an estimated 20 percent of the illicit oxycodone in the entire state. Van loads of pill-seekers organized by \u201cVIP buyers\u201d traveled from Columbus, Ohio, to three Jacksonville clinics, where armed guards handled crowd control (federal indictment) and doctors generated prescriptions totaling 3.2 million pills in six months. In Miami, Vinny Colangelo created 1,500 internet website names to entice drug users throughout the nation to one of his six South Florida pain clinics or pharmacies. Even the Mafia got in on the Florida oxy express action: A Bonanno crime family associate oversaw a local crew stocking up on Palm Beach and Broward pain clinic oxycodone, upstreaming profits to the New York family. At times, it seemed almost no section of the country was free of Florida-supplied pills: When Olubenga Badamosi was arrested driving his Bentley Continental in Miami in 2011, the Oregon man was one of two traffickers overseeing a crew smuggling South Florida oxycodone to sell in Salt Lake City, Seattle and Denver as well as Oregon, Nevada, Texas and even Alaska. Pharmacy delivers oxy \u2018pot of gold\u2019\nIt would be hard to overstate Florida\u2019s role in feeding the country\u2019s voracious appetite for oxycodone. Oxycodone 30-milligram tablets were favored by addicts. And in 2009 and 2010, roughly four of every 10 of those pills were sold in Florida. Small wonder: Of the nation\u2019s top 100 oxycodone-buying doctors, 90 were in Florida. Pharmacies, too, ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies.",
      "Deaths tied to all drugs claimed 25 a day. In the handful of Appalachian states where traffickers were bringing back South Florida pills, it was worse. Ohio\u2019s death rate for oxycodone and similar opioids had doubled in 24 months, federal records show. Kentucky\u2019s was up by more than 50 percent. And in West Virginia, home to hard-hit Huntington, death rates tied to pill mill drugs such as oxycodone and Opana had climbed by 341 percent. The DEA formally pinpointed Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties as the nation\u2019s single biggest hub for trafficking pills across state lines. Within weeks of being sworn in, Scott abolished Florida\u2019s Office of Drug Control, eliminating the state drug czar position, announced plans to drive a final stake in the heart of the database and rebuffed Purdue Pharma\u2019s renewed offer to help pay for it. Scott, a tea party conservative, cited privacy concerns, expressed skepticism the monitoring program would work and raised the possibility taxpayers would be left with a $500,000-a-year bill to operate it. Attorney General Pam Bondi had also ridden the tea party wave to her position. She shared many of Scott\u2019s conservative convictions. Unlike Scott, the former prosecutor relentlessly lobbied to keep the database alive. Florida\u2019s failure to adopt the drug monitoring database was so out of step with the rest of the country that it began spawning conspiracy theories on both sides of the law. Everyone knew prescription monitoring was going to kill the pill smuggling business, said a corrupt Florida Highway Patrol trooper as he drove a load of pills out of Florida, according to a federal lawsuit. Talking to the confidential informant in the seat next to him, the trooper speculated someone in Tallahassee must have a piece of the action, \u201cbecause (Scott) was so adamant about not putting that system in place.

Answer: \u201cThe Oxy Express Explained\u201d\n(MASS TORT NEXUS MEDIA)\nA COMPARISON OF OXYCODONE PRESCRIBING\nIn the first six months of 2010, Ohio doctors and health care practitioners bought the second-largest number of oxycodone doses in the country at just under 1 million pills. Florida doctors bought 40.8 million in the same period, the comparison is astounding, yet it flew under the DEA, Opioid Big Pharma and everyone elses radar for years and years. Of the country\u2019s top 50 oxycodone-dispensing clinics, 49 were in Florida. From August 2008 to November 2009, a new pain clinic opened in Broward and Palm Beach counties on average of every three days. Pharmacies and distributors are at fault as well, pharmacies ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from opioid drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies. 90 of 100 of the nation\u2019s top 100 oxy-buying doctors in 2010, were in Florida. 49 of 50 of the country\u2019s top oxy-dispensing clinics were in Florida. For some reason this didn\u2019t raise an alarm or cause anyone to look further at the time. Purdue Pharma New What Was Happening In Florida\nPurdue and the Sacklers chose to ignore Florida, because apparently nobody there sued them or complained. In 2007, in other states, the infamous drug maker and three of its executives pled guilty in federal court and paid out $634.5 million in fines for purposefully misleading regulators, doctors, and patients about the addictiveness of their opioid painkiller. Around the same time, Purdue was also sued by several states, including Washington, over similar allegations. Purdue agreed to a $19.5 million multi-state settlement. And in 2015, Purdue settled a case with Kentucky, agreeing to pay $24 million. As part of the state settlements, Purdue was supposed to set up monitoring programs to make sure that its opioid drug didn\u2019t wind up in the wrong hands. It was supposed to watch out for shady pharmacies, unusually large orders, or suspiciously frequent orders.",

      "We found that the reactivation of the OA1 transgene is neither abolished, nor reduced by KO of GCN2, thus excluding that this kinase is necessary for the response to EAA starvation in HeLa-OA1 cells (Fig 6B and 6C). Fig 6. GCN2 knockout does not interfere with transgene reactivation in HeLa cells. (A) Immunoblotting of protein extracts from the HeLa-OA1 parental cell line and GCN2-KO clones 183#11, 185#5 and 239#1, immunodecorated with anti-GCN2 antibody. Arrow, GCN2 specific band. Ponceau staining was used as loading control. (B, C) Relative transgene (OA1) mRNA abundance in HeLa-OA1 cells and GCN2-KO clones, cultured in Met/Cys (B) or Thr (C) deprived medium for 24 h or 48 h, respectively, compared to full medium. Mean \u00b1 SD of 3 technical replicates from 1 experiment. Data are expressed as fold change vs. control (full medium = 1). Since independent clones may display variable reactivation responses (e.g. due to different levels of transgene expression in basal conditions), the results are not shown as means of the three clones, but as separate replicates. Similarly, we generated GCN2-KO clones from the parental HepG2-OA1 cell line by the same strategy. By using a guide RNA against exon 1 of the GCN2 gene, we obtained three independent GCN2-KO clones, namely E23, F22 and F27. Genomic characterization confirmed the presence of mutations on both alleles of exon 1 of the GCN2 gene in clone F27 (S7 Fig) and all three clones showed a very low amount\u2014if any\u2014of residual GCN2 protein, compared to the original HepG2-OA1 cell line (Fig 7A). To assess the ability of GCN2-KO cells to reactivate the transgene upon starvation, we cultured parental HepG2-OA1 cells and the three GCN2-KO clones in media deprived of Met/Cys or His (corresponding to the most effective treatments in this cell line; see Fig 3B) for 24 h, and evaluated the transgene expression by RT-qPCR. As shown in Fig 7B and 7C, we found that the reactivation of the OA1 transgene is neither abolished, nor reduced by KO of GCN2, as in HeLa cells.",
      "Thus, while the ISR appears widely activated upon EAA starvation, the upregulation of its downstream effector CHOP only partly correlates with transgene reactivation and may not be sufficient to induce it. The activation of the ISR upon AA starvation suggests that GCN2 may be involved in the transgene reactivation response. Therefore, we tested whether direct pharmacological activation of this kinase is sufficient to trigger the transgene reactivation similarly to starvation. In addition, we used pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR to corroborate previous negative results in HeLa cells  in the other cell lines under study. To this aim, HeLa-OA1 or GFP, HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of PP242 (mTOR inhibitor) or L-Histidinol (GCN2 activator, inhibiting tRNAHis charging by histidyl-tRNA synthetase), either alone or in combination for 24 h, compared to Met/Cys-deprived and full medium. As shown in Fig 4 and S5 Fig, while inhibition of mTORC1 consistently leads to minor or no effects, in agreement with previous findings , treatment with L-Histidinol results in efficient reactivation of the transgene in HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells, but not in HeLa cells. Fig 4. mTOR inhibition and GCN2 activation differently affect transgene expression in HeLa and HepG2 cells. Relative transgene (OA1) and CHOP mRNA abundance in HeLa-OA1 (A) and HepG2-OA1 (B) cells, cultured in Met/Cys-deprived medium, or in the presence of PP242 (mTOR inhibitor; 1\u20133 \u03bcM) or L-Histidinol (HisOH, GCN2 activator; 4\u201316 mM), either alone or in combination for 24\u201348 h, compared to full medium. Mean \u00b1 SEM of 4 (A) or 3 (B) independent experiments. Data are expressed as fold change vs. control (full medium = 1). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 (one way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett\u2019s post-test vs. full medium). PP-1 and PP-3, PP242 at 1 and 3 \u03bcM, respectively; HisOH-4 and HisOH-16, L-Histidinol at 4 and 16 mM, respectively. Specifically, L-Histidinol is not effective in HeLa-OA1 and HeLa-GFP cells, either alone or in combination with PP242 (Fig 4A and S5A Fig), or by using different concentrations of the drug, with or without serum (not shown).",
      "To further confirm this result, we knocked-down GCN2 by RNA interference (RNAi), and incubated the cells with or without L-Histidinol for 6 h. As shown in Fig 8, treatment of HepG2-OA1 cells with L-Histidinol results in efficient transgene reactivation, even upon significant GCN2 downregulation, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Taken together, these data strongly support the conclusion that GCN2 is not necessary for transgene reactivation in response to EAA starvation, either in HeLa or in HepG2 cells. Fig 7. GCN2 knockout does not interfere with transgene reactivation in HepG2 cells. (A) Immunoblotting of protein extracts from the HepG2-OA1 parental cell line and GCN2-KO clones 185#27, E23, F22, F27, immunodecorated with anti-GCN2 antibody.

      "Fig 3. EAA deprivation induces reactivation of silent transgenes in HeLa and HepG2 cells. Relative transgene (OA1) and CHOP mRNA abundance in HeLa-OA1 (A) and HepG2-OA1 (B) cells, cultured in various AA-deprived media for 48 h and 24 h, respectively, compared to full medium. Mean \u00b1 SEM of 3 independent experiments. Data are expressed as fold change vs. control (full medium = 1). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 (one way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett\u2019s post-test vs. full medium). Collectively, these results indicate that transgene reactivation by EAA starvation is reproducible with most EAAs, shared by different cell types (epithelium, liver, and skeletal muscle), and conserved in different mammalian species (human, mouse). mTORC1 inhibition and GCN2 activation trigger the best-known signaling pathways responding to AA starvation . We previously showed that inhibition of mTORC1 is not sufficient to reproduce transgene reactivation in HeLa cells . By contrast, the involvement of GCN2 and the ISR, including the downstream effectors ATF4 and CHOP, has never been tested. In addition, this pathway has been typically assessed in transient assays, lasting for a few hours, which may not be comparable with the prolonged starvation conditions necessary to reactivate the transgene expression (at least 15\u201324 h). Thus, we tested whether CHOP expression was upregulated upon incubation of HeLa-OA1, HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells in media deprived of different EAAs for 24\u201348 h. As shown in Fig 3 and S4B Fig, we found that CHOP expression is increased in all EAA-starvation conditions, but not in the absence of Ala, in all tested cell lines. Similar, yet less pronounced, results were obtained with ATF4, consistent with the notion that activation of this transcription factor is mainly mediated by translational upregulation (not shown) [15, 26]. However, the upregulation of CHOP does not parallel quantitatively that of the transgene, neither appears sufficient to induce it. In fact, CHOP is highly upregulated even upon Trp starvation, which consistently results in no or minimal reactivation of the transgenes (compare CHOP with OA1 or GFP expression; Fig 3 and S4B Fig).",
      "To this aim, we used Salubrinal, a specific phosphatase inhibitor that blocks both constitutive and ER stress-induced phosphatase complexes against eIF2\u03b1, thereby increasing its phosphorylation . We found that, while the ISR is activated upon Salubrinal treatment, as shown by increased CHOP expression, it does not induce OA1 transgene reactivation (Fig 5B). Fig 5. The ISR is neither sufficient nor necessary to induce transgene reactivation in HepG2 cells. (A) Schematic representation of GCN2 activation by AA starvation, resulting in phosphorylation of eIF2a and initiation of the downstream ISR.

Using Lemma 4, we can write where Mirroring and renumerating \u03b6 k , \u03b7 k , k is similar as for Y * k , k = 1, ..., T . Using the above representation, one can write First we reduce the supremum to a maximum over a finite number of points. If q > 1, then W (\u2022, x k ) is Lipschitz continuous with constant L > 0. In this case, it holds almost surely that sup ) is a piecewise linear function with knots at x j = j/ T . The factor (\u03b6 k + \u03be k ) can be considered as stochastic weights that do not affect the piecewise linear property. Thus, the supremum is attained at one of the knots x j = j/ T , j = 1, ..., T , and (A.7) is also valid for q = 1. Again with (a + b) 2 \u2264 2a 2 + 2b 2 we obtain We start with bounding .

We use the fact that for not necessarily independent random variables X 1 , ..., X N R and R > 0 are constants. This is a consequence of Lemma 1 of which yields , it follows that N i=1 a i X i has a subGaussain distribution and the subGaussian norm is bounded by 2R( N i=1 a 2 i ) 1/2 .

Finally, Lemma 4 gives explicit bounds for the stochastic and deterministic errors of the variance stabilizing transform. Thus, it quantifies the difference to an exact Gaussian regression setting.

Thus, for 0 < t < a and t independent of a, equation (A.17) implies for a \u2192 \u221e that \u0393(a + t)/\u0393(a) = O(a t ). Similarly, it can be seen that \u0393(a \u2212 t)/\u0393(a) = O(a \u2212t ). If 0 < t < a and t linearly depends on a, i.e. t = ca for some constant c \u2208 (0, 1), then we get \u0393(a \u00b1 t)/\u0393(a) = O(a \u00b1t exp{a}) for a \u2192 \u221e.\nHence, for a fixed \u03bb not depending on n, p and such that 0 < \u03bb < m/( \u221a 2M j ) we get for sufficiently large n, p If \u03bb = cm such that 0 < \u03bb < m/( \u221a 2M j ), then for sufficiently large n, p b\u2208{c\u03b4/m,cM 0 /m} (bm/2) for some constant L > 1.

In particular, q = \u03b3 and f (q) is \u03b1-H\u00f6lder continuous. Since f is a periodic function with f (x) \u2208 [\u03b4, M 0 ] and H(y) \u221d \u03c6(m/2)+ log (2y/m), it follows that {H(f )} (q) is also \u03b1-H\u00f6lder continuous. Extending g := H(f ) to the entire real line, we get Expanding g(t) in a Taylor series around x and using that h \u22121 K h is a kernel of order 2q, see Lemma 2(iii), it follows that for any x \u2208 [0, 1]\nwhere \u03be x,t is a point between x and t. Using the fact that the kernel K h decays exponentially and that g (q) is \u03b1-H\u00f6lder continuous on [\u03b4, M 0 ] with some constant L, the logarithm is Lipschitz continuous on a compact interval, it follows g = H(f ) is \u03b2-H\u00f6lder continuous. Expanding g to the entire line and using Lemma 2(iii) with\nIn a similar way as before, one obtains Note that T \u2212\u03b2 =o(h \u03b2 ) as \u03b2 > 1/2, T h \u2192 \u221e and h \u2192 0 by assumption. Since the derived bounds are uniform for x \u2208 [0, 1] it holds Putting the bounds A.13 and A.14 together gives If h > 0 such that h \u2192 0 and hT \u2192 \u221e, then with T = p \u03c5 for any \u03c5 \u2208 ((4 \u2212 2 min{1, \u03b2})/3, 1), the estimator f described in Section 3 with q = max{1, \u03b3} satisfies\nProof : By the mean value theorem, it holds for some function g between H(f ) and To show that the second term on the right hand side of (A.15) is negligible we use the moment generating function of H(f ) \u221e .",
      "The results are established under the asymptotic scenario where p \u2192 \u221e and p/n \u2192 c \u2208 (0, \u221e], that is, the dimension p grows, while the sample size n either remains fixed or also grows but not faster than p. This corresponds to the asymptotic scenario when the sample covariance matrix is inconsistent. Let f be the spectral density estimator defined in Section 3, i.e., f = m exp{ \u221a 2 H(f ) \u2212 \u03c6(m/2)}/2, where H(f ) is given in (4), m = np/T and \u03c6 is the digamma function. Furthermore, let \u03a3 be the Toeplitz covariance matrix estimator and \u03a9 the corresponding precision matrix defined in equations ( ) and (6), respectively. The following theorem shows that both \u03a3 and \u03a9 attain the minimax optimal rate of convergence over the class and hT \u2192 \u221e, then with T = p \u03c5 for any \u03c5 \u2208 ((4 \u2212 2 min{\u03b2, 1})/3, 1) and q = max{1, \u03b3}, the spectral density estimator f , the corresponding covariance matrix estimator \u03a3 and the precision matrix estimator \u03a9 satisfy sup\nFor h {log(np)/(np)} . The proof of Theorem 1 can be found in the Appendix A.3 and is the main result of our work. The most important part of this proof is the derivation of the convergence rate for the spectral density estimator f under the L \u221e norm. In the original work, established an L 2 rate for a wavelet nonparametric mean estimator in a gamma regression where the data are assumed to be independent. In our work, the spectral density estimator f is based on the gamma distributed data W i,1 , . . . , W i,p , which are only asymptotically independent. Moreover, the mean of these data is not exactly f (\u03c0x 1 ), . . . , f (\u03c0x p ), but is corrupted by the diagonalization error given in Lemma 1. This error adds to the error that arises via binning and VST and that describes the deviation from a Gaussian distribution, as derived in . Finally, we need to obtain an L \u221e rather than an L 2 rate for our spectral density estimator. Overall, the proof requires different tools than those used in . To get the L \u221e rate for f , we first derive that for the periodic smoothing spline estimator H(f ) of the log-spectral density."

If $ N + \\alpha -2 <0$ then using Remark \\ref{triv}  one easily sees there is no stable sub-solution of $(G)$ and $(L)$ (positive for $(L)$) or a positive stable super-solution of $(M)$. So we now assume that $ N + \\alpha -2 > 0$.     Note that the monotonicity of $ \\omega_1$ changes when $ \\alpha $ changes sign and hence one would think that we need to consider separate cases if we hope to utilize the monotonicity results. But a computation shows that in fact $ I$ and $J$ are just multiples of each other in all three cases so it suffices to show, say, that $ \\lim_{R \\rightarrow \\infty} I =0$. \\\\\n(2). Note that for $ R >1$ one has\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nI_G & \\le  & \\frac{C}{R^{4t+2}} \\int_{R <|x| < 2R} |x|^{ \\alpha (2t+1) - 2t \\beta} \\\\\n& \\le  &  \\frac{C}{R^{4t+2}}  R^{N + \\alpha (2t+1) - 2t \\beta},\n\\end{eqnarray*} and so to show the non-existence we want to find some $ 0 <t<2$ such that\n$  4t+2 > N  + \\alpha(2t+1) - 2 t \\beta$,   which is equivalent to  $ 2t ( \\beta - \\alpha +2) > (N + \\alpha -2)$.    Now recall that we are assuming that $ 0 < N + \\alpha -2 < 4 ( \\beta - \\alpha +2) $ and hence we have the desired result by taking $  t <2$ but sufficiently close. The proof of the non-existence results for\n(3) and (4) are similar and we omit the details. \\\\\n(5). We now assume that $N+\\alpha-2>0$.  In showing the existence of stable sub/super-solutions we need to consider  $ \\beta - \\alpha + 2 <0$ and $ \\beta - \\alpha +2 >0$ separately. \\begin{itemize} \\item $(\\beta - \\alpha + 2 <0)$ Here we take $ u(x)=0$ in the case of $(G)$ and $ u=1$ in the case of $(L)$ and $(M)$. In addition we take $ g(x)=\\E$. It is clear that in all cases $u$ is the appropriate sub or super-solution. The only thing one needs to check is the stability. In all cases this reduces to trying to show that we have\n\\[ \\sigma \\int       (1+|x|^2)^{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}  -1}    \\phi^2 \\le \\int      (1+|x|^2)^{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}   | \\nabla\\phi  |^2,\\]  for all $ \\phi \\in C_c^\\infty$ where  $ \\sigma $ is some small positive constant; its either $ \\E$ or $ p \\E$ depending on which equation were are examining.

So, the integrand function in the right hand side is positive and since for small enough $\\sigma$ we have\n  \\begin{equation*}\n\\sigma \\le  (t+\\frac{\\alpha}{2})(N-2(t+1)   \\frac{|x|^2}{1+|x|^2})  \\ \\ \\",

      "In other words, the observations the human provides can be defined conditioned only on the robot location, the goal, and the human's preference for its current vertex p v . By introducing this assumption, each update step only requires updating the joint (p v , g), reducing the number of cost computations to |N (v)| \u00d7 m g . We can notice that by introducing this assumption, we removed the direct relationship between the number of polytopes in the environment and the complexity of the Bayesian update in eq. ( ). In practice, components of \u03b8 are not mutually independent. For example, if the human preference at a vertex v 1 is\n, it is unlikely that the human will also prefer p v2 = (v 2 , v 1 ) (turning back). We can improve our model by assuming a dependent relationship between preferences for adjacent edges, which does not significantly increase the complexity of the inference problem. An interesting property of our encoding is that any two paths that belong to different homotopy classes will cross different sequences of polytopes, i.e. they correspond to a different sequence of edges on G.\nThis can be proved by contradiction. Let us suppose that two continuous trajectories \u03be 1 and \u03be 2 , with the same start and end points and that do not intersect any obstacle, traverse the same regions in G in the same order. From the construction of the hyperplane arrangement, each polytope that the paths traverse through is obstacle-free. Therefore, within each polytope, there is no obstacle in the area located in between the portions of \u03be 1 and \u03be 2 that belong to the region. A smooth transformation of \u03be 1 into \u03be 2 can be obtained by transforming each portion of \u03be 1 belonging to the polytopes it intersects into the corresponding portion of \u03be 2 for the same polytopes, where the extremities of the trajectory portions are connected to one another along the polytope's edges (where the same edge is crossed by both paths). Along this transformation, the paths do not intersect any obstacle, and therefore \u03be 1 and \u03be 2 belong to the same homotopy class.",
      "We further assume that having chosen a goal and path preference, the human takes actions to noisily minimize a cost function C g,\u03b8 that measures the cost of moving from the robot's current location to the goal along the preferred path. For example, C g,\u03b8 (s t , o t ) can be the length of the shortest path from location s t to the goal g after taking a first step to o t , and constrained by path preference \u03b8. We use C g,\u03b8 to induce a probability distribution over observations, given by: where \u03b3 h is a hyperparameter that designates the rationality coefficient. This model assumes the human will pick the lowest cost action with the highest probability and the likelihood of an action decreases exponentially with the increase in cost . Our inclusion of the path preference \u03b8 sets our approach apart from . The model is shown in fig. represented as a Bayesian Network. Inference\n\nAt each time step where the human provides an observation, the posterior P (g, \u03b8) is given through the Bayesian update We note that the number of Bayesian updates required at each iteration to update the belief is equal to the cardinality of \u2126 g \u00d7 \u0398. In addition, each Bayesian update involves computing C g,\u03b8 ( .\n, . ) in eq. ( ), which involves solving an optimization problem (such as a shortest path problem). In section IV, we propose a specific encoding of preference \u03b8 for resolving eq. ( ), while ensuring the number of computations of the cost C g,\u03b8 (., .) per update does not grow exponentially with the number of obstacles. Decision Making\n\nWe consider a navigation problem where the robot receives reward according to the model R(s t , g, \u03b8, a t ). We wish to find the optimal policy \u03c0 that maximizes the expected discounted sum of future rewards, with discount factor \u03b3. The above problem is a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) . In this section, we propose an encoding of human's path preference \u03b8 for computing the posterior in eq. ( ). Devifrom the concept of homotopy classes, we define the preference according to a partitioning of the environment into polytopes, as shown in fig. , creating a hyperplane arrangement of the space.",
      "Our solution is to encode path preference based on a partitioning of the environment into polytopes . This representation allows path preferences to be expressed as sets of preferred transitions between adjacent polytopes. Paths belonging to different homotopy classes correspond to different sequences of transitions. By leveraging conditional independence assumptions, we can make the Bayesian inference problem tractable. These assumptions exploit the fact that human actions provide information about the path in a piece-wise manner. For example, indicating a preference for navigating around a particular obstacle only provides information about the local area and not the entire path. Finally, after updating its belief representation over the human's preference, the robot can adapt to indications by replanning online. Our contributions are as follows. \u2022 We formulate the human-robot collaboration problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) where both the goal of the task and the human's path preference are unknown random variables. \u2022 We propose an encoding of a human's path preference using a partitioning of the environment into polytopes, along with conditional independence assumptions that make the Bayesian inference problem tractable to infer the task goal and path preference online. \u2022 Through simulations in two environments of different sizes and complexity, we show that our method is effective for solving problems where the robot must reach a goal that is unknown a-priori while simultaneously adapting to a human's indications. Our method shows higher success rates compared to baseline approaches when the human inputs are sparse. Our approach enables a robot to make effective navigation decisions in collaboration with a human, even when the goal and path preference are not known in advance, and with minimal human input. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in shared autonomy and interactive systems, where humans and robots work together to accomplish tasks.",
      "Specifically, we model the human's preference over different homotopy classes and leverage a conditional independence assumption to provide a tractable solution. In our approach, we assume that the human's inputs are noisily rational conditioned on both the goal and the preference. By jointly inferring the goal and path preference, we can avoid over-confidence in incorrect beliefs about the user's preferences, leading to improved system performance. We consider the problem of robot navigation in a known environment to an unknown destination, where a human can intervene and provide a heading direction to the robot using a joystick or force cues. The human also has a preference on which path the robot should take with respect to obstacles, and our objective is for the robot to understand the human's intentions and execute the task with minimal interventions. Let g be a discrete random variable denoting the goal of the task, belonging to a set of candidates \u2126 g , and let \u03b8 be a discrete-valued random variable representing the human's path preference, belonging to a set of possible preferences \u0398. The physical location of the robot at time index t is denoted by s t \u2208 R 2 , and the robot's action at time index t, belonging to some action space A, is denoted by a t . The transition model T (s t+1 | s t , a t ) is deterministic, meaning the robot has full control over its future location. At any time step, the human may provide an observation to the robot. When the human intervenes, the robot receives a direction (heading angle) that can be mapped to a future location in space. More specifically, we map the direction to an intended location, which is the resulting robot location after advancing in the indicated direction for one time step. For simplicity, we consider that the robot directly makes an observation o t of the location indicated by the human. We assume that the robot has a stochastic observation model for the human P (o t | s t , g, \u03b8) that is conditioned on both the goal of the task g and the human's preferred path \u03b8.",
      "This problem is particularly challenging when both the goal and path preference are unknown a priori. To overcome this challenge, we propose a method for encoding and inferring path preference online using a partitioning of the space into polytopes. Our approach enables joint inference over the goal and path preference using a stochastic observation model for the human. We evaluate our method on an unknown-goal navigation problem with sparse human interventions, and find that it outperforms baseline approaches as the human's inputs become increasingly sparse. We find that the time required to update the robot's belief does not increase with the complexity of the environment, which makes our method suitable for online applications. INTRODUCTION\n\nCollaboration between humans and robots has become increasingly important and one key aspect of this collaboration is the ability for robots to adapt to human decisions. In many scenarios, such as a robot navigating through a busy room to deliver an item, it is important for the robot to take into account human preferences. For instance, humans may prefer a specific path that would allow their colleagues to notice the item being delivered, but this preference may change dynamically based on various factors such as changes in the environment or unforeseen circumstances. While some preferences can be incorporated into the path-planning process, accommodating dynamic user preferences in real-time remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a way to enable robots to adapt to human preferences dynamically by leveraging real-time feedback to inform decision-making. In this work, we tackle the problem of robot navigation in which the robot cannot observe the goal or the preferred path to the goal, but must make navigation decisions that are influenced by humans through recommended actions. Prior work has explored how to adapt to a human's preference through feedback, but such approaches often require a high level of intervention, which can be time-consuming and impractical in real-world scenarios."

      "Effects of specific-heat ratio on mixing degree\n\nThe mixing process is a fundamental research content on SBI. In two-fluid DBM, the mixing degree at each fluid unit can be defined as M = 4 \u2022 M A M B , where M \u03c3 represents the mass fraction of component \u03c3 . The higher the value of M, the higher the mixing amplitude. Images of density (first cow) and mixing degree M (second row) at several typical moments are shown in Fig. . As can be seen, the mass mixing occurs in the region where two media contact. In addition, the mixing degree M g described the whole fluid field can be defined where the symbol \"\u2212\" indicates integrating the M \u03c3 over the whole fluid field and then dividing the grid size N x \u2022 N y . Shown in Fig. is the temporal evolution of the global mixing degree M g . As can be seen, temporal profiles of the global mixing degree show two stages: t < 0.03 and t > 0.03. When t < 0.03, there is almost no difference between cases with various specific-heat ratios. But for t > 0.03, the stronger the specific-heat ratio effect, the larger the mixing degree. Actually, there are mainly two indicators that measure the global mixing degree: the amplitude of mixing and the area of the mixing zone between two fluids. At the stage t > 0.03, the shock compression dominates the mix by enhancing the mixing amplitude and increasing the area of the mixing zone simultaneously. In this stage, the specific-heat ratio effect contributes little to the mix. However, when the shock passes through the bubble, the deformation of interface and the evolution of vortex core both significantly raise the area of the mixing zone. As can be seen in Fig. , the smaller specific-heat ratio of bubble, the stronger global mixing degree of fluid field. Intuitively, for the fluid with smaller specific-heat ratio, it is easier to deform and compress, which is beneficial for the fluid mixing. It can also be explained by the diffusion formula, i.e., . The specific-heat ratio affects both the temperature T and the gradient of density simultaneously.",
      "Therefore, these two aspects comprehensively influence the material diffusion between the two fluids. Due to the complex reflected shock wave, the global mixing degree shows a tendency for oscillating growth. Effects of specific-heat ratio on TNE behaviors\n\nThe investigation of TNE behaviors is of great importance for understanding the kinetics process on SBI. These TNE quantities describe the fluid system deviating from the thermodynamic state from their own perspectives. The effects of specific-heat ratio on global TNE strength, i.e., D * 2 , D * 3 , D * 3,1 , and D * 4,2 , are shown in Fig. . It can be seen that the effects of specific-heat ratios on various TNE quantities are different. Theoretically, the influence of specific-heat ratio on the non-equilibrium effect is reflected in two aspects: transport coefficient and macroscopic quantity gradient. For example, on the one hand, the specific-heat ratio reduces heat conductivity, while on the other hand, it enhances the temperature gradient. Therefore, the effect of specific heat ratio on NOEF is the comprehensive result of the competition between the two aspects. As shown in Fig. , the smaller the specific-heat ratio, the stronger strength of D * 3,1 . It indicates that the specific-heat ratio increase the strength of D * 3,1 by raising the heat conductivity . For the strength of D * 3 , as shown in Fig. (b), it is seen that it decreases as the specific-heat ratio becomes small. The reason is that a smaller specific-heat ratio decreases the temperature gradient. Effects of specific-heat ratio on D * 4,2 show two-stage. In the shock compression stage (t < 0.03), the smaller specificheat ratio, the larger the strength of D * 4,2 . But the situation is reversed at the stage t > 0.03. For strength of D * 2 , the specificheat effects are more significant in later stage. Effects of specific-heat ratio on entropy production rate\n\nand entropy production The concepts of entropy are commonly used in complex flows . In DBM, there are two kinds of en- tropy production rates, i.e., \u1e60NOEF and \u1e60NOMF .",
      "Two kinds of analysis methods, including tracer particle method and two-fluid model, are used to characterize qualitatively the macroscopic behaviors such as the shape, deformation process, mixing degree, etc. The related TNE behaviors are also studied. Effects of specific-heat ratio on jet shape, deformation process, and average motion\n\nWe first observe the specific-heat ratio effect on the bubble shape from the view of density contour and images of particle tracer visually. As shown in Fig. , pictures with three typical moments are plotted, i.e., t = 0.07,t = 0.11, and t = 0.16. The odd rows represent density contours and the even rows are tracer particle images. It can be seen that the specific-heat ratio significantly affects the length and shape of the jet structure. The smaller the specific-heat ratio is, the stouter the jet structure can be seen. The reason is that the specific-heat ratio significantly changes the propagation speed of shock waves and wave patterns inside the bubble. The specific-heat ratio also influences the vortex structure in early stage but contributes little effects to it in later stage. In the later stage, for cases with different specific-heat ratios, the differences in vortex pairs are almost invisible. Then, the effects of specific-heat ratio on deformation process are analyzed. Shown in Fig. are the evolutions of characteristic scales which used to describe the bubble size, i.e., width and length. It can be seen that the smaller the specific-heat ratio of bubble, the smaller the bubble width and length. For the fluid with smaller specific-heat ratio, it is easier to be compressed. Therefore, the characteristic scales of bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio tend to be compressed smaller. It can also be seen that the case with the largest specific-heat ratio reaches the minimum characteristic scales firstly. The reason is that the shock wave propagates faster in case with larger specific-heat ratio. Through the method of tracer, information on the average motion of the bubble is easy to obtain.",
      "The larger the difference in specific-heat ratio between the bubble and ambient gas, the higher the degree of material mixing. Effects of specific-heat ratio on various TNE quantities are different. These differences consistently show the complexity of TNE flows which is still far from a clear understanding. In addition, it is found that the temporal evolution of the entropy production rates \u1e60NOMF and \u1e60NOEF both show three stages because of the influence of the shock wave location. The smaller the specific-heat ratio, the larger the velocity gradient, which indirectly enhances the strength of \u1e60NOMF . The specific-heat ratio increases the \u1e60NOEF by raising the temperature gradient. The influence of specific-heat ratio on S NOEF is more significant than that on S NOMF . Effects of specific-heat ratio on entropy production caused by NOMF and NOEF are contrary. Specifically, the entropy production contributed by NOMF increases with reduced specific-heat ratio. But the entropy production caused by NOEF first reduces with decreasing specific-heat ratio and then approaches to a saturation value. When the specific-heat ratio \u03b3 is smaller than a threshold value \u03b3 c (\u03b3 c \u2248 1.315), the entropy production induced by NOEF is more significant than that caused by NOMF. However, in the case of \u03b3 > \u03b3 c , the situation reverses. The fundamental research in this paper helps to understand the interaction mechanism between shock waves and bubbles in ICF, supersonic combustors, underwater explosions, etc. The effects of viscosity and heat conduction on the interaction between shock waves and bubbles will be studied in the following work. where the subscript \"m, n\" means that the m-order tensor is contracted to n-order tensor. According to the CE multiscale analysis, the Boltzmann-BGK equation can be reduced to the hydrodynamic equations. In the following part, the derivation process from Boltzmann-BGK equation to a two-fluid hydrodynamic equation are shown. More details can see the reference presented by Zhang et al. .",
      "The difference between S NOMF and S NOEF increases with decreasing specific-heat ratio. Conclusions\n\nSpecific-heat ratio effects on the interaction between a planar shock wave and a 2-D heavy-cylindrical bubble are studied by a two-fluid DBM which has a flexible specific-heat ratio and includes several schemes for analyzing the complex physical fields. Besides the HNE that NS easily describes, the DBM pays more attention to the related TNE that NS is not convenient to describe. First, both the snapshots of schlieren images and evolutions of characteristic scales from DBM simulation are compared with those from experiment. The quantitative agreements between them indicate the following two facts: (i) the order of TNE considered in the current DBM is sufficient, (ii) the choosing of discrete velocities, spatial-temporal steps, and simulation parameters like the relaxation times are suitable for the following physical researches. Then, five cases with various specific-heat ratios are simulated. Several analysis methods for complex physical fields, including the description scheme of TNE behaviors, tracer particle method, and two-fluid model, are used to characterize the effects of specific-heat ratio on the bubble shape, deformation process, average motion, vortex motion, mixing degree of the fluid system, TNE strength, and entropy production. Specifically, for bubble shape, bubbles with different specific-heat ratios display various jet structures. The smaller the specific-heat ratio is, the stouter the jet structure can be seen. For the case with smaller specific-heat ratio, the fluid is easier to be compressed. So, the characteristic scales of bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio tend to be compressed smaller. For the bubble, the smaller the specific-heat ratio, the slower average motion. In the shock compression stage, the specific-heat ratio contributes little effects to the vortex motion. Differently, after the shock passes through the bubble, it significantly influences the vorticity around the interface and the corresponding amplitude of circulation due to the development of KHI."

      "By (\\ref{BigBDefinition}), the solution (\\ref{BSolution}) corresponds to the differential equation\n\\begin{equation}\n\\beta(r)\\beta'(r) = \\frac{C}{r^2}\n\\end{equation}\nfor our function $\\beta$; with another separation of variables, we can re-write this as \n\\begin{equation}\n\\beta\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\beta=C\\frac{\\mathrm{d} r}{r^2}. \\end{equation}\nBoth sides are readily integrated up; we can solve the result for $\\beta(r)$ and obtain\n\\begin{equation}\n\\beta(r) = \\sqrt{\n-\\frac{2C}{r} +2D\n},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $D$ is the second integration constant, and where we have chosen the proper sign, since we know that $\\beta(r)>0$. That brings us to the last step: The requirement that, for large values of $r$, the description provided by our solution should correspond to the results from Newtonian gravity. First of all, we note that our initial condition for the infalling observers, which had those observers start out at zero speed at infinity, means that we must choose $D=0$. Then, as we would expect, $\\beta(r)$ for large values of $r$ becomes very small, corresponding to small speeds. But at slow speeds, time and length intervals as measured by the infalling observer will become arbitrarily close to time and length intervals as measured by an observer at rest in our static coordinate system at constant $r$, using the static time coordinate ${t}$. As is usual, we identify these coordinates with those of an approximately Newtonian description. In that description, the radial velocity is\n\\begin{equation}\nv(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}},\n\\end{equation}\nwhich follows directly from energy conservation for the sum of each observer's kinetic and Newtonian-gravitational potential energy. This fixes the remaining integration constant as\n\\begin{equation}\nC = -\\frac{GM}{c^2},\n\\end{equation}\nand the final form of our function $\\beta(r)$ becomes\n\\begin{equation}\n\\beta(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{rc^2}}. \\end{equation}\nInserting this result in (\\ref{preMetric}), we obtain the metric\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d} s^2 = -c^2\\left[\n1-\\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\n\\right]\\mathrm{d} T^2+2\\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\\mathrm{d} r\\:\\mathrm{d} T+\\mathrm{d} r^2+r^2\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2.",

We know from (\\ref{betaDefinition}) that the derivative in the linear term can be expressed in terms of $\\beta(r)$; by the same token,\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 r}{\\mathrm{d} T^2} = -c\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\beta}{\\mathrm{d} T}=-c\\beta' \\frac{\\mathrm{d} r}{\\mathrm{d} T} = c^2\\beta\\cdot\\beta',\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the prime denotes differentiation of $\\beta$ with respect to its argument. Since, in the following, the product of $\\beta$ and its first derivative will occur quite often, let us introduce the abbreviation\n\\begin{equation}\nB(r) \\equiv \\beta(r)\\cdot\\beta'(r). \\label{BigBDefinition}\n\\end{equation} With these results, can rewrite the Taylor expansion (\\ref{TaylorREvo}) as \n\\begin{equation}\nr(T) = r_0 -c\\beta(r_0)\\cdot\\Delta T + \\frac12 c^2B(r_0)\\cdot\\Delta T^2. \\label{RadialOrbitTime}\n\\end{equation}\nIn order to find $r_C(T)$ for our central particle, we simply insert $r_0=R$ into that expression.

Since $\\Delta l$ is small, we can make a Taylor expansion of $\\beta(r)$ and its derivative around $r=R$, and neglect everything beyond the terms linear in $\\Delta l$.

      "But since the initial conditions for those observers are the same, and since our spacetime is, by assumption, static, the resulting function can only depend on $r$, and not explicitly on ${t}$. Let us rescale that function with the speed of light to make it dimensionless, give it an overall minus sign to make it positive for infalling particles, and call it $\\beta(r)$,\n\\begin{equation}\n\\beta(r)\\equiv -\\frac{1}{c}\\frac{\\mathrm{d} r}{\\mathrm{d} T}(r). \\label{betaDefinition}\n\\end{equation}\n\nRecall from section \\ref{SymmetriesCoordinates} that we also still have the freedom to decide on the physical meaning of $r$. We make the choice of making $\\mathrm{d} r$ the physical length measured by one of our infalling observers at the relevant location in spacetime, at constant time $T$. Via our angular coordinates, that implies that length measurements orthogonal to the radial direction, $r\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\vartheta$ and $r\\cdot\\sin\\vartheta\\:\\mathrm{d}\\varphi$ inherit the same physical interpretation. As a next step, we transform our metric (\\ref{StaticForm}) from the static form into the form appropriate for our coordinate choice $r$ and $T$. We do so by writing the static time coordinate as a function ${t}(T,r)$ in terms of infalling observer time and radius value. In consequence,\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d} {t} = \\frac{\\partial{t}}{\\partial T}\\cdot\\mathrm{d} T+ \\frac{\\partial {t}}{\\partial r}\\cdot\\mathrm{d} r,\n\\end{equation}\nand our new metric now has the form\n\\begin{align}\n \\mathrm{d} s^2 = {} & -c^2 F(r)\\left(\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial T}\\right)^2\\mathrm{d} T^2 \\nonumber \\\\[0.2em]\n & -2c^2F(r)\\left(\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial T}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial r}\\right)\\mathrm{d} T\\:\\mathrm{d} r \\nonumber \\\\[0.2em]\n & +\\left[G(r)-c^2F(r)\\left(\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial r}\\right)^2\\right]\\mathrm{d} r^2+r^2\\:\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2. \\end{align}\nAt face value, this looks like we are moving the wrong way, away from simplification, since we now have more functions, and they depend on two variables instead of one.",
      "The initial radial coordinate value for each of the particles is\n\\begin{equation}\nr(T_0) = \\sqrt{R^2+\\Delta l^2}=R\\left[1+\\frac12\\left(\\frac{\\Delta l}{R}\\right)^2\\right]\\approx R,\n\\end{equation}\nthat is, equal to $R,$ as long as we neglect any terms that are higher than linear in $\\Delta l$. In consequence, $r_{L,R}(t)$ is the same function as for our central particle, given by eq.~(\\ref{RadialOrbitTime}) with $r_0=R$. The transversal (in Fig.~\\ref{TestParticlesOutside}: horizontal) distance $d_{\\perp}(T)$ between the particles $L$ and $R$ changes in proportion to the radius value,\n\\begin{align}\nd_{\\perp}(T) &= 2\\Delta l\\cdot\\frac{r_{L}(T)}{R} \\nonumber \\\\\n                 &=2\\Delta \\left[1-\\frac{c\\beta(R)}{R}\\Delta T+\\frac{c^2}{2}\\frac{B(R)}{R}\\Delta T^2\\right]. \\label{dPerp}\n\\end{align}\nWith these preparations, consider the vacuum Einstein equation (\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) for the volume of a test ball. Initially, our particles $C, U, D, L, R$ define a circle, which is deformed to an ellipse. By demanding rotational symmetry around the radial direction, we can construct the associated ellipsoid, which is initially a spherical surface. That ellipsoid has one axis in radial direction, whose length is $d_{\\parallel}(T)$, and two axes that are transversal and each have the length  $d_{\\perp}(t)$. But that ellipsoid is not quite yet the test ball we need. After all, the particles of the test ball need to be at rest initially, at time $T_0$, in the co-moving system defined by the central particle $C$. Our defining particles are not, as the terms linear in $\\Delta T$ in both (\\ref{dParallel}) and (\\ref{dPerp}) show, where the coefficients of $\\Delta T$ correspond to the particles' initial velocities. In order to define our test ball, we need to consider particles at the same location, undergoing the same acceleration, but which are initially at rest relative to the central particle $C$. We could go back to the drawing board, back to Fig.~\\ref{TestParticlesOutside}, make a more general Ansatz that includes initial velocities which measure the divergence of the motion of our test ball particles from that of the infalling-observer particles, and repeat our calculation while including those additional velocity terms.",
      "It is the consequence of these special choices that gives the relation (\\ref{barRshift}) its simple form. Last but not least, when we analyse specifically an infinitesimal neighbourhood of the point $r,\\vartheta,\\varphi$, let us make the choice that directly at our point of interest, we make $\\bar{r}$ coincide with $r$. Since before, we had only fixed the differential $\\mathrm{d} \\bar{r}$, we do have the remaining freedom of choosing a constant offset for $\\bar{r}$ that yields the desired result. By Einstein's equivalence principle, the metric in terms of the locally co-moving coordinates $T,\\bar{r},\\vartheta,\\varphi$ is the spherical-coordinate version of the Minkowski metric,\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d} s^2 = -c^2\\mathrm{d} T^2 + \\mathrm{d}\\bar{r}^2 + \\bar{r}^2\\mathrm{d}\\Omega. \\end{equation}\nThis version can, of course, be obtained by taking the more familiar Cartesian-coordinate version\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d} s^2=-c^2\\mathrm{d} T^2 + \\mathrm{d} X^2 + \\mathrm{d} Y^2 + \\mathrm{d} Z^2,\n\\label{CartesianMinkowski}\n\\end{equation}\napplying the definition of Cartesian coordinates $X,Y,Z$ in terms of spherical coordinates $\\bar{r},\\vartheta,\\varphi$\n\\begin{equation}\nx= \\bar{r}\\:\\sin\\vartheta\\:\\cos\\varphi, \\;\\;\ny= \\bar{r}\\:\\sin\\vartheta\\:\\sin\\varphi, \\;\\;\nz= \\bar{r}\\:\\cos\\vartheta,\n\\end{equation}\nto express $\\mathrm{d} X, \\mathrm{d} Y, \\mathrm{d} Z$ in terms of $\\mathrm{d} \\bar{r}, \\mathrm{d}\\vartheta, \\mathrm{d}\\varphi$, and substitute the result into (\\ref{CartesianMinkowski}). By noting that we have chosen $\\bar{r}$ so that, at the specific spacetime event where we are evaluating the metric, $\\bar{r}=r$, while, for small radial coordinate shifts around that location, we have the relation (\\ref{barRshift}), we can now write down the same metric in the coordinates $T, r, \\vartheta,\\varphi$, namely as\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d} s^2 = -c^2\\left [\n1-\\beta(r)^2\n\\right] \\mathrm{d} T^2+2c\\beta(r)\\mathrm{d} r\\:\\mathrm{d} T\n+\\mathrm{d} r^2+r^2\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2. \\label{preMetric}\n\\end{equation}\nSince we can repeat that local procedure at any event in our spacetime, this result is our general form of the metric, for all values of $r$. This, then is the promised simplification: By exploiting the symmetries of our solutions as well as the properties of infalling observers, we have reduced our metric to a simple form with no more than one unknown function of one variable, namely $\\beta(r)$.\n\nSo far, what I have presented is no more than a long-form version of the initial steps of the derivation given by Visser in his heuristic derivation of the Schwarzschild metric.\\cite{Visser2005} In the next section, we will deviate from Visser's derivation."

      "Paper Info\n\nTitle: Age and market capitalization drive large price variations of cryptocurrencies\nPublish Date: 23 Feb 2023\nAuthor List: Figure\n\nFigure 3. Illustration of different effects of age and market capitalization on power-law exponents of cryptocurrencies.(a) Posterior probability distributions of the linear coefficients associated with the effects of age [p(A)] and (b) the effects of market capitalization [p(C)] on power-law exponents related to large positive returns. Panels (c) and (d) show the analogous distributions for the association with power-law exponents related to large negative returns. In all panels, the different curves show the distributions for each of the top 20 cryptoassets by market capitalization. Cryptocurrencies significantly affected by age or market capitalization are highlighted in boldface, and the numbers between brackets show their positions in the market capitalization rank. Figure S5.There is more probability mass in the positive tail than in the negative tail of price returns.(a) Probability distributions of the lower cut-offs (r min ) obtained by applying the Clauset-Shalizi-Newman method to positive (blue) and negative (red) returns. The vertical dashed lines indicate the median values of r min for positive and negative returns.(b) Probability distributions of 90th percentiles (r 90 ) estimated from the power-law models adjusted to positive (blue) and negative (red) returns. The vertical dashed lines indicate the median values of r 90 for positive and negative returns.(c) Probability distributions of the fraction of weeks that r 90 estimated from positive returns (r + 90 ) is larger than r 90 estimated from negative returns (r \u2212 90 ) .This fraction is calculated only for weeks in which the power-law hypothesis is not rejected for both tails. The percentage of cryptoassets for which r + 90 > r \u2212 90 is shown in the panels. The first column of panels depicts the results when considering data from all cryptocurrencies, while the second and third columns present the results for the top 2000 and top 200 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, respectively.",
      "Thus, there is no evidence of a unique overall pattern for the association between the power-law exponents and age or market capitalization followed by a significant part of the cryptocurrency market. Indeed, the 94% highest density intervals for \u03c3 A ([0.87, 0.93] for positive and [0.63, 0.70] for negative returns) and \u03c3 C ([0.57, 0.61] for positive and [0.49, 0.52] for negative returns) indicate that the cryptocurrency market is highly heterogeneous regarding the evolution of power-law exponents associated with large price variations (see Supplementary Figure for the distributions of \u03c3 A and \u03c3 C ). Figure illustrates these heterogeneous behaviors by plotting the posterior probability distributions for the linear coefficients associated with the effects of age (A) and market capitalization (C) for the top 20 digital assets, where cryptocurrencies which are significantly affected (that is, the 94% highest density intervals for A or C do not include the zero) by these quantities are highlighted in boldface. Even this small selection of digital  currencies already presents a myriad of patterns. First, we observe that the power-law exponents of a few top 20 cryptocurrencies are neither correlated with age nor market capitalization. That is the case of Shiba Inu (SHIB, rank 13) and Dai (DAI, rank 11) for both positive and negative returns, UNUS SED LEO (LEO, rank 18) and Polkadot (DOT, rank 12) for the positive returns, and USDCoin (USDC, rank 4) and Solana (SOL, rank 9) for negative returns. There are also cryptocurrencies with exponents positively or negatively correlated only with market capitalization. Examples include Tether (USDT, rank 3) and Dogecoin (DOGE, rank 10), for which the power-law exponents associated with positive returns increase with market capitalization, and Binance USD (BUSD, rank 6), for which power-law exponents associated with positive and negative returns decrease with market capitalization. We also observe cryptocurrencies for which age and market capitalization simultaneously affect the power-law exponents.",
      "Beyond the previous discussion about whether positive or negative returns are simultaneously or individually affected by age and market capitalization, we have also categorized the direction of the trend imposed by these two quantities on the power-law exponents. Blue rectangles in Fig. represent the fraction of relationships for which increasing age or market capitalization (or both) is associated with a raise in the power-law exponents. About 28% of all cryptocurrencies exhibit this pattern in which large price variations are expected to occur less frequently as they grow and age. Conversely, the red rectangles in Fig. depict the fraction of relationships for which increasing age or market capitalization (or both) is associated with a reduction in the power-law exponents. This case comprises about 25% of all cryptocurrencies for which large price variations are likely to become more frequent as they grow in market capitalization and age. Still, the majority of associations represented by green rectangles refer to the case where the effects of age and market capitalization point in different directions (e.g. exponents increasing with age while decreasing with market capitalization). About 36% of cryptocurrencies fit this condition which in turn contributes to consolidating the cumbersome hierarchical structure of patterns displayed by cryptocurrencies regarding the dynamics of large price variations. This complex picture is not much different when considering only cryptocurrencies in the top 200 market capitalization rank (Supplementary Figure ). However, we do observe an increased prevalence of patterns characterized by exponents that rise with age and market capitalization (37%), suggesting that large price variations are becoming less frequent among the top 200 cryptocurrencies than in the overall market.\n). Each of the previous three levels is further classified regarding whether both positive and negative returns are simultaneously affected or whether the effect involves only positive or only negative returns.",
      "Using a hierarchical Bayesian linear model, we have also simultaneously investigated the overall market characteristics and asset-specific tendencies regarding the effects of age and market capitalization on the power-law exponents. We have found that the cryptocurrency market is highly heterogeneous regarding the trends exhibited by each cryptocurrency; however, only a small fraction of cryptocurrencies (10%) have power-law exponents neither correlated with age nor market capitalization. These associations have been mostly ignored by the current literature and are probably related to the still-early developmental stage of the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Overall, 36% of cryptocurrencies present trends that do not systematically contribute to increasing or decreasing their power-law exponents as they age and grow in market capitalization. On the other hand, for 26% of cryptocurrencies, aging and growing market capitalization are both associated with a reduction in their power-law exponents, thus contributing to the rise in the frequency of large price variations in their dynamics. Only about 28% of cryptocurrencies present trends in which the power-law exponents increase with age and market capitalization, favoring thus large price variations to become less likely. These results somehow juxtapose with findings about the increasing informational efficiency of the cryptocurrency market . In fact, if on the one hand the cryptocurrency market is becoming more informationally efficient, then on the other our findings indicate that there is no clear trend toward decreasing the risks of sizable variations in the prices of most considered cryptoassets. In other words, risk and efficiency thus appear to be moving towards different directions in the cryptocurrency market. To conclude, we hope that our findings will contribute significantly to the better understanding of the dynamics of large price variations in the cryptocurrency market as a whole, and not just for a small subset of selected digital assets, which is especially relevant due to the diminishing concentration of market capitalization among the top digital currencies, and also because of the considerable impact these new assets may have in our increasingly digital economy.",
      "Polygon (MATIC, rank 14) is an example where the power-law exponents associated with positive returns tend to increase with age and decrease with market capitalization. Finally, there are also cryptocurrencies with power-law exponents only associated with age. That is the case of Bitcoin (BTC, rank 1), Ethereum (ETH, rank 2), and Cardano (ADA, rank 8), for which the power-law exponents related to positive and negative returns increase with age, but also the case of Uniswap (UNI, rank 19), for which the exponents decrease with age. Figure systematically extends the observations made for the top 20 cryptoassets to all 2140 digital currencies for which we have modeled the changes in the power-law exponents as a function of age and market capitalization. First, we note that only 10% of cryptocurrencies have power-law exponents not significantly affected by age and market capitalization. The vast majority (90%) displays some relationship with these quantities. However, these associations are as varied as the ones we have observed for the top 20 cryptoassets. About 52% of cryptocurrencies have power-law exponents simultaneously affected by age and market capitalization. In this group, these quantities simultaneously impact the exponents related to positive and negative returns of 34% of cryptoassets, whereas the remainder is affected only in the positive tail (9%) or only in the negative tail (9%). Moving back in the hierarchy, we find that the power-law exponents of 32% of cryptocurrencies are affected only by age while a much minor fraction (6%) is affected only by market capitalization. Within the group only affected by age, we observe that the effects are slightly more frequent only on the exponents related to negative returns (12%), compared to cases where effects are restricted only to positive returns (10%) or simultaneously affect both tails (10%). Finally, within the minor group only affected by market capitalization, we note that associations more frequently involve only exponents related to negative returns (3%) compared to the other two cases (2% only positive returns and 1% for both positive and negative returns)."

      "I know this article is narrowly focused on the hardware, but MS and Intel getting into hardware, Amazon getting into hardware, Google buying Moto, this is all vertical integration. How can you support the idea that this trend will be reversed with no real justification? I'm sure mobile chips will continue to specialize, but I don't think this means what you think it means. Automobile companies started making their own engines and with rare exceptions, never went back to being more horizontal. Same with retail and their store brands. Same with cloud companies and their servers. Same with mobile companies and their OSs. The horizontal market of PCs created by long-lasting standards and loose hegemony is the exception, not the norm. Why wouldn't the foundries be able close the process gap with Intel? Is it a matter of money? Scale? I'm not so sure about several things:1- Moore's law's relevance. Moore's Law is about ICs. ICs are not as big a part of mobile computers as they are of desktops, even of laptops: screens, batteries, radios are a huge part of tablets' and phones' costs, as opposed to the bare SoC + RAM.2- The tablet vs phone dichotomy. For some reason (probably price insensitivity due to subsidies), Phones have a tendency to be more powerful than Tablets, ie phone SoCs are more than good enough for tablets. Since the OS and peripherals are the same, it makes more sense to design and build just one type of SoC, and just disable the phone-modem part of it (even the other radios are still required: BT, Wifi, GPS...), same as Intel disable cache and cores for their entry-level CPUs. Once you're fabbing a SoC, it makes more sense to make more of the same than to setup a separate run of a cut-down SoC on an older process, unless volumes are huge. We might still be getting previous-generation, well amortized SoCs in cheaper tablets, though.3- On the contrary, I see a tablet and phone convergence (the ugly phablet). I'm patiently waiting for the new 6\"+ phones to replace my Nook Color and Galaxy Note 1 with a single device.4- The advantage of diversity ?",
      "The industry simply would not exist TODAY without the overwhelming horizontal integration that already dominates. Quote: In the long term, mobile devices are likely to evolve similarly to the PC and favor a horizontal business model. The real advantage is one of flexibility; as costs drop and the market expands, it will be increasingly necessary for vendors like HTC to offer a wide range of phones based on radically different SoCs. You don't mention in the article that each SoC necessarily requires a bit of parallel dev work unlike the PC. In the PC world there is a standard BIOS and HW architecture that allows for pluggable designs. On a highly integrated SoC this is untrue. HTC suffers because it has to support radically different SoCs, their drivers and boot loaders, etc. Quote:While a vertically integrated company like Apple can focus and maintain leadership in a specific (and highly lucrative) niche, it would be very difficult to expand in many growing areas of the market. The differences between an iPhone 6 and a $20 feature phone are tremendous and would be very difficult for a single company to bridge. It's only difficult because Apple chooses to ignore that market, not because they can't. If they can release a $99 Apple TV, they can surely cobble together a $20 feature phone if they chose to eschew 8GB of NAND, BT, WiFi, a specialized dock connector, LTE, and their specialized processors. In other words, build the equivalent of an iPod shuffle with a horrible screen and no OS to speak of. paul5ra wrote:melgross wrote:paul5ra wrote:As someone who has worked in the semiconductor industry for longer than contemporary fanboys have existed, I'm getting a bit fed-up seeing many of these articles which rewrite history with analyses distorted by the lens of the contemporary Apple or Samsung fanboy.

Yeah, and most of the innovation in the automobile industry came about before Henry Ford came into the business.

      "Each of those manufacturers knew that smartphones would eventually be awesome, but none of them had the UI and software design to make a truly breakout product. Imagine if Motorola would have been smart enough to buy the Android guys instead of Google. Instead, Google bought a bunch of patents on that cellular black box to try to defend it's platform. And when you think about it, which consumes more man years of engineering effort per year at this point.... iterating that cellular black box or developing the OS, services and apps that power today's smartphones?\nIntel had better decide that they are competing in this space \"for real\", or they are screwed. They've already let the Atom languish for five years, during which ARM has completely caught up in performance. Just like Tim Cook said, if you don't cannibalize your own markets someone else will do it for you. Whether Intel will embrace that concept in time remains to be seen. Personally, I hope they don't; if Intel transforms into a chipless Fab company (like TSMC) everyone benefits. I still think Samsung has the advantage long term because they have both the SOC and the memory products. As mentioned in the article, TSV's (Through Silicon Via's) are going to be quite a disruption. Today, people normally stack an LPDDR2 package on top of their SOC package (POP or Package On Package). Within the LPDDR2 package, you could have a stack of DRAM die typically with wire bonding connecting the die within the package. Once you more to TSV's, you can have a LOT more connections between the SOC and its DRAM's. While this is being standardized through JEDEC (http://www.jedec.org/category/technolog ... a/3d-ics-0), Samsung has all the pieces in house to do whatever they want. You could see a 512 bit or higher bus from the SOC to the memory. The trick is that the memory and the SOC need to line up with each other when you stack them. This gives Samsung an inherent advantage. This isn't just going to impact mobile either. Take a look at that JEDEC link."

      "The three top-ranking teams (Lasa, Gitastrophe, and Shadoks) on the CG:SHOP 2022 challenge all used a common approach called conflict optimization while the fourth team used a SAT-Boosted Tabu Search . Conflict optimization is a technique used by Shadoks to obtain the first place in the CG:SHOP 2021 challenge for low-makespan coordinated motion planning , and the main ideas of the technique lent themselves well to the 2022 challenge. Next, we describe the conflict optimizer as a metaheuristic to solve constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) . We start by describing a CSP. A CSP is a triple of \u2022 variables X = (x 1 , . . . , x n ), Each of the 57 colors is then presented in small figures. \u2022 domains D = (D 1 , . . . , D n ), and \u2022 constraints R. Each variable x i must be assigned a value in the corresponding domain D i such that all constraints are satisfied. In general, the constraints may forbid arbitrary subsets of values. We restrict our attention to a particular type of constraints (binary CSP ), which only involve pairs of assignments. A partial evaluation is an assignment of a subset of the variables, called evaluated, with the remaining variables called non-evaluated. All constraints involving a non-evaluated variable are satisfied by default. We only consider assignments and partial assignments that satisfy all constraints. The conflict optimizer iteratively modifies a partial evaluation with the goal of emptying the set S of non-evaluated variables, at which point it stops. At each step, a variable x i is removed from S. If there exists a value x \u2208 D i that satisfies all constraints, then we assign the value x to the variable x i . Otherwise, we proceed as follows. For each possible value x \u2208 D i , we consider the set K(i, x) of variables (other than x i ) that are part of constraints violated by the assignment x i = x.\nWe assign to x i the value x that minimizes where w(j) is a weight function to be described later. The variables x j \u2208 K(i, x) become non-evaluated and added to S. The weight function should be such that w(j) increases each time x j is added to S, in order to avoid loops that keep moving the same variables back and forth from S. Let q(j) be the number of times x j became non-evaluated.",
      "Removing the easy vertices reduces the total number of vertices, making the conflict optimizer more effective. The Shadoks always toggle this option on (the challenge instances contain from 0 to 23% easy vertices). Results\n\nWe provide the results of the experiments performed with the code from the three teams on two classes of instances. First, we present the results on some selected CG:SHOP 2022 instances. These instances are intersection graphs of line segments. Second, we execute the code on graphs that are not intersection graphs, namely the classic DIMACS graphs , comparing the results of our conflict optimizer implementations to previous solutions. The source code for the three teams is available at: \u2022 Lasa: https://github.com/librallu/dogs-color \u2022 Gitastrophe: https://github.com/jacketsj/cgshop2022-gitastrophe \u2022 Shadoks: https://github.com/gfonsecabr/shadoks-CGSHOP2022\n\nCG:SHOP 2022 Instances\n\nWe selected 14 instances (out of 225) covering the different types of instances given in the CG:SHOP 2022 challenge. The results are presented in Table . For comparison, we executed the HEAD code on some instances using the default parameters. The table shows the smallest number of colors for which HEAD found a solution. We ran HEAD for 1 hour of repetitions for each target number of colors on a single CPU core (the HEAD solver takes the target number of colors as a parameter and we increased this parameter one by one). At the end of the challenge, 8 colorings computed by Lasa, 11 colorings computed by Gitastrophe, and 23 colorings computed by Shadoks over 225 instances have been proved optimal (their number of colors is equal to the size of a clique). In order to compare the efficiency of the algorithms, we executed the different implementations on the CG:SHOP instance vispecn13806. The edge density of this graph is 19%, the largest clique that we found has 177 vertices and the best coloring found during the challenge uses 218 colors. Notice that vispecn13806 is the same instance used in other Shadoks experiments in Section 5.",

Surprisingly, the top three teams used the same technique, called conflict optimization. This technique has been introduced in the 2021 edition of the challenge, to solve a coordinated motion planning problem. In this paper, we present the technique in the more general framework of binary constraint satisfaction problems (binary CSP). Then, the top three teams describe their different implementations of the same underlying strategy. We evaluate the performance of those implementations to vertex color not only geometric graphs, but also other types of graphs. Introduction\n\nThe CG:SHOP challenge (Computational Geometry: Solving Hard Optimization Problems) is an annual geometric optimization competition, whose first edition took place in 2019. The 2022 edition proposed a problem called minimum partition into plane subgraphs. The input is a graph G embedded in the plane with edges drawn as straight line segments, and the goal is to partition the set of edges into a small number of plane graphs (Fig. ) . This goal can be formulated as a vertex coloring problem on a graph G defined as follows. The vertices of G are the segments defining the edges of G, and the edges of G correspond to pairs of crossing segments (segments that intersect only at a common endpoint are not considered crossing).",
      "This neighbourhood was also introduced alongside a tabu-search procedure. The tabu-search scheme is also replaced by a conflict-optimization scheme. Note that this neighbourhood was predominantly used by the other teams. Finding Initial Solutions\n\nLasa team used two approaches to find initial solutions: 1. DSATUR is the classical graph coloring algorithm presented in Section 1. 2. Orientation greedy is almost the only algorithm where the geometry of the segments is used. If segments are almost parallel, it is likely that they do not intersect (thus forming an independent set). This greedy algorithm first sorts the segments by orientation, ranging from \u2212 \u03c0 2 to \u03c0 2 . For each segment in this order, the algorithm tries to color it using the first available color. If no color has been found, a new color is created for coloring the considered segment. This algorithm is efficient, produces interesting initial solutions and takes into account the specificities of the competition. Solution Initialization\n\nThe gitastrophe team uses the traditional greedy algorithm of Welsh and Powell to obtain initial solutions: order the vertices in decreasing order of degree, and assign each vertex the minimum-label color not used by its neighbors. During the challenge Gitastrophe attempted to use different orderings for the greedy algorithm, such as sorting by the slope of the line segment associated with each vertex (as the orientation greedy initialization presented in Section 3), and also tried numerous other strategies. Ultimately, after running the solution optimizer for approximately the same amount of time, all initializations resulted in an equal number of colors. Modifications to the Conflict Optimizer\n\nTaking inspiration from memetic algorithms, which alternate between an intensification and a diversification stage, the algorithm continually switched between a phase using the above conflict score, and one minimizing only the number of conflicts. Thus during the conflict-minimization phase, the random variables f (C j ) and w(u) are both fixed equal to 1 leading to a conflict score\nEach phase lasted for 10 5 iterations.",
      "Adding the conflict-minimization phase gave minor improvements to some of the challenge instances. Shadoks\n\nIn this section, we describe the choices used by the Shadoks team for the options described in Section 2.1. The Shadoks generally chose to eliminate the color with the smallest number of elements. However, if the multistart option is toggled on, then a random color is used each time. The conflict set S is stored in a queue. The Shadoks tried other strategies, but found that the queue gives the best results. The weight function used is w(u) = 1 + q(u) p , mostly with p = 1.2. The effect of the parameter p is shown in Fig. . Notice that in all figures, the number of colors shown is the average of ten executions of the code using different random seeds. The algorithm uses \u03c3 = 0.15, easy vertices, q max = 59022, but does not use the BDFS nor any clique. If q(u) is larger than a threshold q max , the Shadoks set w(u) = \u221e so that the vertex u never reenters S. If at some point an uncolored vertex v is adjacent to some vertex u of infinite weight in every color class, then the conflict optimizer is restarted. When restarting, the initial coloring is shuffled by moving some vertices from their initial color class to a new one. Looking at Fig. , the value of q max does not seem to have much influence as long as it is not too small. Throughout the challenge the Shadoks almost exclusively used q max = 2000 \u2022 (75000/m) 2 , where m is the number of vertices. This value roughly ensures a restart every few hours. q max =0.5k q max =5k q max =50k q max =100k q max =250k The Shadoks use the function f as a Gaussian random variable of mean 1 and variance \u03c3. A good default value is \u03c3 = 0.15. The effect of the variance is shown in Fig. . Notice that setting \u03c3 = 0 gives much worse results. Option (e) The goal of BDFS is to further optimize very good solutions that the conflict optimizer is not able to improve otherwise. Fig. shows the influence of BDFS. While on this figure, the advantages of BDFS cannot be noticed, its use near the end of the challenge improved about 30 solutions."

In our work, the spectral density estimator f is based on the gamma distributed data W i,1 , . . . , W i,p , which are only asymptotically independent. Moreover, the mean of these data is not exactly f (\u03c0x 1 ), . . . , f (\u03c0x p ), but is corrupted by the diagonalization error given in Lemma 1. This error adds to the error that arises via binning and VST and that describes the deviation from a Gaussian distribution, as derived in .

Moreover, the decay of the autocovariance \u03c3 k is directly connected to the smoothness of f .

      "The parameter k can then be chosen by cross-validation as above. We employ this approach under scenario (A) instead of an unavailable fully data-driven criterion and name it semi-oracle.

To illustrate the goodness-of-fit of the spectral density, the L 2 norm f \u2212 f 2 is also computed. The results show that the tapering and VST-DCT estimator perform overall similar in terms of the spectral norm risk. This is not surprising as both estimators are proved to be rate-optimal. Moreover, both the tapering and VST-DCT estimators are clearly superior to the inconsistent sample Toeplitz covariance matrix. A closer look at the numbers shows that the VST-DCT method has better constants, i.e., VST-DCT estimators have somewhat smaller errors in the spectral norm than the tapering estimators across all examples, but especially under scenario (C). The oracle estimators show similar behaviour, but are slightly less variable compared to the data-driven estimators. In general, both the tapering and VST-DCT estimators perform best for example 1, second best for example 3 and worst for example 2, which traces back to functions complexity. In terms of computational time, both methods are similarly fast for scenarios (A) and (B). For scenario (C), the tapering method is much slower due to the multiple high-dimensional matrix multiplications in the cross-validation method. It is expected that for larger p the tapering estimator is much more computationally intensive than the corresponding VST-DCT estimator."

      "Therefore, we suggest an alternative approach that allows the spectral density to be estimated as a mean in an approximate Gaussian regression. Such estimators have a closed-form expression, do not require an iterative optimization algorithm and a smoothing parameter can be easily obtained with any conventional criterion. First Hence, for W j = (D t j Y ) 2 , j = 1, . . . , p it follows with Lemma 1 that where \u0393(a, b) denotes a gamma distribution with a shape parameter a and a scale parameter b. Note that the random variables W 1 , . . . , W p are only asymptotically independent. Obviously, E(W j ) = f (\u03c0x j ) + O(1), j = 1, . . .\n, p. To estimate f from W 1 , . . . , W p , one could use a generalized nonparametric regression framework with a gamma distributed response, see e.g., the classical monograph by . However, this approach requires an iterative procedure for estimation, e.g., a Newton-Raphson algorithm, with a suitable choice for the smoothing parameter at each iteration step. Deriving the L \u221e rate for the resulting estimator is also not a trivial task. Instead, we suggest to employ a variance stabilizing transform of that converts the gamma regression into an approximate Gaussian regression. In the next section we present the methodology in more detail for a general setting with n \u2265 1. Methodology\n\nFor Y i \u223c N p (0 p , \u03a3), i = 1, . . . , n, it was shown in the previous section that with Lemma 1 the data can be transformed into gamma distributed random variables . . , n, j = 1, . . . , p, where for each fixed i the random variable W i,j has the same distribution as W j given in (3). Now the approach of Cai et al. ( ) is adapted to the setting n \u2265 1. First, the transformed data points W i,j are binned, that is, fewer new variables . . , T . Note that the number of observations in a bin is m = np/T . In Theorem 1 in Section 4, we show that setting T = p \u03c5 for any \u03c5 \u2208 ((4 \u2212 2 min{\u03b2, 1})/3, 1) leads to the minimax optimal rate for the spectral density estimator. To simplify the notation, m is handled as an integer (otherwise, one can discard several observations in the last bin).",
      "In fact, our numerical experiments have even shown that if the spectral density is estimated from W j = f (\u03c0x j ) + j , that is, as if W j were Gaussian instead of gamma distributed, then the resulting spectral density estimator has almost the same L \u221e risk (and hence the corresponding covariance matrix has almost the same spectral norm). Of course, such an estimator would lead to a wrong inference about f (\u03c0x j ), since the growing variance of W j would be ignored. Since our approach translates Toeplitz covariance matrix estimation into a mean estimation in an approximate Gaussian nonparametric regression, all approaches developed in the context of Gaussian nonparametric regression, such as (locally)\nadaptive estimation, as well as the corresponding (simultaneous) inference, can be directly applied. Bayesian tools for adaptive estimation and inference in Gaussian nonparametric regression as proposed in can also be employed. Appendix\n\nThroughout the appendix, we denote by c, c 1 , C, C 1 , . . . etc. generic constants, that are independent of n and p. To simplify the notation, the constants are sometimes skipped and we write for less than or equal to up to constants. We embed the p-dimensional Toeplitz matrix \u03a3 = toep(\u03c3 0 , . . . , \u03c3 p\u22121 ) in a (2p \u2212 2)dimensional circulant matrix \u03a3 = toep(\u03c3 0 , . . .\n, \u03c3 p\u22121 , \u03c3 p\u22122 , . . . , \u03c3 1 ).

In particular, b(j, r) = b(j, 2p\u2212r) and c(j, r) = \u2212c(j, 2p\u2212r) for r = p+1, . . .\n, 2p\u22122. Together, we have (A.1) Some calculations show that for r = 1, . . . p Using the Taylor expansion of cot(x) for 0 < |x| < \u03c0 one obtains for r = 1, . . . p where the O term does not depend on j and the hidden constant does not depend on r, p. If i = j, equations (A.1) -(A.3) imply where the O terms do not depend on j.\nSince the complex exponential function is Lipschitz continuous with constant L = 1, it holds \u03bb r = \u03bb j + L r,j |r \u2212 j|p \u22121 where \u22121 \u2264 L r,j \u2264 1 is a constant depending on r,",
      "However, it turns out that the right choice of the subseries length is crucial for this approach, but there is no data-based method available for this. In this work, an alternative way to estimate a Toeplitz covariance matrix and its inverse is chosen. Our approach exploits the one-to-one correspondence between Toeplitz covariance matrices and their spectral densities. First, the given data are transformed into approximate Gaussian random variables whose mean equals to the logarithm of the spectral density. Then, the log-spectral density is estimated by a periodic smoothing spline with a data-driven smoothing parameter. Finally, the resulting spectral density estimator is transformed into an estimator for \u03a3 or its inverse. It is shown that this procedure leads to an estimator that is fully data-driven, automatically positive definite and achieves the minimax optimal convergence rate under the spectral norm over a large class of Toeplitz covariance matrices. In particular, this class includes Toeplitz covariance matrices that correspond to long-memory processes with bounded spectral densities. Moreover, the computation is very efficient, does not require iterative or resampling schemes and allows to apply any inference and adaptive estimation procedures developed in the context of nonparametric Gaussian regression. Estimation of the spectral density from a stationary time series is a research topic with a long history. Earlier nonparametric methods are based on smoothing of the (log-)periodogram, which itself is not a consistent estimator . Another line of nonparametric methods for estimating the spectral density is based on the Whittle likelihood, which is an ap-proximation to the exact likelihood of the time series in the frequency domain. For example, estimated the spectral density from a penalized Whittle likelihood, while used polynomial splines to estimate the log-spectral density function maximizing the Whittle likelihood. Recently, Bayesian methods for spectral density estimation have been proposed (see , but these may become very computationally intensive in large samples due to posterior sampling.",
      "The proof can be found in Appendix A.1. This result shows that the DCT-I matrix approximately diagonalizes Toeplitz covariance matrices and that the diagonalization error depends to some extent on the smoothness of the corresponding spectral density. In the spectral density literature the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix\n, where i is the imaginary unit, is typically employed to approximately diagonalize Toeplitz covariance matrices. Using the fact that introduced an approximation for the likelihood of a single Gaussian stationary time series (case n = 1), the so-called Whittle likelihood (1) The quantity , where F j denotes the j-th column of F , is known as the periodogram at the j-th Fourier frequency. Note that due to periodogram symmetry, only p/2 data points I 1 , ..., I p/2 are available for estimating the mean f (2\u03c0j/p), j = 1, . . . , p/2 , where x denotes the largest integer strictly smaller than x. The Whittle likelihood has become a popular tool for parameter estimation of stationary time series, e.g., for nonparametric and parametric spectral density estimation or for estimation of the Hurst exponent, see e.g., ; . Lemma 1 yields the following alternative version of the Whittle likelihood where W j = (D t j Y ) 2 . Note that this likelihood approximation is based on twice as many data points W j as the standard Whittle likelihood. Thus, it allows for a more efficient use of the data Y to estimate the parameter of interest, such as the spectral density or the Hurst parameter. Equations ( ) or (2) invite for the estimation of f by maximizing the (penalized) likelihood over certain linear spaces (e.g., spline spaces), as suggested e.g., in or . However, such an approach requires well-designed numerical methods to solve the corresponding optimization problem, since the spectral density in the second term of (1) or ( ) is in the denominator, which does not allow to obtain a closed-form expression for the estimator and often leads to numerical instabilities. Also, the choice of the smoothing parameter becomes challenging.",
      "Next, applying the variance stabilizing transform (VST) \u223c where H(y) = {\u03c6(m/2) + log (2y/m)} / \u221a 2 and \u03c6 is the digamma function (see . Now, the scaled and shifted log-spectral density H(f ) can be estimated with a periodic smoothing spline\nwhere h > 0 denotes a smoothing parameter, q \u2208 N is the penalty order and S per (2q \u2212 1) a space of periodic splines of degree 2q \u2212 1. The smoothing parameter h can be chosen either with generalized cross-validation (GCV) as derived in or with the restricted maximum likelihood, see . Once an estimator H(f ) is obtained, application of the inverse transform function H \u22121 (y) = m exp \u221a 2y \u2212 \u03c6 (m/2) /2 yields the spectral density estimator f = H \u22121 H(f ) . Finally, using the inverse Fourier transform leads to the fol- The precision matrix \u2126 is estimated by the inverse Fourier transform of the reciprocal of the spectral density estimator, i.e., \u03a9 = (\u03c9 |i\u2212j| ) p i,j=1 with \u03c9k = The estimation procedure for \u03a3 and \u03a9 can be summarised as follows. 1. Data Transformation:\nwhere D is the (p \u00d7 p)-dimensional DCT-I matrix as given in Lemma 1 and D j is its j-th column. 2. Binning: Set T = p \u03c5 for any \u03c5 \u2208 ((4 \u2212 2 min{\u03b2, 1})/3, 1) and calculate W i,j , k = 1, . . . , T.\n\nVST:\n\nwhere k are asymptotically i.i.d. Gaussian variables. Inverse VST: Estimate the spectral density f with f = H \u22121 H(f ) , where Note that \u03a3 and \u03a9 are positive definite matrices by construction, since their spectral density functions f and f \u22121 are non-negative, respectively. Unlike the banding and tapering estimators, the autocovariance estimators \u03c3k are controlled by a single smoothing parameter h, which can be estimated fully data-driven with several available automatic methods, which are numerically efficient and well-studied. In addition, one can also use methods for adaptive mean estimation, see e.g., , which in turn leads to adaptive Toeplitz covariance matrix estimation. All inferential procedures developed in the Gaussian regression context can also be adopted accordingly. Theoretical Properties\n\nIn this section, we study the asymptotic properties of the estimators f , \u03a3 and \u03a9."

      "This \\emph{motion artifact} can be the prime cause of signal contamination of physiological outcomes while performing daily activities which must be removed. \\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposes an EDA sensor signal processing method consists of three steps: (i) noise and motion artifacts removal, (ii) separation of tonic component and phasic component (explained later) from contamination free EDA signal and (iii) feature extraction on the response window. \\subsubsection{Motion Artifacts Removal} There are many types of motion artifacts but the unsual steep rise is the mostly occured ones associated with EDA signal while performing daily activities \\cite{edel67}. We use well-known steep rising noises reduction technique, SWT \\cite{chen15}. We first consider EDA signal as a mixture of a slow variant tonic and fast variant phasic component, i.e., SWT coefficient is modeled as a mixture of two Gaussian components, phasic (close to zero valued signal) and tonic (high rising signal). After expanding EDA signal into multiple levels of scaling and wavelet coefficients, we choose adaptively a threshold limit at each level based on the statistical estimation of the wavelet coefficients' distribution, and employ that on the wavelet coefficients of all levels. Finally, an inverse wavelet transform technique is applied to the thresholded wavelet coefficients to obtain the artifacts free EDA signal. Fig~.\\ref{fig:eda_artifact_removal} shows a sample of raw and motion artifacts free EDA signal. \\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\begin{center}\n\\vspace{-.1in}\n   \\epsfig{file=eda_signal_artifact.pdf,height=1.6in, width=3.5in}\n\\caption{Dashed line represents noisy EDA signal and solid red line represents \\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposed motion artifact free EDA signal}\n   \\label{fig:eda_artifact_removal}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\\subsubsection{Convex Optimization Technique to EDA Deconvolution} After the motion artifact removal, we consider EDA as the sum of three components for $N$ sample: a slow tonic driver ($t$), fast (compact, bursty) non-negative sparse phasic driver ($r$) and a reminder error term ($\\epsilon_r$).",
      "In \\emph{observation based activity features}, we design a complex activity set comprised of multiple subtasks which are involved with task {\\it interruption, completion and sequencing}. Participants are instructed to perform the complex activities while the trained evaluator observed the aforementioned functional activity performance measures. Each incorrect attempt of performance measure will be assigned one point thus higher score reflects lower performance of functional activities \\cite{dawadi14}. We first detect hand gesture and postural activities. Then, we feed the low-level activity contexts (gestural and postural) combined with ambient contexts (object and ambient motion sensor readings) into HDBN for single inhabitant model \\cite{alam16b} to recognize complex activities. The complex activity recognition framework provides both activity labels and activity window (start-end points). Then, we extract features of object sensor, ambient sensor, gestural activity and postural activity events for each activity window. The features are number of occurrences, mean number of occurrences, consecutive 1, 2, 3, $\\ldots$ 20 occurrences, top 10, 20, 30, $\\ldots$, 90 percentile etc (29 features in total). In \\emph{physiological features} we first detect 13 complex activities using HDBN algorithm which provides activity labels and activity window (start-end points), apply noise reduction, motion artifacts removal, extract 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features for each activity and take the mean of them over time (minutes) to get 15 (7+8) complex activity physiological features set for each participant. In summary, we extract 3 observation based activity features, 29 automatic activity performance features, 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features.\n\\subsection{Physiological Signal Processing Performance Evaluation}\nStandard evaluation technique should use both experimental and publicly available datasets to confirm the outperformance of the novel approaches. We first evaluate our physiological signal processing techniques using a publicly available dataset (EES Dataset \\cite{picard01}) to detect 8 human emotions.",
      "Our final combined classifier (SMO based SVM algorithm \\cite{cao06}) provides an accuracy of {\\bf 93\\%} in detecting the cognitive impairment status of older adults. Fig. \\ref{fig:combined_classification} shows our proposed individual and combined methods outperform the baseline \\cite{alam16} significantly (13\\% improvement). Fig. \\ref{fig:each_activity_cognitive_assessment} shows the cognitive impairment status prediction accuracy for each modality (activity feature, EDA and HRV) per individual complex activity.\n\\subsection{Discussion}\nIf we exclude the postural activities from automated activity performance scoring, we find reduced statistical correlation with original task completeness performance for \\{NCI, MCI, CI\\} participant group (INT 0.53*, SEQ 0.21' and unsupervised 0.49'). However, if we skip our proposed motion artifact removal stage, we find reduced statistical correlation with \\{NCI, MCI\\} and \\{MCI, CI\\} groups of participants (EDA and HRV correlations respectively \\{0.51*, -0.51*\\} and \\{-0.53*,0.46\\}). To test our proposed motion artifacts removal impact on EDA signals more rigorously, we choose 5 random participants, engage one expert motion artifact annotator to annotate motion artifacts segment on each participant's first 30 minutes of complex dataset using recorded video and apply both baseline and our methods to detect motion artifact segments. While baseline method achieves 75.5\\% (FP rate 20.3\\%) accuracy in detecting motion artifact segments, \\emph{AutoCogniSys} outperforms achieving 89.9\\% (FP rate 8.9\\%) accuracy.

One truly believes in God but he is a bad husband and father who cheats on his wife and neglects his children. The other man is a nonbeliever; he accepts religion in theory and doctrine but simply does not have faith no matter how hard he tried. He is a good father and a good husband as well. When they stand before God at the Day of Judgment, would the nonbeliever be condemned to eternal hell only for that one flaw in him? Don't the other good traits in that person matter at all? Does being a nonbeliever equal being evil?\n2-God knows everything. However, why would He have created when He knows exactly what each person is going to do and where they will end up? For example, let us suppose that tomorrow I will murder someone. God knows that I will do that. And He knows that I will suffer in hell when the time comes. So why does He purposely inflict that pain on me? To teach me a lesson? He knows the outcome of everything and everyone He has created. 3-Since you brought up science in the previous comments section, I am seriously curious (I am not trying to be glib) about dinosaurs and prehistoric humans. We have seen the evolution of humans and we have fossils and hard evidence of it. The science world has traced back \"Eve\" to Africa. The concept of Adam and Eve seems too mythological to be 100% factual. It has the same tone of Greek and Ancient Egyptian legends. -Note: I am not trying to corner you here, I just want to know your response to my queries and thoughts.

      "It took a long time to get there. No, extreme depravity wasn\u2019t the result of the Fall, but total depravity still is. Total depravity is the doctrine that says sin bent every part of man. Sin pollutes man\u2019s reason, man\u2019s emotions, man\u2019s willpower, man\u2019s desires, man\u2019s imagination, man\u2019s memories, man\u2019s senses, man\u2019s body, and even man\u2019s conscience. Nothing is safe. Nothing is pure. And this is intimately wrapped up in the image of God. Remember that man was made in God\u2019s image, unique among all creation. But sin now pollutes that image. It\u2019s still present\u2014we still can\u2019t help but \u201cimage\u201d our Creator when we act rationally, make wise decisions, love others selflessly, and so on. Instead the image is defaced but not erased. What should normally reflect God\u2019s character instead reflects a mixture of good and evil. Comparing Theories\nNow if we take a step back, we all recognize that we live in a broken world. Very few people would argue that everything is perfect, that sin, suffering, and death somehow don\u2019t exist or aren\u2019t really bad. We (generally) all agree that there\u2019s a problem. But there\u2019s little agreement about why it is the way it is. People who don\u2019t believe in a literal Adam and Even tanking the human race are generally stuck. For example, if you only believe in the natural world, evil is just a part of nature. Death is a part of life. Suffering is a biochemical response to destructive conditions. And if you\u2019re just one organism out of millions competing for resources, all you can really say is that you don\u2019t like these things. They are distasteful. Maybe you\u2019re hard-wired to show empathy with others because of some evolutionary imperative, but objectively speaking what can you say? Well, you can say lots I suppose, but you can\u2019t be consistent without ending up a nihilist. Other religions have the same problem: either evil belongs as some part of the bigger cosmic plan or it\u2019s an illusion. Either way, it\u2019s hard to take evil seriously. Either it belongs in some way, or it doesn\u2019t exist at all.",

Of course, \"seeing\" means no such thing. \"Seeing\" means gathering data to construct a mental model of an external reality. We don't, in fact, \"see\" this inner model at all. This \"model\" is a product of speculation and abstraction in meta-conscious process of self-reflection. Yes, the view point is within the model. We don't literally 'see' across a room. The model gets 'viewed' and navigated and noted and whatnot. The outer reality is not able to be viewed directly but is usefully \"looked out at\" through a representation.

Your interpretations are based on your own presumptions which I reject as incorrect. The process of human intention and action is certainly a complex one but the fact remains that the first causes do exist. People may be capable of simply watching much of their life pass by as an minimally participating observer (with all sorts of fatalistic and compatibilist dodges and delusions of objectivity), but others choose to take ownership of the first causes within them as a fully responsible participants in their own life. Total libertarians do claim that they are first cause, self made people at every instant."

      "Therefore, an accurate estimator of this quantity is crucial for the interpretation of the results and can only be achieved if the dependence in the data is taken into account. Estimating \u03a3 with a tapered covariance estimator has two practical problems. First, since we only have a single realization of a time series Y (n = 1), there is no datadriven method for selecting the tapering parameter. Second, the tapering estimator turned out not to be positive definite for the data at hand. To solve the second problem, we truncated the corresponding spectral density estimator ftap to a small positive value, i.e., f + tap = max{ ftap , 1/ log(p)} (see . To select the tapering parameter with cross-validation, we experimented with different subseries lengths and found that the tapering estimator is very sensitive to this choice. For example, estimating the tapered covariance matrix based on subseries of length 8/15/30 yields a correlation of 0.42/0.53/0.34 between the true diameter and the first PLS component, respectively. Altogether, our proposed estimator is fully data-driven, fast even for large sample sizes, automatically positive definite and can handle certain long-memory processes. In contrast, the tapering estimator is not data-driven and must be manipulated to become positive definite. Our method is implemented in the R package vstdct. Discussion\n\nIn this paper, we proposed a simple, fast, fully data-driven, automatically positive definite and minimax optimal estimator of Toeplitz covariance matrices from a large class that also includes covariance matrices of certain long-memory processes. Our estimator is derived under the assumption that the data are Gaussian. However, simulations show that the suggested approach yields robust estimators even when the data are not normally distributed. In the context of spectral density estima- , for mixing processes (see Theorem 5.3 of Rosenblatt, 2012), as well as for non-linear processes (see . Since DFT and DCT matrices are closely related, we expect that equation (3) also holds asymptotically for these non-Gaussian time series, but consider a rigorous analysis to be beyond the scope of this paper.",
      "However, it turns out that the right choice of the subseries length is crucial for this approach, but there is no data-based method available for this. In this work, an alternative way to estimate a Toeplitz covariance matrix and its inverse is chosen. Our approach exploits the one-to-one correspondence between Toeplitz covariance matrices and their spectral densities. First, the given data are transformed into approximate Gaussian random variables whose mean equals to the logarithm of the spectral density. Then, the log-spectral density is estimated by a periodic smoothing spline with a data-driven smoothing parameter. Finally, the resulting spectral density estimator is transformed into an estimator for \u03a3 or its inverse. It is shown that this procedure leads to an estimator that is fully data-driven, automatically positive definite and achieves the minimax optimal convergence rate under the spectral norm over a large class of Toeplitz covariance matrices. In particular, this class includes Toeplitz covariance matrices that correspond to long-memory processes with bounded spectral densities. Moreover, the computation is very efficient, does not require iterative or resampling schemes and allows to apply any inference and adaptive estimation procedures developed in the context of nonparametric Gaussian regression. Estimation of the spectral density from a stationary time series is a research topic with a long history. Earlier nonparametric methods are based on smoothing of the (log-)periodogram, which itself is not a consistent estimator . Another line of nonparametric methods for estimating the spectral density is based on the Whittle likelihood, which is an ap-proximation to the exact likelihood of the time series in the frequency domain. For example, estimated the spectral density from a penalized Whittle likelihood, while used polynomial splines to estimate the log-spectral density function maximizing the Whittle likelihood. Recently, Bayesian methods for spectral density estimation have been proposed (see , but these may become very computationally intensive in large samples due to posterior sampling.",

      "The parameter k can then be chosen by cross-validation as above. We employ this approach under scenario (A) instead of an unavailable fully data-driven criterion and name it semi-oracle. Finally, for all three scenarios (A), (B) and (C), the oracle tapering parameter is computed using grid search for each Monte Carlo sample as kor = arg min k=2,3,...,p/2 T ap k ( \u03a3) \u2212 \u03a3 , where \u03a3 is the sample covariance matrix. To speed up the computation, one can replace the spectral norm by the 1 norm, as suggested by . In Tables , the errors of the Toeplitz covariance estimators with respect to the spectral norm and the computation time for one Monte Carlo iteration are given for scenarios (A), (B) and (C), respectively. To illustrate the goodness-of-fit of the spectral density, the L 2 norm f \u2212 f 2 is also computed. The results show that the tapering and VST-DCT estimator perform overall similar in terms of the spectral norm risk. This is not surprising as both estimators are proved to be rate-optimal. Moreover, both the tapering and VST-DCT estimators are clearly superior to the inconsistent sample Toeplitz covariance matrix. A closer look at the numbers shows that the VST-DCT method has better constants, i.e., VST-DCT estimators have somewhat smaller errors in the spectral norm than the tapering estimators across all examples, but especially under scenario (C). The oracle estimators show similar behaviour, but are slightly less variable compared to the data-driven estimators. In general, both the tapering and VST-DCT estimators perform best for example 1, second best for example 3 and worst for example 2, which traces back to functions complexity. In terms of computational time, both methods are similarly fast for scenarios (A) and (B). For scenario (C), the tapering method is much slower due to the multiple high-dimensional matrix multiplications in the cross-validation method. It is expected that for larger p the tapering estimator is much more computationally intensive than the corresponding VST-DCT estimator.",

This estimator is based on a data transformation that translates the problem of Toeplitz covariance matrix estimation to the problem of mean estimation in an approximate Gaussian regression. The resulting Toeplitz covariance matrix estimator is positive definite by construction, fully data-driven and computationally very fast. Moreover, this estimator is shown to be minimax optimal under the spectral norm for a large class of Toeplitz matrices. These results are readily extended to estimation of inverses of Toeplitz covariance matrices. Also, an alternative version of the Whittle likelihood for the spectral density based on the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is proposed. The method is implemented in the R package vstdct that accompanies the paper.

      "Analogously, we can optimize the channels exactly at some classically tractable size and then execute them on a quantum processor with larger size.

For large noise strengths, we generally see that the optimization of the denoiser becomes difficult, leading to nonmonotonic behavior as a function of p, presumably because we do not find the global optimum of the denoiser. It is interesting to analyze the spectra of the supercircuits considered in this work. As mentioned in the main text, the spectrum of the ideal, unitary supercircuit C lies on the unit circle. The comparison to this case is therefore instructive. In the main text, we showed an example of the spectra in Fig. for moderate noise strength. Here, we show additional data for stronger noise p = 0.036 in Fig. for a denoiser with M = 4 layers, optimized to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuit with M trot = 16 layers at time t = 1.

We first execute the targeted noisy circuit completely, letting the noise propagate and accumulate, and only afterwards we apply an extra random circuit sampled from a quasiprobability distribution.

      "\\subsection{FPSA: Fokker-Planck Synthetic Acceleration}\\label{FPSA}\n\nIn the FPSA scheme \\cite{JapanFPSA,japanDiss}, the FP approximation is used as a preconditioner to synthetically accelerate convergence when solving \\cref{transport1} (cf. \\cite{adamslarsen} for a detailed description of synthetic acceleration). When solving \\cref{si1}, the angular flux at each iteration $m$ has an error associated with it. FPSA systematically follows a predict, correct, iterate scheme. A transport sweep, one iteration in \\cref{si1}, is made for a prediction. The FP approximation is used to correct the error in the prediction, and this iteration is performed until a convergence criterion is met. The equations used are:\n\\begin{subequations}\n\\label{fpsaeq}\n\\begin{align}\n\\label{predict}\n\\mathrm{Predict}&: \\mathcal{L} \\psi^{m+\\frac{1}{2}} = \\mathcal{S} \\psi^{m} + Q\\,,\\\\\n\\label{correct}\n\\mathrm{Correct}&: \\psi^{m+1} =  \\psi^{m+\\frac{1}{2}} + \\mathcal{P}^{-1} \\mathcal{S} \\left( \\psi^{m+\\frac{1}{2}} -  \\psi^{m}\\right),\n\\end{align}\n\\end{subequations}\nwhere we define $\\mathcal{P}$ as\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{FPSAsi1}\n\\mathcal{P} = \\mathcal{A}-\\mathcal{F} =\\underbrace{\\left(\\mu\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\sigma_a\\right)}_\\mathcal{A} - \\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{tr}}{2}\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\mu} (1-\\mu^2) \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\mu}\\right)}_\\mathcal{F},\n\\end{equation} In this synthetic acceleration method, the FP approximation is used to correct the error in each iteration of the high-order (HO) equation (\\ref{predict}). Therefore, there is no consistency between the angular moments of the flux in the HO and low-order (LO) equations. \\subsection{NFPA: Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Acceleration}\\label{NFPA}\n\nSimilar to FPSA, NFPA uses the FP approximation to accelerate the convergence of the solution.

      "A) The increase in H\u03b1 flux is solely due to a resurgence of nuclear burning on the white dwarf, indicating a delayed nova outburst, and this is supported by the observed spectral lines characteristic of novae.",

The flux scaling is\n  approximate. The prominent strong emission lines are marked (see\n  text). }\n\\label{optspec}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe have averaged all spectra (see Fig.~\\ref{optspec}). We find several\nstrong emission lines. The strongest of these emission lines are best\ninterpreted as due to [OIII] 4958.9\\AA\\, and 5006.9\\AA\\,, He~II at\n4685.8\\AA\\, and a blend of the H$\\alpha$ plus the [NII] at 6548.1\\AA\\,\nand 6583.4\\AA\\,, lines found often in novae (Williams 1992). In this\ncase the main [OIII] lines appear redshifted by approximately 2000\\,km\ns$^{-1}$. We interprete this as due to clumpy outflows in the nova\nshell. The integrated light from different outflowing parts can also\nexplain the substructure that is present in the [OIII] lines. The\noutflow velocities that we obtain for the H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ lines\nis $\\approx$350\\,km s$^{-1}$, hence less than that for the [OIII]\nlines. Note that, if XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 does reside within the\nLMC, then the systematic line-of-sight recession velocity of the LMC,\n262$\\pm$3.4\\,km~s$^{-1}$ (van der Marel et al.\\ 2002), should be taken\ninto account; i.e.\\,a good fraction of the observed H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$\nrecession would then be due to the recession of the LMC itself. \\subsection{Long-term Optical light curve}\n\nAnalysis of archival robotic optical survey data from 3-minute CCD\nexposures (pixel size 14\\arcsec.8), obtained with a 70\\,mm (200\\,mm\nfocal length) f/2.8 telephoto lens in the course of the All Sky\nAutomated Survey (ASAS; Pojmanski 2002) show that the visual magnitude\nof this source rose from m$_{V}\\raisebox{-1mm}{$\\stackrel{>}{\\sim}$}$14 to m$_{V}$$\\approx$12 between\nSep.~18, 2005 and Sep.~30, 2005, and then declined rapidly thereafter (see\nFig.\\ref{optlc}). ASAS did not detect any significant emission from\nthe source after around November 2005, the source having dimmed below\nthe limiting magnitude of ASAS.",
      "The decline from the brightest data point ($\\approx$2.2 magnitudes in\n10 days, then a further $\\sim$1.3 magnitudes in 46 days) suggests that\nthis is a nova of the 'very fast' speed class (Warner 1995, Downes\net al.\\ 2001). We estimate that the time that the light curve takes to\ndecline 2 magnitudes below maximum observed brightness is\n8$\\pm$2\\,days (see Section~6). \\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=30 78 453 549,clip,width=7.8cm,angle=270]{12082f10.ps}\n\\caption{All Sky Automated Survey V-band magnitudes of the optical counterpart \nto XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933, during outburst (late September 2005) and afterwards.}\n\\label{optlc}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nThe optical spectrum, showing lines of [OIII] 4958.9\\AA\\, and\n5006.9\\AA\\,, He~II at 4685.8\\AA\\, and a blend of the H$\\alpha$ plus\n[NII] at 6548.1\\AA\\, and 6583.4\\AA\\, suggests that\nXMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 was a nova, observed (in Nov 2007) in the late\nA$_{0}$ auroral phase. The fact that the observed [OIII] lines are not\nin the more usual, optically thin 3:1 ratio, can be explained in terms\nof a clumpy outflow scenario, whereby individual clumps of both\nrest-frame and redward-shifted material are observed, and the\nsuperposition of these account for the observed [OIII] ratio (note\nfurther that density enhancements can change observed [OIII] ratios to\nmore like $\\sim$1:1). Clumps of material are often seen in nova ejecta\n(e.g. Shara et al.\\ 1997), and outflows of speeds around 2000\\,km\ns$^{-1}$ are not uncommon in novae (e.g. in nova LMC 1991; Schwartz\net al.\\ 2001). XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 was likely at its onset (in Oct 2005) a very\nfast, Fe~{\\sc ii} nova (Section~3 and Williams et al.\\ 1991; Williams\net al.\\ 1994). An accurate classification now however is not possible,\nso late after maximum brightness. The soft ($kT_{\\rm\n  eff}$$\\approx$60--70\\,eV) X-ray spectrum indicates that the nova was\nin a super-soft source (SSS) state (Krautter 2008) during its\ndiscovery (in July 2006), and throughout its X-ray decline (by more\nthan two orders of magnitude) in the observations of Sept 2006, March\n2007 and June 2007.",
      "The UVOT images however immediately showed\nthat the optically fainter source at position RA, Dec (J2000) = 06 06\n36.4, -69 49 34.3 (error radius: ~0.5\\arcsec) was a very strong UVW2\nsource and very blue, and was very likely the true counterpart to\nXMMSL1~J060636.2-694933. (The UVW2 filter spans approximately\n800\\AA\\,, centred at $\\approx$1900\\AA)\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=-82 210 695 585,clip,width=8.7cm]{12082f5.ps}\n\\caption{Swift UVOT images of the field around XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 from observation\n  00030895002.

The small circle in the UVW2 image around the\n  bright source is reproduced in the B image, indicating that a faint\n  optical source is also visible at this position.}\n\\label{uvot}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe Swift UVOT pipeline processed data were analysed using the UVOT\nphotometry package {\\em uvotsource} released with\nFTOOLs\\footnote{http://heasarc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/ftools/ftools\\_menu.html}. This package performs aperture photometry on pre-specified source and\nbackground regions, accounting for photometric- (via PSF fitting) and\ncoincidence loss- effects using the UVOT calibration files. Source\ncounts were extracted using a 5\\arcsec\\ radius aperture centred on the\nsource, while for the background we used a 10\\arcsec\\ radius aperture\nlocated in a nearby source-free region. We used a larger background\naperture to effectively smooth over the modulo-8 fixed pattern noise\npresent in UVOT observations and to improve the statistics of the\nbackground counts. Source counts were converted to UVOT UV-magnitudes\nusing the UVW2 zero-point calibration released with version~2.8 (Build\n22) of the CALDB. The source is seen (see Fig.\\,\\ref{uvotlc}) to be\nroughly constant over the short duration of the Swift observations,\nwith a suggestion of a decline towards the end. This is in keeping\nwith the general form of the X-ray lightcurve (Fig.\\,\\ref{lightcurve})\nat this time.",
      "This is shown in Fig.\\ref{xrtuvotspec}. This\nexcess in UV emission (most of the $10^{35}$\\,ergs s$^{-1}$ discussed\nabove) is likely due to a combination of residual post-nova nuclear\nburning on the surface of the white dwarf, plus accretion in the disk,\nincluding from emission lines. The situation is likely to be rather\ncomplex, depending on the structure of both the ejecta and the\naccretion disk, and is beyond the scope of the present work, where we\nonly have sparse UV data. For a review of the UV emission from\nclassical novae, see Shore (2008). \\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=100 15 580 710,clip,width=6.0cm,angle=270]{12082f7.ps}\n\\caption{Swift-XRT spectrum (black) from XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933, plus\n  the best-fit black-body model to this spectrum (Section~3; Fig.\\,2),\n  but extending into the UV to the Swift-UVOT UVW2 flux points (coloured)\n  (see text).

Images were obtained through the Sloan\n$g^\\prime$, $r^\\prime$ and $i^\\prime$ filters. On Nov.~15, 2007\nconditions were photometric and the Landolt field RU 149A was observed\nto flux calibrate the data in the $g^\\prime$, $r^\\prime$ and\n$i^\\prime$--bands. The Landolt (1992) magnitudes of the standards\nwere converted to Sloan magnitudes using the transformations presented\nin Smith et al.\\ (2002). All the images were debiased and flatfielded\nusing dome flatfield frames. We applied aperture photometry on each of\nthe images using DAOPHOT in \\textsc{IRAF}\\footnote{\\textsc {iraf} is\n  distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories} to\ncompute the instrumental magnitudes of the stars.",
      "Differential\nphotometry of the optical counterpart to XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933\n(marked by an arrow in Fig.~\\ref{magellan}) was performed with respect\nto the field star (marked with a `c' in Fig.~\\ref{magellan}). This was the\nbrightest isolated and unsaturated star common to all frames. The\ncalibrated brightness of this comparison star is $g'= 18.42 \\pm 0.04$,\n$r'= 17.85 \\pm 0.06$ and $i'=17.58 \\pm 0.07$.\n\n\\begin{figure} \\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=35 215 575 575,clip,width=8.7cm]{12082f8.ps}\n\\caption{Magellan Clay LDSS3 finder chart.

This set-up provides a mean dispersion of 2\\AA\\,\nper pixel. For a slit width of 1 arcsecond and a mean seeing close to\n1\\arcsec, the mean spectral resolution is $\\approx$10\\AA. On Nov.~13, 2007\nwe took 4 exposures of 450\\,s each, on Nov.~14, 2007 we took 2\nexposures of 900\\,s each, and on Nov.~15, 2007 we took one 1200\\,s\nexposure with the slit at the parallactic angle. The spectra were bias\nand flatfield corrected, and extracted in \\textsc{IRAF}. The\ninstrumental response was corrected using the spectrophotometric flux\ncalibrators LTT 3218 (Nov.~13), H600 (Nov.~14) and LTT 9293 (Nov.~15). Significant differences in the flux around H$\\alpha$ are apparent with\nthe flux being 50\\% higher during the Nov.~15, 2007 with respect to\nthe Nov.~13, 2007 observations. Since there is no evidence for\nbrightening in the $r^\\prime$ images we attribute the difference to\nthe fact that the source was not observed at the parallactic angle on\nNov.~13 and 14, 2007. We exported the one dimensional spectra to the\nspectral analysis software package \\textsc{molly} for further\nanalysis."

Id. at 2103\u201304 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). In Bellas Hess, the Court reasoned that the dormant commerce clause protects interstate business from being \u201centangle[d] . . . in a virtual welter of complicated obligations to local jurisdictions.\u201d Nat\u2019l Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 386 U.S. 753, 759\u201360 (1967). The dissent replied that the Court \u201cvastly underestimate[d] the skill of contemporary man and his machines.\u201d Id. at 766 (Fortas, J., dissenting). The dispute in Wayfair over whether software is up to the task effectively reprised the old debate from Bellas Hess, only this time couched as part of the stare decisis inquiry\u2019s concern for reliance interests rather than as a matter of dormant commerce clause doctrine. While Wayfair acknowledged that \u201c[c]omplex state tax systems could have the effect of discriminating against interstate commerce,\u201d 138 S. Ct. at 2099, the Court remarked that \u201c[t]he physical presence rule is a poor proxy\u201d for an inquiry into any actual burdens imposed on interstate commerce, id. at 2093. Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that a \u201cheightened form of stare decisis\u201d45\u00d7 45. Wayfair, 138 S.

      "whether or not Congress can or will act. \u201d5\u00d7 5. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2096\u201397. Emerging from Wayfair is an odd and ominous development in stare decisis doctrine. Odd, because it turns on a formal classification instead of on Congress\u2019s practical ability to fix the problem. Ominous, because the Court\u2019s logic leads far past the dormant commerce clause. Wayfair grants only feeble stare decisis to precedents that set a \u201cconstitutional default rule,\u201d6\u00d7 6. Id. at 2096 (\u201cWhile . . . Congress has the authority to change the physical presence rule, Congress cannot change the constitutional default rule.\u201d). meaning constitutional decisions that allow for legislative adjustment or override. This new stare decisis analysis makes other precedents setting constitutional default rules more vulnerable \u2014 including, perhaps, mainstays of criminal procedure like Miranda v. Arizona7\u00d7 7. 384 U.S. 436 (1966). and Mapp v. Ohio.8\u00d7 8. 367 U.S. 643 (1961). Since its 1967 decision in National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue,9\u00d7 9. 386 U.S. 753 (1967). the Court has held that, under the \u201cdormant\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d implication of the Commerce Clause,10\u00d7 10. The dormant or negative commerce clause is a judicial derivation from the Commerce Clause \u201cprohibiting States from discriminating against or imposing excessive burdens on interstate commerce without congressional approval,\u201d which \u201cstrikes at one of the chief evils that led to the adoption of the Constitution, namely, state tariffs and other laws that burdened interstate commerce.\u201d Comptroller of the Treasury of Md. v. Wynne, 135 S. Ct. 1787, 1794 (2015). states may not compel remote sellers with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales taxes.11\u00d7 11. See Bellas Hess, 386 U.S. at 759\u201360. In Quill Corp. v. North Dakota,12\u00d7 12. 504 U.S. 298 (1992). the Court refused to overrule the \u201cbright-line, physical-presence requirement\u201d of Bellas Hess, leaning heavily on stare decisis.13\u00d7 13. Id. at 317\u201318. Three Justices joined a concurrence explaining that their decision rested solely \u201con the basis of stare decisis.\u201d",
      "The rule deprived the states of billions of dollars, since they could not force remote sellers to collect the tax and consumers hardly ever paid it on their own.30\u00d7 30. Id. at 2088 (\u201c[C]onsumer compliance rates are notoriously low.\u201d). Quill \u201cserve[d] as a judicially created tax shelter\u201d for remote retailers who do a great deal of business online.31\u00d7 31. Id. at 2094. Satisfied that Bellas Hess and Quill were wrongly decided, the Court then jumped the hurdle of stare decisis. The Quill Court had feared upsetting reliance interests.32\u00d7 32. Quill, 504 U.S. at 317 (\u201cBellas Hess . . . has engendered substantial reliance and has become part of the basic framework of a sizable industry.\u201d). Wayfair shrugged off this concern, noting that \u201cstare decisis accommodates only \u2018legitimate reliance interest[s]\u2019\u201d; by contrast, reliance on the physical presence rule was largely due to consumers evading their use-tax obligations.33\u00d7 33. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2098 (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 824 (1982)). Quill had also appealed to Congress\u2019s ultimate authority over interstate commerce as a reason to abide by a precedent, even if wrongly decided.34\u00d7 34. See Quill, 504 U.S. at 318\u201319; id. at 320 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\u201cCongress . . . can change the rule of Bellas Hess by simply saying so.\u201d). But Wayfair denied that Congress\u2019s ability to change the law was a proper consideration:\nWhile it can be conceded that Congress has the authority to change the physical presence rule, Congress cannot change the constitutional default rule. It is inconsistent with the Court\u2019s proper role to ask Congress to address a false constitutional premise of this Court\u2019s own creation. Courts have acted as the front line of review in this limited sphere; and hence it is important that their principles be accurate and logical, whether or not Congress can or will act in response.35\u00d7 35. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2096\u201397. Having dispensed with the physical presence rule, the Court remanded the case to the South Dakota courts to determine in the first instance \u201cwhether some other principle in the Court\u2019s Commerce Clause doctrine might invalidate the Act.",
      "See supra p. 278. The Court even insisted that to do so \u201cis inconsistent with the Court\u2019s proper role,\u201d since Quill embodied \u201ca false constitutional premise of th[e] Court\u2019s own creation. \u201d57\u00d7 57. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2096 (emphasis added). This refusal breaks from the practical Brandeisian wisdom that has guided the Court\u2019s treatment of precedent for the better part of a century. The point is not that stare decisis should have ultimately propped up Bellas Hess yet again, as Wayfair\u2019s dissenting Justices maintained. After all, a realistic approach that is alert to each branch\u2019s institutional capacities might have led to the conclusion that Congress was actually ill-equipped to overrule Quill. In this vein, the Court could have sensibly pointed out that Congress is unlikely to stick its neck out with a tax hike (or a look-alike) from which only the states would benefit.58\u00d7 58. For two practical arguments to this effect, see Brian Galle, Essay, Kill Quill, Keep the Dormant Commerce Clause: History\u2019s Lessons on Congressional Control of State Taxation, 70 Stan. L. Rev.

Zelinsky, The Political Process Argument for Overruling Quill, 82 Brook. L. Rev. 1177, 1191\u201392 (2017). Indeed, South Dakota advanced such practical arguments in its brief.59\u00d7 59. See Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 54, Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. 2080 (No. 17-494) (\u201cCongress has little incentive to act here because it would be (or appear to be) authorizing new or greater tax collections from its constituents, while receiving none of the revenue in return.\u201d). More generally, the Court might have discussed the limits of the states\u2019 influence in the federal system as a reason not to wait for congressional intervention, a topic it has debated on other occasions.60\u00d7 60. See Richard H. Pildes, Institutional Formalism and Realism in Constitutional and Public Law, 2013 Sup. Ct. Rev. 1, 30\u201332; see also Galle, supra note 58, at 159 (\u201cCongress is not a trustworthy guardian of state fiscal power, making continuing judicial involvement a more appealing prospect.\u201d).",

But the distinction is occasionally said to be between \u201cconstitutional\u201d and \u201cnonconstitutional cases.\u201d See, e.g., Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 543 (1962) (plurality opinion).

Last Term, in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.,3\u00d7 3. 138 S. Ct. 2080 (2018). the Court tinkered with this thinking in overruling an outdated dormant commerce clause precedent.

For which values of $x$ from the interval $\\left[-1,1\\right]$ does the graph of $f\\left(x\\right)$ have a horizontal tangent?\n\n\\vspace{10pt}\n\n\\end{minipage}\n\n\\end{center}\n\n\\end{minipage}}\n\n\\vspace{12pt}\n\nProblems with similar formulations can be found in many Calculus books \\cite{Stewart2012}, \\cite{Larson2010}, \\cite{Thomas2009}. Following the common procedure, let us find the expression for the derivative of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ applying the Product Rule:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nf'\\left(x\\right) &=& \\left(\\sqrt[3]{x}\\right)'\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}+\\left(\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}\\right)'\\sqrt[3]{x} \\notag \\\\ &=& \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}}\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}+2x\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}\\sqrt[3]{x} \\notag \\\\ &=& \\frac{6x^2\\cos{x^2}+\\sin{x^2}}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}} \\label{DerivativeExpression}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nSimilar to \\cite{Stewart2012}, we find the values of $x$ where the derivative $f'\\left(x\\right)$ is equal to zero:\n\\begin{equation}\n6x^2\\cos{x^2}+\\sin{x^2} = 0 \n\\label{DerivativeEqualZero}\n\\end{equation}\n\nSince the expression for the derivative (\\ref{DerivativeExpression}) is not defined at $x=0$, it is not hard to see that for all values of $x$ from $\\left[-1,1\\right]$ distinct from zero, the left-hand side of (\\ref{DerivativeEqualZero}) is always positive. Hence, we conclude that the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ does not have horizontal tangent lines on the interval $\\left[-1,1\\right]$.\n\nHowever, a closer look at the graph of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ seems to point at a different result: there is a horizontal tangent at $x=0$ (see Figure \\ref{fig:FunctionGraph}).",
      "x \\neq 0 \\\\ \n0, & \\mbox{if } x = 0 \n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nThe expression for the derivative of the function provides the correct value of the derivative only for those values of the independent variable, for which the expression is defined; it does not tell anything about the existence or the value of the derivative, where the expression for the derivative is undefined. Indeed, let us consider the function\n\\begin{equation*}\ng\\left(x\\right) = {\\sqrt[3]{x}}\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}\n\\end{equation*}\nand its derivative $g'\\left(x\\right)$ \n\\begin{equation*}\ng'\\left(x\\right) = \\frac{\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}-6x^2\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nSimilar to the previous example, the expression for the derivative is undefined at $x=0$. Nonetheless, it can be shown that $g\\left(x\\right)$ is not differentiable at $x=0$ (see Figure \\ref{fig:GFunction}). Therefore, we provided two visually similar functions: both have the expressions for their derivatives undefined in zero, however, one of these functions possesses a derivative, but the other one does not.\n\n\\section{Methodological Remarks} Unfortunately, there exist many functions similar to the ones discussed above and they can arise in a variety of typical Calculus problems: finding the points where the tangent line is horizontal, finding an equation of the tangent and normal lines to the curve at the given point, the use of differentials and graph sketching. Relying only on the expression of the derivative for determining its value at the undefined points may lead to missing a solution (as in the example discussed above) or to some completely false interpretations (as in the case of curve sketching). As it was discussed above, the expression for the derivative does not provide any information on the existence or the value of the derivative, where the expression itself is undefined. Here we present a methodology for the analysis of this type of functions. Let $f\\left(x\\right)$ be the function of interest and $f'\\left(x\\right)$ be the expression of its derivative undefined at some point $x_{0}$.",
      "In order to find out if $f\\left(x\\right)$ is differentiable at $x_{0}$, we suggest to follow a list of steps:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item Check if the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ itself is defined at the point $x_{0}$. If $f\\left(x\\right)$ is undefined at $x_{0}$, then it is not differentiable at $x_{0}$. If $f\\left(x\\right)$ is defined at $x_{0}$, then proceed to next step. \\item Identify the basic functions that are used in the formula of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$, that are themselves defined at the point $x_{0}$, but their derivative is not (such as, for example, the root functions). \\item Find the derivative of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ at the point $x_{0}$ using definition. \\end{enumerate}\n\nThe importance of the first step comes from the fact that most students tend to pay little attention to the functions domain analysis when asked to investigate its derivative. Formally, the second step can be skipped, however it will give the students the insight into which part of the function presents a problem and teach them to identify similar cases in the future. the difficulty of accomplishing the third step depends on the form of the function and sometimes can be tedious. Nevertheless, it allows the students to apply the previously obtained skills and encourages the review of the material.\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\begin{center}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=6.0in]{cos.pdf}\n\t\\vspace{.1in}\n\t\\caption{Graph of the function $g\\left(x\\right)=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}$}\n\t\\label{fig:GFunction}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe discussed the misconception, that the expression of the derivative of the function contains the information as to whether the function is differentiable or not at the points, where the expression is undefined. We considered a typical Calculus problem of looking for the horizontal tangent line of a function as an example. We showed how the search for the values that make the expression of the derivative equal zero leads to missing a solution: even though the expression of the derivative is undefined, the function still possesses the derivative at the point.",
      "\\section{Introduction}\n\nDerivate is one of the most important topics not only in mathematics, but also in physics, chemistry, economics and engineering. Every standard Calculus course provides a variety of exercises for the students to learn how to apply the concept of derivative. The types of problems range from finding an equation of the tangent line to the application of differentials and advanced curve sketching. Usually, these exercises heavily rely on such differentiation techniques as Product, Quotient and Chain Rules, Implicit and Logarithmic Differentiation \\cite{Stewart2012}. The definition of the derivative is hardly ever applied after the first few classes and its use is not much motivated. Like many other topics in undergraduate mathematics, derivative gave rise to many misconceptions \\cite{Muzangwa2012}, \\cite{Gur2007}, \\cite{Li2006}. Just when the students seem to learn how to use the differentiation rules for most essential functions, the application of the derivative brings new issues. A common students' error of determining the domain of the derivative from its formula is discussed in \\cite{Rivera2013} and some interesting examples of the derivatives, defined at the points where the functions themselves are undefined, are provided. However, the hunt for misconceptions takes another twist for the derivatives undefined at the points where the functions are in fact defined. The expression of the derivative of the function obtained using differentiation techniques does not necessarily contain the information about the existence or the value of the derivative at the points, where the expression for the derivative is undefined. In this article we discuss a type of continuous functions that have the expression for the derivative undefined at a certain point, while the derivative itself at that point exists. We show, how relying on the formula for the derivative for finding the horizontal tangent line of a function, leads to a false conclusion and consequently to missing a solution.",
      "Students are expected to develop a skill of deriving similar results and know how to find the derivative of the function using definition of the derivative only. But how `legal' are the performed operations?\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\begin{center}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=6.0in]{sin.pdf}\n\t\\vspace{.1in}\n\t\\caption{Graph of the function $g\\left(x\\right)=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}$}\n\t\\label{fig: GFunction}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nLet us consider each of the following limits: \n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{x+h}-\\sqrt[3]{x}}{h}} \\notag \\\\\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}\\notag \\\\\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sin{\\left(x+h\\right)^2}-\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{h}}\\notag \\\\\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\sqrt[3]{x+h}}. \\end{eqnarray*}\nThe last three limits exist for all real values of the variable $x$. However, the first limit does not exist when $x=0$.

When the derivation is performed, we automatically assume the conditions, under which the Product Law for limits can be applied, i.e. that both limits that are multiplied exist. It is not hard to see that in our case these conditions are actually equivalent to $x\\neq0$. This is precisely why, when we wrote out the expression for the derivative (\\ref{DerivativeExpression}), it already contained the assumption that it is only true for the values of $x$ that are different from zero. Note, that in the case of $x=0$ the application of the Product and Sum Laws for limits is not necessary, since the term $\\left(\\sqrt[3]{x+h}-\\sqrt[3]{x}\\right)\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}$ vanishes.

    "question": "Considering the distribution of power-law exponents for large price movements in cryptocurrencies, which of the following statements is most accurate?",

      "A) Cryptocurrencies with larger market capitalization consistently exhibit power-law exponents that are significantly higher than those of smaller cryptocurrencies.",
      "B) The relationship between market capitalization and power-law exponents is complex and heterogeneous, with some cryptocurrencies showing positive correlations, others negative correlations, and some showing no correlation at all.",
      "C) The power-law exponents for positive and negative returns are consistently equal across all cryptocurrencies, regardless of their age or market capitalization.",
      "D) Cryptocurrencies with longer histories tend to exhibit power-law exponents that decrease over time, indicating a decrease in price volatility."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "Panels (c) and (d) show the distributions of these median exponents when considering the top 2000 and the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, respectively. We observe that the distributions of \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 tend to shift toward larger values when considering the largest cryptoassets. number of return observations (between 100 and 300 days) and filtering out cryptoassets with missing observations (Supplementary Figures ). Still, it is worth noticing the existence of a few cryptoassets (9 of them) with relatively small market capitalization (ranking below the top 1000) for which the power-law hypothesis is always rejected (Supplementary Table ). Having verified that large price movements in the cryptocurrency market are generally well-described by powerlaw distributions, we now focus on the power-law exponents that typically characterize each cryptoasset. To do so, we select all exponent estimates over the entire history of each digital asset for which the power-law hypothesis is not rejected and calculate their median values for both the positive ( \u03b1+ ) and negative ( \u03b1\u2212 ) returns. The dashed lines in Fig. ) show these median values for Bitcoin where \u03b1+ = 4.50 and \u03b1\u2212 = 2.99. It is worth noticing that the variance of large price movements \u03c3 2 is finite only for \u03b1 > 3, as the integral \u03c3 2 \u223c \u221e r min r 2 p(r)dr diverges outside this interval. Thus, while the typical variance of large positive returns is finite for Bitcoin, negative returns are at the limit of not having a typical scale and are thus susceptible to much larger variations. Figure shows the probability distribution for the median power-law exponents of all cryptoassets grouped by large positive and negative returns. We note that the distribution of typical power-law exponents associated with large positive returns is shifted to smaller values when compared with the distribution of exponents related to large negative returns. The medians of these typical exponents are respectively 2.78 and 3.11 for positive and negative returns.",
      "We have also replicated the previous analysis when considering cryptocurrencies in the top 2000 and top 200 rankings of market capitalization (as of July 2022).\nFigures ) and 2(d) show the probability distribution for the median power-law exponents of these two groups. We observe that these distributions are more localized (particularly for the top 200) than the equivalent distributions for all cryptocurrencies. The fraction of cryptocurrencies with no typical scale for large price returns ( \u03b1+ \u2264 3 and \u03b1\u2212 \u2264 3) is significantly lower in these two groups compared to all cryptocurrencies. In the top 2000 cryptocurrencies, 51% have \u03b1+ \u2264 3 and 26% have \u03b1\u2212 \u2264 3. These fractions are even smaller among the top 200 cryptocurrencies, with only 44% and 15% not presenting a typical scale for large positive and negative price returns, respectively. We further observe a decrease in the fraction of cryptoassets for which the average value for large price returns is not even finite, as only 2% and 1% of top 2000 cryptoassets have \u03b1+ \u2264 2 and \u03b1\u2212 \u2264 2. This reduction is more impressive among the top 200 cryptocurrencies as only the cryptoasset Fei USD (FEI, rank 78) has \u03b1+ = 1.97 and none is characterized by \u03b1\u2212 \u2264 2. The medians of \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 also increase from 2.78 and 3.11 for all cryptocurrencies to 2.98 and 3.35 for the top 2000 and to 3.08 and 3.58 for the top 200 cryptocurrencies. Conversely, the asymmetry between positive and negative large price returns does not differ much among the three groups, with the condition \u03b1+ < \u03b1\u2212 holding only for a slightly larger fraction of top 2000 (69.1%) and top 200 (70.6%) cryptoassets compared to all cryptocurrencies (66.4%). Moreover, all these patterns are robust when filtering out time series with sampling issues or when considering only cryptoassets that stay compatible with the power-law hypothesis in more than 90% of the positions of the expanding time window (Supplementary Figures ). We also investigate whether the patterns related to the median of the power-law exponents differ among groups of cryptocurrencies with different designs and purposes.",
      "Remarkably, the hypothesis that large price movements (positive or negative) follow a power-law distribution is never rejected over the entire history of about 70% of all digital currencies in our dataset. This analysis also shows that only \u22482% of cryptocurrencies reject the power-law hypothesis in more than half of the positions of the expanding time window ( f r \u2265 0.5). For instance, considering a 10% threshold as a criterion ( f r \u2264 0.1), we find that about 85% of cryptocurrencies have return distributions adequately modeled by power laws. Increasing this threshold to a more lenient 20% threshold ( f r \u2264 0.2), we find large price movements to be power-law distributed for about 91% of cryptocurrencies. These results thus provide strong evidence that cryptoassets, fairly generally, present large price movements quite well described by power-law distributions. Moreover, this conclusion is robust when starting the expanding window with a greater . Large price movements are power-law distributed over the entire history of most cryptocurrencies with median values typically smaller than those found for traditional assets. (a) Percentage of cryptoassets rejecting the power-law hypothesis for large positive (blue) or negative (red) price returns in at most a given fraction of the weekly positions of the expanding time window ( f r ) used to sample the return series. Remarkably, 68% of all 7111 digital currencies are compatible with the power-law hypothesis over their entire history, and about 91% of them reject the power-law hypothesis in less than 20% of the positions of the expanding time window ( f r \u2264 0.2). (b) Probability distributions obtained via kernel density estimation of the median values of the power-law exponents along the history of each digital currency. The blue curve shows the distribution of the median exponents related to positive returns ( \u03b1+ ) and the red curve does the same for negative returns ( \u03b1\u2212 ). The medians of \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 are indicated by vertical dashed lines.",
      "Thus, there is no evidence of a unique overall pattern for the association between the power-law exponents and age or market capitalization followed by a significant part of the cryptocurrency market. Indeed, the 94% highest density intervals for \u03c3 A ([0.87, 0.93] for positive and [0.63, 0.70] for negative returns) and \u03c3 C ([0.57, 0.61] for positive and [0.49, 0.52] for negative returns) indicate that the cryptocurrency market is highly heterogeneous regarding the evolution of power-law exponents associated with large price variations (see Supplementary Figure for the distributions of \u03c3 A and \u03c3 C ). Figure illustrates these heterogeneous behaviors by plotting the posterior probability distributions for the linear coefficients associated with the effects of age (A) and market capitalization (C) for the top 20 digital assets, where cryptocurrencies which are significantly affected (that is, the 94% highest density intervals for A or C do not include the zero) by these quantities are highlighted in boldface. Even this small selection of digital  currencies already presents a myriad of patterns. First, we observe that the power-law exponents of a few top 20 cryptocurrencies are neither correlated with age nor market capitalization. That is the case of Shiba Inu (SHIB, rank 13) and Dai (DAI, rank 11) for both positive and negative returns, UNUS SED LEO (LEO, rank 18) and Polkadot (DOT, rank 12) for the positive returns, and USDCoin (USDC, rank 4) and Solana (SOL, rank 9) for negative returns. There are also cryptocurrencies with exponents positively or negatively correlated only with market capitalization. Examples include Tether (USDT, rank 3) and Dogecoin (DOGE, rank 10), for which the power-law exponents associated with positive returns increase with market capitalization, and Binance USD (BUSD, rank 6), for which power-law exponents associated with positive and negative returns decrease with market capitalization. We also observe cryptocurrencies for which age and market capitalization simultaneously affect the power-law exponents.",
      "Finally, the former levels are classified regarding whether the power-law exponents increase, decrease or have a mixed trend with the predictive variables. Overall, 36% of the associations are classified as mixed trends (green rectangles), 28% are increasing trends (blue rectangles), and 26% are decreasing trends (red rectangles). We have studied the distributions of large price variations of a significant part of the digital assets that currently comprise the entirety of the cryptocurrency market. Unlike previous work, we have estimated these distributions for entire historical price records of each digital currency, and we have identified the patterns under which the return distributions change as cryptoassets age and grow in market capitalization. Similarly to conventional financial assets , our findings show that the return distributions of the vast majority of cryptoassets have tails that are described well by power-law functions along their entire history. The typical power-law exponents of cryptocurrencies (\u03b1 \u223c 3) are, however, significantly smaller than those reported for conventional assets (\u03b1 \u223c 4) . This feature corroborates the widespread belief that cryptoassets are indeed considerably more risky for investments than stocks or other more traditional financial assets. Indeed, we have found that about half of the cryptocurrencies in our analysis do not have a characteristic scale for price variations, and are thus prone to much higher price variations than those typically observed in stock markets. On the upside, we have also identified an asymmetry in the power-law exponents for positive and negative returns in about 2/3 of all considered cryptocurrencies, such that these exponents are smaller for positive than they are for negative returns. This means that sizable positive price variations have generally been more likely to occur than equally sizable negative price variations, which in turn may also reflect the recent overall expansion of the cryptocurrency market."

      "We have no\ninformation over the 12 days between the data point of maximum\nbrightness and the lower limit prior to this (Fig.\\,\\ref{optlc}), and\ntherefore we have no exact outburst date, nor exact apparent\nmagnitude at outburst. Assuming for the moment though that we have\ncaught the outburst exactly in the Sep.~30, 2005 observation, then we\ncan estimate (Sect.~5.3) $t_{2}$ to be 8$\\pm$2\\,days, and using this,\nwe can estimate (Della Valle \\& Livio 1995) the absolute magnitude at\nmaximum brightness $M_{V}$ to be --8.7$\\pm$0.6. An absolute magnitude\nof $M_{V}$=--8.7 implies a peak luminosity $\\sim$7 times the Eddington\nluminosity for a 1\\,$M_{\\odot}$ white dwarf. This is quite typical of\nnovae. With $A_{V}$=0.39$^{+0.05}_{-0.09}$ (90\\% error), as derived (Predehl\n\\& Schmitt 1995) from $N_{\\rm\n  H}$=6.9$^{+1.0}_{-1.6}\\times10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$ (from the highest\nstatistic spectral fit; the XMM-Newton ToO observation), and with\n$M_{V}$=--8.7$\\pm$0.6, and a peak $m_{V}$ of 12.0, we can derive a\ndistance to XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 of 115$^{+43}_{-30}$\\,kpc. As\ndiscussed above however, we are unsure as to the exact outburst date\nand the maximum brightness at outburst. Our assumed peak $m_{V}$ of\n12.0 is almost certainly an underestimation. Although we have no\ninformation in the 12 days prior to Sep.~30, 2005, a simple linear\nextrapolation of the early October lightcurve back prior to Sep.~30,\n2005 suggests that the actual peak $m_{V}$ was somewhere between 9 and\n12. The corresponding distance estimates are then between 29 and\n115\\,kpc (with a mid-point $m_{V}$=10.5 value yielding a distance\nestimate of 58\\,kpc). Many methods have been used to estimate the\ndistance to the LMC (e.g.  Kovacs 2000, Nelson et al.\\ 2000), but a\nvalue of around 50\\,kpc appears to be quite robust. Our distance\nestimate is certainly consistent with that of the LMC, though the\nerrors are quite large. It does appear to be the case however, that\nour distance estimate places the source far outside of our own Galaxy. This, together with the source's position on the sky (at the eastern\nedge of the LMC) and the sizable ($\\sim$Galactic) X-ray hydrogen\ncolumn densities obtained from the spectral fits, suggest strongly\nthat XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 lies within the LMC itself.",
      "The decline from the brightest data point ($\\approx$2.2 magnitudes in\n10 days, then a further $\\sim$1.3 magnitudes in 46 days) suggests that\nthis is a nova of the 'very fast' speed class (Warner 1995, Downes\net al.\\ 2001).

The fact that the observed [OIII] lines are not\nin the more usual, optically thin 3:1 ratio, can be explained in terms\nof a clumpy outflow scenario, whereby individual clumps of both\nrest-frame and redward-shifted material are observed, and the\nsuperposition of these account for the observed [OIII] ratio (note\nfurther that density enhancements can change observed [OIII] ratios to\nmore like $\\sim$1:1). Clumps of material are often seen in nova ejecta\n(e.g. Shara et al.\\ 1997), and outflows of speeds around 2000\\,km\ns$^{-1}$ are not uncommon in novae (e.g. in nova LMC 1991; Schwartz\net al.\\ 2001). XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 was likely at its onset (in Oct 2005) a very\nfast, Fe~{\\sc ii} nova (Section~3 and Williams et al.\\ 1991; Williams\net al.\\ 1994). An accurate classification now however is not possible,\nso late after maximum brightness. The soft ($kT_{\\rm\n  eff}$$\\approx$60--70\\,eV) X-ray spectrum indicates that the nova was\nin a super-soft source (SSS) state (Krautter 2008) during its\ndiscovery (in July 2006), and throughout its X-ray decline (by more\nthan two orders of magnitude) in the observations of Sept 2006, March\n2007 and June 2007.",

All the XMM-Newton EPIC data, i.e.  the data\nfrom the two MOS cameras and the single pn camera, were taken in\nfull-frame mode with the thin filter in place. These data from the\nthree EPIC instruments have been reprocessed using the standard\nprocedures in XMM-Newton SAS (Science Analysis System) $-$ v.7.1.0. Periods of high-background, of which there were very few, were\nfiltered out of each dataset by creating a high-energy 10$-$15\\,keV\nlightcurve of single events over the entire field of view, and\nselecting times when this lightcurve peaked above 0.75\\,ct s$^{-1}$\n(for pn) or 0.25\\,ct s$^{-1}$ (for MOS). This resulted in\n$\\approx$9.4(8.0)\\,ks of low-background MOS(pn) data. Details of this dedicated\nXMM-Newton observation, together with source position, and\n(0.2$-$2\\,keV) all-EPIC combined (pn, MOS1, MOS2) detected source\ncounts, count rate and detection likelihood are given in\nTable~\\ref{slewtable}.",
      "Such a state originates from nuclear burning on\nthe surface of the white dwarf, and measurements of the intensity,\nduration, and temperature can be used to estimate the distance to the\nnova and the mass of the white dwarf (e.g. Balman et al.\\ 1998; Lanz\net al.\\ 2005). Indeed, we believe (Section~4) that the white dwarf\nwithin XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 may be quite massive\n($>$1.2$M_{\\odot}$). As discussed earlier, classical novae are almost always discovered\noptically in the early phases of their outbursts. XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 is very unusual therefore in that it has been\ndiscovered first in X-rays. As such, it is useful to compare it with\nXMMSL1~J070542.7-381442 (also known as V598 Pup; Read et al.\\ 2008),\nanother nova recently discovered (in X-rays) in the XMM-Newton slew\nsurvey. With a peak $m_{V}$ of $\\ltsim12$, XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 is\nnot a particularly bright nova (c.f. V598 Pup, which reached an\nm$_{V}$ of $\\raisebox{-1mm}{$\\stackrel{<}{\\sim}$}$4), and so it is not surprising that it went\nunnoticed, only being discovered in X-rays during the later (here\n291\\,days after the outburst), optically thin nebular phase, when\nclassical novae are typically observed as soft X-ray sources. Though\nthis delay should be taken as a upper limit, it is long when compared\nto V598 Pup ($\\raisebox{-1mm}{$\\stackrel{<}{\\sim}$}$127 days), but may instead be more similar to the\ndelays of $\\sim$200 days seen in V1974 Cyg (Krautter et al.\\ 1996),\n$\\sim$6 months of V382 Vel (Orio et al.\\ 2002), and 6$-$8 months of\nV1494 Aql (Drake et al.\\ 2003). In their X-ray monitoring of optical\nnovae in M31, Pietsch et al.\\ (2007) detect 11 out of 34 novae in\nX-rays within a year after their optical outbursts. Seven novae are\nseen to be X-ray bright, several (3$-$9) years after outburst, and\nthree novae showed very short X-ray outbursts, starting within\n50\\,days of outburst, but lasting only two to three months. XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 therefore is not particularly unusual. A method to estimate the distance to the nova is to use the relation\nbetween the absolute magnitude at maximum brightness and the time that\nthe light curve takes to decline 2 magnitudes below maximum\nbrightness, $t_{2}$ (Della Valle \\& Livio 1995).",
      "X-ray\nlightcurve of XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 is shown in\nFig.\\,\\ref{lightcurve}. The calculated (0.2$-$2.0\\,keV) flux values\nare shown plotted against the number of days since the rev.\\,1210\nXMM-Newton Slew discovery. The first two data points are the\nrev.\\,1210 and the rev.\\,1246 XMM-Newton Slew observations. Then the\nthree nested Swift-XRT points are shown and finally the XMM-Newton ToO\nobservation. The level of RASS upper limit is shown to the bottom\nleft. The (0.2$-$2.0\\,keV) X-ray flux is seen to have dropped by more\nthan two orders of magnitude in 230 days since the discovery, but is\nthen seen to have levelled off for the next 120 days, at a level still\n$\\approx$3 times that of the RASS. Finally, no evidence for any\nshort-term variability (using time bins down to 100\\,s) is seen in the\nhighest statistic continuous X-ray lightcurve (the $\\approx$8.0\\,ksec\nbackground-filtered EPIC-pn lightcurve) obtained from the 19/06/07\nXMM-Newton observation. \\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=60 60 550 454,clip,width=8.7cm]{12082f4.ps} \\caption{The full X-ray lightcurve of XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933.

      "In this seminar we will consider such questions as whether the American system is prone to deadlock of stalemate in the construction of national policy; whether conflict is a hindrance to institutional responsibility or an essential attribute of responsibility; whether there are \u201cpolitical questions\u201d especially suitable to resolution between President and Congress; how one can distinguish salutary from pathological conflict, and whether it is truly possible to harness the ambition of office holders to the duties of their office. More specifically, we will review literature and arguments regarding constitutional reform; divided government; separation of powers theory; and case studies of Supreme Court appointments; the budget process; and war powers and foreign affairs. In these contexts we will also discuss current controversies surrounding war authorization, intelligence and secrecy, sequestration, government shut downs and budget resolutions, and debt ceiling politics. The course is designed to accommodate two different student needs: it will provide a good overview of important literature relevant to the comprehensive examination in American politics and it will provide opportunities for research. This subject area is a treasure trove of \u201chot\u201d topics, publication possibilities, subjects for MA theses and Ph.D. dissertations. I will tailor the written requirements to the objectives of individual students. 1. All students will prepare a short analytic essay early in the semester, and an annotated bibliography at mid-semester. These assignments will count (30%) of the grade. 2. Students interested primarily in exam preparation will complete an examination near the end of the semester based on study questions assigned in advance. OR\nStudents interested in research will write a 20-25 page paper. (60%)\n3. A basic requirement of the course is that students prepare for each seminar by carefully reading the material assigned for that week. Class discussion is an essential component of the course.",

      "Endothelium: A single-cell layer of flat endothelial cells lining the closed internal spaces of the body such as the inside of blood vessels. Endothelial dysfunction affects the ability of these cells to help dilate blood vessels, control inflammation or prevent blood clots. The endothelium is associated with most forms of cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney failure, and severe viral infections. Enhanced External Counterpulsation \u2013 EECP is an FDA-approved non-invasive, non-drug treatment for angina. It works by promoting the development of collateral coronary arteries. The therapy is widely used in prominent heart clinics such as the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins \u2013 especially for patients who are not good candidates for invasive procedures such as bypass surgery, angioplasty or stenting. EP \u2013 Electrophysiologist: A cardiologist who has additional training in diagnosing/treating heart rhythm disorders. EPS \u2013 Electrophysiology Study: A test that uses cardiac catheterization to study patients who have arrhythmias (abnormal hear rhythm). An electrical current stimulates the heart in an effort to provoke an arrhythmia, which is immediately treated with medications. EPS is used primarily to identify the origin of the arrhythmia and to test the effectiveness of medications used to treat abnormal heart rhythms. EVH \u2013 Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting: To create the bypass graft during CABG open heart surgery, a surgeon will remove or \u201charvest\u201d healthy blood vessels from another part of the body, often from the patient\u2019s leg or arm. This vessel becomes a graft, with one end attaching to a blood source above and the other end below the blocked area. See CABG. Exercise stress test \u2013 An exercise test (walking/running on a treadmill or pedalling a stationary bike) to make your heart work harder and beat faster. An EKG is recorded while you exercise to monitor any abnormal changes in your heart under stress, with or without the aid of drugs to enhance this assessment.",
      "Symptoms include leg pain when walking (called intermittent claudication). PAF \u2013 Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Atrial fibrillation that lasts from a few seconds to days, then stops on its own. See also Atrial Fibrillation. Palpitations \u2013 A noticeably rapid, strong, or irregular heartbeat due to agitation, exertion or illness. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation \u2013 An unusual heart arrhythmia of unknown origin, at one time believed to be associated with an unusual sensitivity to alcohol consumption. PDA \u2013 patent ductus arteriosus: A persistent opening between two major blood vessels leading from the heart. The opening is called ductus arteriosus and is a normal part of a baby\u2019s circulatory system before birth that usually closes shortly after birth. But when it remains open, it\u2019s called a patent ductus arteriosus. If it\u2019s small, it may never need treatment, but a large PDA left untreated can allow poorly oxygenated blood to flow in the wrong direction, weakening the heart muscle and causing heart failure or other complications. Pericardium: two thin layers of a sac-like tissue that surround the heart, hold it in place and help it work. PET \u2013 Positron Emission Tomography: A non-invasive scanning technique that uses small amounts of radioactive positrons (positively charged particles) to visualize body function and metabolism.

      "New Summoner Boosts have arrived in the Loyalty Store; NEW Boost types, purchasable with Loyalty Points. Class specific Boosts, such as Mystic Champions restoring power after using Special Attacks 2 and 3, or Skill Champions boosting their Special Attack Damage. Defensive Boosts, where your Champions take reduced incoming Special 3 Attack Damage. Gain a temporary Arena Point boost with new Arena Boost items! Fixed an issue where, after Parrying certain Champion\u2019s Special Attacks, your Champion would be stuck in a blocking state until the Special Attack finished. Fixed an issue where 90s Cyclops\u2019 Armor Breaks would not remove Armor Ups. Fixed an issue with Scarlet Witch\u2019s Signature Ability proc rate (previously, the % chance displayed did not match in-game functionality; this is now fixed). (Netflix) Daredevil\u2019s Heavy Attack now has a chance to apply 2 stacks of Armor Break, instead of the previous 1 stack. When spending Battlechips to enter an Arena (such as the Tier 4 Basic or Alpha Catalyst Arena), there is now a confirmation popup. The Alliance Crystal now has a purchase limit that resets daily. Permanently increased the Alliance Crystal\u2019s points in Summoner Advancement (from 30 to 300). Updates to Champion Special Attack animations, flow, and timing. 7.0.1 will be released within the next few days. A celebration message is sent to the War Room when an Alliance War battlegroup is cleared. Players can now tap directly on another node icon while the tile info popup is open (previously, the popup had to be closed before selecting another node). Alliance\u2019s reward tier position is now highlighted in the Alliance War tier breakdown. In Attack Phase, players can view the score breakdown for both the battlegroup and overall. The \u201cPlace Your Defenders\u201d text now disappears much faster after tapping on the screen. Mail messages now display the date they were sent. It should be much harder to accidentally tap the Units Store when closing a screen. Players can tap to skip the point animation in Versus mode again."

      "However, it came into management and strategic management literature as a research interest from the mid-1990s [29, 30]. Although business model had its roots in IS and ICT, the amount of research work on cyber security as a context is still quite negligible harnessing the potential of business model concept. The concept of business models lies at the intersection of entrepreneurship and strategy, it can be observed as a bridge between abstract strategies and the practical implementation of strategic decisions and actions amidst the uncertainties of the modern business context [11\u201314, 31]. For instance, Zott and Amit  conceptualize business model as a \u2018boundary-spanning\u2019 set of activities aimed at creating and appropriating value. Morris et al.  viewed the concept of the business model as a set of decisions related to the venture strategy, architecture, and economics of firm (value creation and capture) that need addressing to create sustainable competitive advantage in the chosen markets and specific contexts. As a boundary-spanning unit of analysis, business models , connects an organization with its business environment, other organizations, customers, individuals and society as well; with the overall ecosystem at large [34, 35]. Trying to bridge business models and cyber security under current context, there are two core issues. First, as almost all of the entities operating within the digital sphere face multifaceted cyber threats, how can business model approach help organizations to respond to such situations? Second, how can business model approach help to identify opportunities and monetize security in future 5G? In the next two sub-chapters, we present two business model approaches that are suitable for ICT contexts, and, can help find answers to the above mentioned questions. As the mobile telecommunications industry advanced, so did business model related discussions in the literature about extending organizational boundaries through vertical and horizontal integration in industries ."
