      "While these service provisioning scenarios are relevant to overall 5G, they are also significantly related to the case of IoT-MDM system/services. Figure 3 Scenarios for 5G cybersecurity provisioning [Adapted from 35]. As a result, we find four major drivers of security, which potentially will come with new business opportunities in the 5G era. Device driven security comprises distributed and D2D security techniques. Platform driven security will focus on centralized and D2D security techniques. Whereas, network infrastructure driven security should focus on centralized and infrastructure security methods. Lastly, location driven security should harness distributed and infrastructure security techniques. In a quest to identify potential business entities operating in each of the quadrants relevant to device management, we recognize a ‘secure device manufacturer/provider’ focuses on device-driven security. Currently, multiple device manufacturers are developing devices where security features are built-in, regardless of which network or websites the users are accessing. This built-in security can be offered to multiple kinds of devices including smartphones, tablets, pcs, wearables, and even to IoT devices with communication and computation capability. These secure devices are built in a way that it will control access to potentially harmful networks, websites, and content; even without any commercially available security applications installed. However, when a customer enterprise (e.g. the future digital hospital) is buying a fleet of hundreds of such secure devices, the question raises how to manage and configure all these devices from time-to-time. In such a case, even the secure devices will need IoT-MDM services for proper management and seamless upgrading when needed. For the platform-driven security, we observe a ‘traditional IoT-MDM system provider’ can be a good example. In many cases, IoT-MDM system providers are selling there device management systems to enterprises directly."

      "Such processes give rise to an exchange mechanism \\cite{Yao},\nthat we henceforth refer to as \\emph{the CAR exchange}, which can greatly modify\nthe low-temperature transport behavior of correlated hybrid nanostructures. The CAR exchange may be seen as RKKY-like interaction between\ntwo nearby impurities on SC surface \\cite{Yao}. The effect can be understood as a consequence\nof spin-dependent hybridization of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR)\nstates \\cite{Yu,Shiba,Rusinov} in SC contact,\ncaused both by the overlap of their wave functions\nand their coupling to Cooper-pair condensate. This process is the most effective when the YSR states \nare close to the middle of the SC gap, {\\it e.g.} in the YSR-screened phase \\cite{YSRscreening}. The mechanism presented here is essentially the same,\nyet in the considered regime can be understood\nperturbatively without referring to YSR states,\nas a consequence of the non-local pairing induced by SC electrode. In particular, the presence of YSR bound states close to the Fermi level \nis not necessary for significant consequences for the Kondo physics, \nas long as some inter-dot pairing is present. The proximity of SC induces pairing in QDs \\cite{RozhkovArovas,Buitelaar} \nand tends to suppress the Kondo effect if the superconducting energy gap $2\\Delta$ \nbecomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature $T_K$ \n\\cite{Buitelaar2002Dec,adatomsSC,Kondo_vs_SC1,Kondo_vs_SC2,Zitko_Kondo-Andreev,Zitko_S-QD-N,IW_Sau,YSRscreening}. Moreover, the strength of SC pairing can greatly affect the Kondo physics in the sub-gap transport regime: For QDs attached to SC and normal contacts, it can enhance the Kondo effect\n\\cite{DomanskiIW,KWIW,part1}, while\nfor DQD-based Cooper pair splitters, it tends to suppress both the $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Kondo effects \\cite{IW_Kacper}. Our main result is that the non-local pairing induced by superconducting \nproximity effect, which gives rise to CAR exchange, can be the sole cause of the Kondo screening. Moreover, relatively small values of coupling to SC, $\\GS{}\\ll U$, are sufficient for the effect to occur."

      "At the same time disks and\noutflows evolve, which should hence have similar time-scales. The\ndiameter of the shell-like C$_2$H structure in IRAS\\,18089-1732 is\n$\\sim 5''$ (Fig.\\,\\ref{18089}), or $\\sim$9000\\,AU in radius at the\ngiven distance of 3.6\\,kpc. This value is well matched by the modeled\nregion with decreased C$_2$H abundance (Fig.\\,\\ref{model}). Although\nin principle optical depths and/or excitation effects could mimic the\nC$_2$H morphology, we consider this as unlikely because the other\nobserved molecules with many different transitions all peak toward the\ncentral submm continuum emission in IRAS\\,18089-1732\n\\citep{beuther2005c}. Since C$_2$H is the only exception in that rich\ndataset, chemical effects appear the more plausible explanation. The fact that we see C$_2$H at the earliest and the later evolutionary\nstages can be explained by the reactive nature of C$_2$H: it is\nproduced quickly early on and gets replenished at the core edges by\nthe UV photodissociation of CO. The inner ``chemical'' hole observed\ntoward IRAS\\,18089-1732 can be explained by C$_2$H being consumed in\nthe chemical network forming CO and more complex molecules like larger\ncarbon-hydrogen complexes and/or depletion. The data show that C$_2$H is not suited to investigate the central gas\ncores in more evolved sources, however, our analysis indicates that\nC$_2$H may be a suitable tracer of the earliest stages of (massive)\nstar formation, like N$_2$H$^+$ or NH$_3$ (e.g.,\n\\citealt{bergin2002,tafalla2004,beuther2005a,pillai2006}). While a\nspatial analysis of the line emission will give insights into the\nkinematics of the gas and also the evolutionary stage from chemical\nmodels, multiple C$_2$H lines will even allow a temperature\ncharacterization. With its lowest $J=1-0$ transitions around 87\\,GHz,\nC$_2$H has easily accessible spectral lines in several bands between\nthe 3\\,mm and 850\\,$\\mu$m.

      "D) The specific-heat ratio primarily affects the magnitude of entropy production, but its influence on the relative contributions of NOMF and NOEF is negligible."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "In the first stage (t < 0.03), cases with different specific-heat ratios show various trends. At the stage where the bubble deformation is not very large, i.e., 0.03 < t < 0.06, values of ṠNOEF fluctuate near the average value. In the third stage (t > 0.06), evolutions of ṠNOEF in cases with larger specific-heat ratios show an apparent growing tendency. Differently, the values of ṠNOEF in cases with smaller specific-heat ratios remain almost unchanged. The influence of specific heat ratio on the ṠNOEF , similar with the effect on NOEF, is also affected by the heat conductivity and the temperature gradient. It can be seen that, except for the case of γ = 1.09, the larger the specific-heat ratio, the higher entropy production rate ṠNOEF . The temporal evolutions of ṠNOEF of case γ = 1.09 and case γ = 1.12 are very similar. Consequently, the specific-heat ratio increases the ṠNOEF by raising the temperature gradient. Further understanding can be seen in Fig. , where the entropy productions over this period are plotted. For convenience, the sum and difference between S NOMF and S NOEF are also plotted in the figure. The variation range of S NOEF is larger than that of S NOMF . It indicates that the influence of specific-heat ratio on S NOEF is more significant than that on S NOMF . Effects of specific-heat ratio on entropy production caused by NOMF and NOEF are contrary. Specifically, it can be seen that the entropy production contributed by NOMF increases with re- duced specific-heat ratio. But the entropy production caused by NOEF first reduces with decreasing specific-heat ratio and then approaches to a saturation value. The S NOEF in case γ = 1.09 is almost the same with it in case γ = 1.12. When the specificheat ratio γ is smaller than a threshold value γ c (γ c ≈ 1.315), the entropy production induced by NOEF is more significant than that caused by NOMF. However, in the case of γ > γ c , the situation reverses. The temporal evolution of the total entropy production (S NOMF +S NOEF ) is similar to the S NOEF profile."

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "documentation": [
      "In DBM modeling, the CE multiscale analysis is used to determine quickly the reserved kinetic moments. Specifically, when constructing a DBM which only the first order term of Kn number is retained (i.e., only the first order TNE effects are retained), seven kinetic moments should be reserved, i.e., the M 0 , M 1 , M 2,0 , M 2 , M 3,1 , M 3 , M 4,2 . Two more kinetic moments ( M 4 and M 5,3 ) are needed when the second order TNE is considered . However, it should be noted that the function of CE analysis in DBM modeling is only to determine the kinetic moments that need to be preserved. Whether or not to derive the hydrodynamic equations does not affect the DBM simulation. The kinetic moments used in our physical modeling are shown in the Appendix B. Their expressions can be obtained by integrating v and η with continuous-form f eq . For better understanding, the Appendix C gives the two-fluid hydrodynamic equations recovered from the Boltzmann equation. The kinetic moments in Appendix B can be written in matrix form, i.e., C • f σ ,eq = fσ,eq , (\nwhere C is the matrix of discrete velocity and feq represents the kinetic moments. A proper discrete velocity model is needed to confirm the values of f σ ,eq i . The f σ ,eq can be obtained by solving the inverse matrix, i.e., f σ ,eq = C −1 • fσ,eq , where C −1 is the inverse matrix of C. It is very convenient to obtain the inverse matrix of C through some mathematical softwares such as Mathematica, etc. The D2V16 model is chosen in this paper, its sketches can be seen in Fig. . The specific values of D2V16 are given in the following equations: where \"cyc\" indicates cyclic permutation and c is an adjustable parameter of the discrete velocity model. The sketch of η in D2V16 is η i = η 0 for i = 1 − 4, and η i = 0 for i = 5 − 16. Checking the TNE state and extracting TNE information\n\nMany physical quantities can characterize the degree of TNE in a fluid system, such as relaxation time, Kn number, viscosity, heat conduction, the gradients of macroscopic quantity, etc."

      "For a long response with small time steps, the time domain methods are very costly in computational time. Volterra series is another widely used method, which is the extension of the Duhamel integral for linear systems . Volterra series can reproduce many nonlinear phenomena, but they are very complex due to higher-dimensional convolution integrals . Since 1980's, significant progress has been made in the general area of the Volterra series. The reader is referred to Ref. for a quite thorough literature review on the relevant topics. After 2017, most papers focus on Volterra series identification. De Paula and Marques proposed a method for the identification of Volterra kernels, which was based on time-delay neural networks. Son and Kim presented a method for a direct estimation of the Volterra kernel coefficients. Dalla Libera et al. introduced two new kernels for Volterra series identification. Peng et al. used the measured response to identify the kernel function and performed the nonlinear structural damage detection. Only a few papers concentrated on simplifying the computation of convolution integrals. Traditional methods for computing convolution integrals involved in the Volterra series have been performed in three distinct domains: time, frequency and Laplace. The time domain method based on Volterra series refers to discrete time convolution methods, which also suffer computational cost problems . Both the frequency domain method and the Laplace domain method based on the Volterra series consist of three steps: (1) Volterra series are transformed into an algebraic equation in the frequency domain or Laplace domain; the algebraic equation is solved by purely algebraic manipulations; and (3) the solution in Step ( ) is transformed back to the time domain. Many researchers have used the frequency domain method to compute the responses of nonlinear systems. Billings et al. developed a new method for identifying the generalized frequency response function (GFRF) of nonlinear systems and then predicted the nonlinear response based on these GFRFs."

      "Hyperplane arrangements have been used by Vincent and Schwager in the context of Neural Network verification. In our setting, we leverage this representation to define path preferences as preferred transitions between adjacent regions of the space. Hyperplane Arrangement\n\nWe assume a two-dimensional environment composed of m polytopic obstacles, each defined by their half-space representation (H-representation) where A i ∈ R di×2 and b i ∈ R di , and where d i is the number of edges (hyperplanes) composing polytope i. Let n = i d i be the total number of hyperplanes. We leverage each obstacle's H-representation to construct a hyperplane arrangement of the environment as shown in fig.\n.e. a partitioning of the space into polytopes. More specifically, each location in space belongs to a polytope j for which we can write an H-representation of the form where α j i ∈ {−1, 1} di is a vector specific to polytope j and obstacle i corresponding to the relative position of any point in the set with respect to each hyperplane in O i . Fig. : Intent inference model in a hyperplane arrangement of the obstacle free space. We spatially decompose the preference θ into a set of preferred neighboring polytopes per region of the space. Within each polytope j, the human preference pj is a discrete distribution over the preferred neighbor in N (j). We assume that for a location st belonging to polytope j, and given goal g and preference pj, the observation ot and any other preference p i,i =j are conditionally independent. Concatenating elements from each obstacle's Hrepresentation, we can write polytope j's H-representation as where Some of the constraints in eq. ( ) (corresponding to rows of A, b and α j ) are redundant, i.e. the set P j does not change upon their removal. We can further reduce the Hrepresentation of a polytope to include only non-redundant constraints. By removing the rows corresponding to redundant constraints, we obtain new matrices A j e , b j e and α j e such that we can write the polytope's reduced H-representation as The non-redundant constraints correspond to edges of the polytope."

      "Kenneth Hammond didn’t make it back to his Knoxville, Tenn., home. He had a seizure after picking up prescriptions for 540 pills and died in an Ocala gas station parking lot. Keith Konkol didn’t make it back to Tennessee, either. His body was dumped on the side of a remote South Carolina road after he overdosed in the back seat of a car the same day of his clinic visit. He had collected eight prescriptions totaling 720 doses of oxycodone, methadone, Soma and Xanax. Konkol had every reason to believe he would get those prescriptions: In three previous visits to the Plantation clinic, he had picked up prescriptions for 1,890 pills. An estimated 60 percent of her patients were from out of state, a former medical assistant told the DEA. In 2015, Averill pleaded not guilty to eight manslaughter charges. She is awaiting trial in Broward County. Averill was just one doctor at just one clinic. In 2010, the year Averill’s patients overdosed, Florida received applications to open 1,026 more pain clinics. An online message board advising drug users summed it up: “Just go anywhere in South Florida and look for a ‘pain management clinic.’ It shouldn’t be too hard; you can’t swing a dead cat without hitting one.” Complain about anything from a back injury to a hangnail, it advised, “and they’ll set you right up.” By this time, Kentucky had reined in its pill mills. It didn’t matter, Ohio, Delaware, North Carolina, Connecticut acted as well, but other state’s efforts didn’t matter either, Florida continued ignoring the pill mills and rogue doctors feeding the nation’s oxycodone habit, the pills flowed. “There were folks down there, where if I had an opportunity to, get my hands around their throat, I would have wrung their neck,” said Huntington Mayor Steve Williams. On Florida’s inaction he stated, “There was total evidence as to what was happening. It lays at the foot, in my opinion, of the public officials there that allowed it to continue on.” Governor Jeb Bush Backed A Solution\nOne of the first dinners Florida Gov. Jeb Bush hosted after moving into the governor’s mansion in 1999 was a small one."

    "question": "Given the challenges of working with \"undevelopable\" surfaces and the need for precise shaping, what is the primary reason the fuselage longerons take on an elliptical shape during construction?",

      "A) The longerons are intentionally shaped elliptically to improve aerodynamic efficiency.",
      "B) The use of plywood, which is a developable material, necessitates a cylindrical shape for the fuselage.",
      "C) The process of \"tumbling home\" the side panels, combined with the conical shape of the fuselage, results in an elliptical shape for the longerons when cut.",
      "D) The elliptical shape of the longerons is a byproduct of the marine-inspired construction techniques used in the aircraft."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "Second, understand that the dimensions called for in the plans put a twist in the sides that tends to work the panel in two directions of curvature. This twist makes the panel \"undevelopable\" meaning that that shape cannot be unrolled into an equivalent flat shape. This is important when laying out the side and bottom panels onto flat plywood. To illustrate this, try forming a piece of paper around a soda can. The paper can be formed flat around the can either straight or at a diagonal to it's length. It has only one direction of curvature and is by definition \"developable\". Now try to form the same piece of paper around a baseball. It won't lie flat on the surface without some deformation (folding, wrinkling or tearing) of the paper. The ball has curvature in more that one direction and is a \"compounded\" shape. Paper (or plywood) can only be readily formed in developable shapes as opposed to aluminum or other metal which can accept in plane deformation. A developable surface is needed to lay out a curved surface when the materials used can't be deformed with any degree of in-plane strain. Initially, the fuselage sides are laid out flat with reference to the top longeron measured to a straight chalk line. The bowing problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. If the sides were not sloped (tumbled home) , the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. Since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is now conical. When a conical shape is cut with a plane (building surface) not perpendicular to it's axis, the shape formed is elliptical -- exactly what happens with the top longeron. When it's built flat, bent to form a cylindrical section, and sloped to form a conical section, it takes on an elliptical shape firewall to tailstock. This method borrows heavily from proven techniques used in the marine trades. It should be stressed at this point that although the layout procedure is not complicated, it is important to take your time."

      "Jacobo survives and swears revenge. Ngotho loses his job and Njoroge’s family is forced to move. Njoroge’s brothers fund his education and seem to lose respect for their father. Mwihaki, Jacobo's daughter and Njoroge's best friend, enters a girls' only boarding school, leaving Njoroge relatively alone. He reflects upon her leaving, and realizes that he was embarrassed by his father's actions towards Jacobo. For this reason, Njoroge is not upset by her exit and their separation. Njoroge switches to another school. For a time, everyone's attention is focused on the upcoming trial of Jomo Kenyatta – a revered leader of the movement. Many blacks think that he is going to bring forth Kenya’s independence. But Jomo loses the trial and is imprisoned. This results in further protests and greater suppression of the black population. Jacobo and a white landowner, Mr. Howlands, fight against the rising activities of the Mau Mau, an organization striving for Kenyan economic, political, and cultural independence. Jacobo accuses Ngotho of being the leader of the Mau Mau and tries to imprison the whole family. Meanwhile, the situation in the country is deteriorating. Six black men are taken out of their houses and executed in the woods. One day Njoroge meets Mwihaki again, who has returned from boarding school. Although Njoroge had planned to avoid her due to the conflict between their fathers, their friendship is unaffected. Njoroge passes an important exam that allows him to advance to High School. His village is proud of him, and collects money to pay Njoroge's High School tuition. Several months later, Jacobo is murdered in his office by a member of the Mau Mau. Mr. Howlands has Njoroge removed from school for questioning. Both father and son are brutally beaten before release and Ngotho is left barely alive. Although there doesn't seem to be a connection between Njoroge's family and the murder, it is eventually revealed that Njoroge's brothers are behind the assassination, and that Boro is the real leader of the Mau Mau."

Her dad spent most of that time with her, talking to her and trying to calm her down. After an hour, I asked him if he could please tell her to be more quiet because the other members of the household were trying to go to sleep. My question is....how do I as the girlfriend, handle this? He did not like that I asked her to be quiet. We have a rule that if she is having bad behavior, and can't calm down in 5 minutes, he takes her out of the house because her yelling doesn't stop for a long time and is very upsetting to everyone in the household. I would like to ask him to do this with this kind of situation as well. Is this a reasonable request? His thought was that she shouldn't be made to calm down, because everyone handles being upset in a different way. But, she was literally sobbing and wailing very loudly. My other question is should she have been told that if she wouldn't have lied, this wouldn't have happened? She has a history of lying and of not accepting responsibility for her actions. My boyfriend became very upset with me when I brought this up. He was being very sympathetic and understanding to her.

But, that being said, most of them usually work for a period of time to prevent the targeted diseases. The basic science behind vaccines is correct. Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared? In the case of the routine childhood diseases, this was a bad thing, but it is a true thing. Vaccines usually don't cause any obvious reactions. While they usually prevent the diseases, and that's why people continue to get them. With the increasing vaccination schedule, more and more are severely and permanently damaged, and it is immoral to mandate any vaccine for anyone for this reason. But it would also be immoral to prohibit vaccines for those who want them enough to take the risk. Your article said as though it had any probative value that 90% of those who get pertussis had been vaxxed. The old DPT vaccine was MUCH more effective at preventing pertussis, but it was so dangerous (again, not to most, but to many), that developed countries replaced it with the acellular version, DTaP. From the beginning about twenty years ago, it was clear that it was not very effective and that huge numbers of vaxxed people got pertussis anyway, including my daughter who got pertussis at eight month old after having gotten three DTaPs."

    "documentation": [
      "Libertarians do not necessarily accept that this argument shows that we do not have free will, and the reason, or at least a big part of it, should not surprise anyone at this point: they simply define free will differently. According to libertarians, such as Robert Nozick and Robert Kane, one has free will if one could have acted otherwise than one did, and if indeterminism is true, then it may be true that we could have “acted” differently than we did under the exact same circumstances, and that we thereby might have free will in this sense. It should be pointed out, though, that critics of libertarianism are“rightly skeptical about the relevance of this kind of free will. First of all, the free will that libertarians endorse is, unlike what many libertarians seem to think, not an ethically relevant kind of freedom, and it does not have anything to do with the freedom of action that we by definition want. Second, the hard incompatibilist is right that no matter what is true about the degree to which the universe is deterministic, our actions are still caused by prior causes ultimately beyond our own control, which few of those who identify themselves as libertarians seem to want to acknowledge. And lastly, the fact that our actions are caused by causes ultimately beyond our own control does, if we truly appreciated, undermine our intuition of retributive justice, an intuition that libertarians generally seem to want to defend intellectually. So, as many have pointed out already, libertarians are simply on a failed mission. Together with the want to defend retributive blame and punishment, what seems to be the main motivation for people who defend a libertarian notion of free will seems to be a fear of predeterminism, a fear of there being just one possible outcome from the present state of the universe, which would imply that we ultimately cannot do anything to cause a different outcome than the one possible. Libertarians and others with the same fear have artfully tried to make various models to help them overcome this fear, for instance so-called two-stage models that propose that our choices consist of an indeterministic stage of generation of possible actions, and then our non-random choice of one of them."

      "In training, we use the MSE loss between the degraded image and the output of the network, and we optimize the loss using the ADAM optimizer and a learning rate equal to 0.01 . In our experiments, we also used α = 0.15 as an optimal proportion coefficient for reconstruction loss. Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we introduced a novel framework for contour completion using deep structure priors (DSP). This work offers a novel notion of a maskless grouping of fragmented contours. In our proposed framework, we introduced a novel loss metric that does not require a strict definition of the mask. Instead, it lets the model learn the perceivable illusory contours and connects those fragmented pieces using a generator network that is solely trained on just the single incomplete input image. Our model does not require any pre-training which demonstrates that the convolutional architecture of the hour-glass model is able to connect disconnected contours. We present an extended set of experiments that show the capability of our algorithm. We investigate the effect of each parameter introduced in our algorithm separately and show how one could possibly achieve the best result for their problem using this model. In future work, we plan to extend this model and try to see how it performs with real images. In particular, we want to determine whether we can inpaint real-world photographs while retaining perceptually aware scene structures. The importance of shape in perception by deep neural networks has been highlighted in many adversarial examples to appearance-based networks . The outcome of this work has strong potential to impact the designing and implementation of models that are robust to such perturbations."

      "We changed her diet and tried getting her involved with activities but she is anti-social and prefers reading than being social. She is terrified of change even in daily routine (even that will trigger prolonged crying). It frustrates me because I don't know what else to do with her behavior. I've tried acupuncture (she refused at the first session); she refuses massage too. She is an honor-roll student at school and has very minimal issues at school but if she has had a bad day it does result in a tantrum or crying and defiance. How can I get her tested for Asperger's Syndrome? Last night our 24 year old son with Aspergers told his dad and I that he is pulling out of the 4 college classes that he recetnly enrolled in because he has not been attending class or turning in his assignments. He paid $2800 (his own money) for tuition and I reminded him of this when he told us but it did not seem to bother him. This is the 3rd time he has started college courses and has not completed them. (He also took some concurrent college classes while he was in high school that he failed). This is a son who basically had a 4.0 grade point average through 10th grade and got a 34 on the ACT the first time he took it. With the news that he was once again not sticking with college courses I did not sleep well. When I got up this mornning I began looking online for help in how to deal with his situation. I found your \"Launching Adult Children With Aspergers\" and purchased it. Most of what is included are things we have done or did with our son throughout his life. I was hoping for more help so I am emailing you now in hopes of more specific ideas. We noticed some things with our son, Taylor, as a yound child but as we had not heard of Aspergers at that time we just did what we thought would help him. As a toddler and a child at pre-school he generally went off on his own to play. When I talked to his pre-school teacher about my concerns (that I was worried he would end up a hermit) she said she did not see him being a loner and that he seemed to interact fine with others in many situations."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "Indonesia is the world’s largest shark fishing nation [9, 14], and a global priority for shark conservation . Until recently Indonesia’s shark fishery has largely functioned as de facto open-access [12, 16]. However, in the past five years the Indonesian government has demonstrated a clear commitment to shark conservation and resource management, with domestic measures put in place to implement international obligations under CITES . Exploitation of all CITES-listed species is now regulated, either through full species protection or export controls (these species are hereafter referred to as ‘regulated’ species). However, CITES only affords protection to a small number of Indonesia’s 112 known shark species , of which 83 are threatened with extinction according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (i.e. Vulnerable (VU), Endangered (EN) or Critically Endangered (CR) , these species are hereafter referred to as ‘threatened’ species), many of which continue to be landed throughout the country . Further, these policy measures predominantly regulate trade at the point of export, but do not necessarily influence fisher behaviour or local demand at the point of catch, such that the ‘trickle-down’ impacts on species mortality are unknown. In addition, effectively implementing species-specific shark mortality controls remains challenging due to the non-selectivity of fishing gears, and practical and cultural barriers to changing fisher preferences for certain gear-types and fishing methods. As such, existing regulations alone (e.g. Indonesian Law on Fisheries 31/2004 and its derivative regulations) will likely be insufficient to curb mortality of threatened and regulated species, as fishers must be both willing and able to change their fishing behaviour . Moreover, most of Indonesia’s shark fisheries are small-scale, and in relatively poor coastal communities where there are often no legal, sustainable marine-based alternatives to shark fishing that offer similar financial returns [22, 23]."

      "\\section{Introduction}\n\nUltracold neutral plasmas studied in the laboratory offer access to a regime of plasma physics that scales to describe thermodynamic aspects of important high-energy-density systems, including strongly coupled astrophysical plasmas \\cite{VanHorn,Burrows}, as well as terrestrial sources of neutrons \\cite{Hinton,Ichimaru_fusion,Atzeni,Boozer} and x-ray radiation \\cite{Rousse,Esarey}. Yet, under certain conditions, low-temperature laboratory plasmas evolve with dynamics that are governed by the quantum mechanical properties of their constituent particles, and in some cases by coherence with an external electromagnetic field. The relevance of ultracold plasmas to such a broad scope of problems in classical and quantum many-body physics has given rise to a great deal of experimental and theoretical research on these systems since their discovery in the late 90s. A series of reviews affords a good overview of progress in the last twenty years \\cite{Gallagher,Killian_Science,PhysRept,Lyon}. Here, we focus on the subset of ultracold neutral plasmas that form via kinetic rate processes from state-selected Rydberg gases, and emphasize in particular the distinctive dynamics found in the evolution of molecular ultracold plasmas. While molecular beam investigations of threshold photoionization spectroscopy had uncovered relevant effects a few years earlier \\cite{Scherzer,Alt}, the field of ultracold plasma physics began in earnest with the 1999 experiment of Rolston and coworkers on metastable xenon atoms cooled in a magneto optical trap (MOT) \\cite{Killian}. This work and many subsequent efforts tuned the photoionization energy as a means to form a plasma of very low electron temperature built on a strongly coupled cloud of ultracold ions. Experiment and theory soon established that fast processes associated with disorder-induced heating and longer-time electron-ion collisional rate processes act to elevate the ion temperatures to around one degree Kelvin, and constrain the effective initial electron temperature to a range above 30 K \\cite{Kuzmin,Hanson,Laha}."

      "The time-varying positions of the $n$-th vehicle is given by $\\mathrm{p}_{n,t}=[{x}_{n,t},{y}_{n,t}]$ where $n \\in N$. Among the $K$ orthogonal subchannels available for the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications, RSU assigns one V2I link to each vehicle. Each vehicle exchanges messages composed of the vehicle's state (i.e., position and velocity) with RSU through the $k$-th V2I link by transmitting a signal $\\textrm{x}_{t,k}$ carrying those messages at each time instant $t$ where $k \\in K$. We consider a reactive RSJ that aims to attack the V2I link by injecting intentional interference to the communication link between vehicles and RSU to alter the transmitted signals by the vehicles. In contrast, the RSS purposes to mislead the vehicles by spoofing the GPS signal and so registering wrong GPS positions. RSU aims to detect both the spoofer on the satellite link and the jammer on multiple V2I links in order to take effective actions and protect the vehicular network. The joint GPS spoofing and jamming detection problem can be formulated as the following ternary hypothesis test:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{cases}\n        \\mathcal{H}_{0}: \\mathrm{z}_{t,k} = \\mathrm{g}_{t,k}^{nR} \\mathrm{x}_{t,k} + \\mathrm{v}_{t,k}, \\\\\n        \\mathcal{H}_{1}: \\mathrm{z}_{t,k} = \\mathrm{g}_{t,k}^{nR} \\mathrm{x}_{t,k} + \\mathrm{g}_{t,k}^{JR} \\mathrm{x}_{t,k}^{j} + \\mathrm{v}_{t,k}, \\\\\n        \\mathcal{H}_{2}: \\mathrm{z}_{t,k} = \\mathrm{g}_{t,k}^{nR} \\mathrm{x}_{t,k}^{*} + \\mathrm{v}_{t,k},\n    \\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{H}_{0}$, $\\mathcal{H}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{H}_{2}$ denote three hypotheses corresponding to the absence of both jammer and spoofer, the presence of the jammer, and the presence of the spoofer, respectively. $\\textrm{z}_{t,k}$ is the received signal at the RSU at $t$ over the $k$-th V2I link, $\\textrm{g}_{t,k}^{nR}$ is the channel power gain from vehicle $n$ to the RSU formulated as: $\\textrm{g}_{t,k}^{nR} = \\alpha_{t,k}^{nR} \\mathrm{h}_{t,k}^{nR}$, where $\\alpha_{t,k}^{nR}$ is the large-scale fading including path-loss and shadowing modeled as \\cite{8723178}: $\\alpha_{t,k}^{nR}=G\\beta d_{t,nR}^{-\\gamma}$.\n\\begin{figure}[t!]"

      "The proximity of SC gives rise to two further exchange mechanisms that\ndetermine the system's behavior. First of all, the (conventional)\n\\emph{RKKY interaction} appears, $J \\sim \\GS{}^2$ \\cite{RK,K,Y}. Moreover, the \\emph{CAR exchange} emerges as a consequence of finite $\\GS{}$ \\cite{Yao}. It can be understood on the basis \nof perturbation theory as follows. DQD in the inter-dot singlet state may absorb\nand re-emit a Cooper pair approaching from SC; see \\fig{system}(e)-(g). As a second-order\nprocess, it reduces the energy of the singlet, which is the ground state of isolated DQD. A similar process is not possible in the triplet state due to spin conservation. Therefore, the singlet-triplet energy splitting $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is increased (or generated for $t=J=0$). More precisely, the leading ($2$nd-order in $t$ and $\\GS{}$) terms\nin the total exchange are \n\\begin{equation}\nJ^{\\mathrm{eff}} \t\\approx \tJ + \\frac{4t^2}{U-U'+\\frac{3}{4}J} + \\frac{4\\GS{}^2}{U+U'+\\frac{3}{4}J}. \\label{Jeff}\n\\end{equation}\nUsing this estimation, one can predict $T^*$ for finite $\\GS{}$, $t$ and $J$ with \\eq{Tstar}. Apparently, from three contributions corresponding to:\n(i) RKKY interaction, (ii) direct exchange and (iii) CAR exchange, only the first may bear a negative (ferromagnetic) sign. The two other contributions always have an anti-ferromagnetic nature. More accurate expression for $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is derived in Appendix~\\ref{sec:downfolding} [see \\eq{A_J}] by the Hamiltonian down-folding procedure. The relevant terms differ \nby factors important only for large $\\GS{}/U$. Finally, it seems worth stressing that normal leads are not necessary for CAR exchange to occur. At least one of them is inevitable for the Kondo screening though, and two symmetrically coupled \nnormal leads allow for measurement of the normal conductance. It is also noteworthy that inter-dot Coulomb interactions\ndecrease the energy of intermediate states contributing to direct exchange [\\fig{system}(c)], while increasing the energy of intermediate\nstates causing the CAR exchange [\\fig{system}(f)]."

On August 1, 2006, the station announced that it would be the new flagship station for the Minnesota Twins baseball team, effective with the start of the 2007 season. The Twins had been on rival WCCO since arriving in Minnesota in 1961. KSTP served as the flagship for the Twins until the end of the 2012 season, when games moved to 96.3 KTWN-FM (now KMWA). The Twins have since returned to WCCO 830. The switch to a fairly weak FM station caused dissent among some listeners, particularly in communities that had trouble picking up KSTP 1500. Although KSTP is the state's second most powerful AM station, it must operate directionally at night, delivering a reduced signal to parts of the market. WCCO, by comparison, offers a signal with a wider coverage area during the day than KSTP does, with WCCO's non-directional 50,000 watt signal. In response, the Twins have expanded the number of affiliates. On March 9, 2011, KSTP announced it would be the new flagship for the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers men's and women's basketball and men's ice hockey, ending a 68-year run on WCCO. The rights have since moved to KFXN-FM, which already aired Gopher football. On March 2, 2017, KSTP announced it would be the first radio broadcaster for Minnesota United FC.

      "D) It enables the robot hand to perform a wider range of precision grips by adjusting the grasp size."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "documentation": [
      "Using this framework we are able to control the hand during different grasp types using only one variable, the grasp size, which we define as the distance between the tip of the thumb and the index finger. Instead of controlling the finger limbs independently, our controller generates control signals for all the hand joints in a (lowdimensional) shared space (i.e.\nsynergy space). In addition, our approach is modular, which allows to execute various types of precision grips, by changing the synergy space according to the type of grasp. We show that our controller is able to lift objects of various weights and materials, adjust the grasp configuration during changes in the object's weight, and perform object placements and object handovers. INTRODUCTION\n\nTo perform complex manipulation tasks in unstructured environments, humans use tactile feedback from their fingers. This feedback is provided by tactile afferents located in the skin of the hand. Particularly, for handling small objects with precise movements, the afferents located in the fingertips are used, which have high density and adapt fast to pressure changes . These afferents provide information about the characteristics of the exerted contact forces, such as the magnitude and the direction. For anthropomorphic robots to be able to perform dexterous tasks similar force feedback signals must be used to alleviate problems arising from uncertainty in measurements, and handle external perturbations. For example, using open-loop position control to lift a heavy object may fail due to slip without any feedback mechanism to provide tactile information. Previous works have used tactile sensors to design force controllers that use slip prediction to update the desired normal forces applied by the fingertips. The slip predictors are based on machine learning models such as neural networks and random forests to classify multi-modal signals from a tactile sensor. In all previous works, each finger was separately controlled by an independent force controller."

Results on DIMACS Graphs\n\nWe tested the implementation of each team on the DIMACS instances to gauge the performance of the conflict optimizer on other classes of graphs. We compared our results to the best known bounds and to the state of the art coloring algorithms HEAD and QACOL . The time limit for Lasa's algorithms is 1 hour. CWLS is Lasa's conflict optimizer with the neighbourhood presented in TABUCOL , while PWLS is the optimizer with the neighbourhood presented in PARTIALCOL . Gitastrophe algorithm ran 10 minutes after which the number of colors no longer decreases. Shadoks algorithm ran for 1 hour without the BDFS option (results with BDFS are worse). Results are presented in Table . We only kept the difficult DIMACS instances. For the other instances, all the results match the best known bounds. The DIMACS instances had comparatively few edges (on the order of thousands or millions); the largest intersection graphs considered in the CG:SHOP challenge had over 1.5 billion edges. We notice that the conflict optimizer works extremely poorly on random graphs, but it is fast and appears to perform well on geometric graphs (r250.5, r1000.1c, r1000.5, dsjr500.1c and dsjr500.5), matching the best-known results . Interestingly, these geometric graphs are not intersection graphs as in the CG:SHOP challenge, but are generated based on a distance threshold. On the DIMACS graphs, Lasa implementation shows better performance than the other implementations."

      "But in the case of the most dangerous diseases, everyone should learn about them and think about what he wants to do to protect himself and his children from them, considering all the factors involved. And no one can have 100% certainty that he has made the right decision, but that's life. But if you live in the Congo and many people around you are currently dying of yellow fever, then that means that you yourself are at risk of being bitten by a loaded mosquito and getting, often dying, of yellow fever. The yellow fever vaccine is very effective at preventing yellow fever. From there, each person must make a choice. At the end of this stage there is a remission of two or three days. About 80% of those with clinical disease recover at this point, with permanent immunity. The other 20% enter the toxic stage, with a return of the fever, black vomit (coffee-ground emesis), diarrhea, a slowing of the pulse (Faget's sign), jaundice, yellow eyes, yellow skin, and failure of the kidneys, liver, and heart. The patient gets a strange hiccup (like with Ebola, a related disease), falls into a coma, and dies. About half of those patients who enter the toxic stage dies, even now, even with the best of hospital care. The Faget's sign can also occur at the end of the first stage. You asked specifically about the symptoms of the Americans on Dr. Reed's team who got yellow fever in Cuba in 1900. I'll give the passage from The American Plague (162-5), which describes the course of Jesse Lazear's illness. \"In his logbook, Lazear wrote an unusual entry on September 13. In all cases before those, page after page of records, Lazear had used the soldier's name and simply the date he was bitten, with no other attention to the mosquito. A one-line entry with a name and a date. On that day, however, in his elegant hand, Lazear did not write the soldier's name, but instead wrote 'Guinea Pig No. 1.' He went on to write that this guinea pig had been bitten by a mosquito that developed from an egg laid by a mosquito that developed from an egg laid by a mosquito that fed on a number of yellow fever cases: Suarez, Hernández, De Long, Ferández."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "This circuit architecture is commonly used to simulate the time evolution of a quantum many-body system, until some time t, with controllable precision , and we will use it to benchmark the denoiser. In practice, we cannot directly implement a supercircuit, and so we have to utilize its interpretation as an ensemble of circuits. Essentially, after executing a shot of the noisy circuit we sample the denoiser and apply it. The goal is to construct the denoiser in a way that averaging over many of its samples cancels the accumulated errors and gives us a good approximation of the noiseless expectation values. It should be noted that our approach requires more gate applications on the quantum processor than with the gate-wise scheme, since there each sample from the mitigation quasiprobability distribution can be absorbed into the original circuit, whereas our approach increases the circuit depth. We take this into account by imposing the same noise on the denoiser. Furthermore, within our scheme, the dimensionality of the quasiprobabilistic mitigating ensemble can be controlled, in contrast to the gate-wise approach where it is equal to the gate count. To facilitate the stochastic interpretation we parameterize each two-qubit denoiser channel G i as a sum of CPTP maps, such that we can sample the terms in this sum and execute the sampled gate on the quantum processor. Concretely, we use a trace preserv-ing sum of a unitary and a non-unitary channel. For the unitary part we take a two-qubit unitary channel U( φ i ) = U ( φ i ) ⊗ U * ( φ i ), with U ( φ i ) a two-qubit unitary gate parameterized by φ i . For this we take the two-qubit ZZ rotation exp(−iα(σ z ⊗ σ z )) with angle α, which can be obtained from native gates on current hardware , and dress it with four general one-qubit unitaries, only two of which are independent if we want a circuit that is space inversion symmetric around every bond. The resulting gate has 7 real parameters φ i . For the non-unitary part, which is essential because D has to cancel the non-unitary accumulated noise to obtain the noiseless unitary circuit, we use a general onequbit measurement followed by conditional preparation channel M( , with V a general one-qubit unitary and each κ i a 3-dimensional vector, resulting in a real 9-dimensional ζ i ."

      "\\section{Activity Recognition}\nWe aim to detect single wrist-worn ACC sensor based hand gesture and postural activities and insert these into an HDBN graphical model in conjunction with ambient and object sensor values for complex activity recognition. We consider the recognition problem asan activity tupple of $\\langle gesture,posture,ambient,object \\rangle$. Though, Alam et. al. provides significant performance improvement for single wrist-worn ACC sensor aided 18-hand gesture based postural activity recognition in lab environment \\cite{alam17}, it faces some practical challenges in real-time smart environment with older adults due to the diversity of their postures. For example, some older adults use walker, double walking sticks or wheel chair for walking in which cases collecting 18 hand gestures and corresponding postural activities for training requires endless efforts and carefulness. To reduce the complexity of ground truth labeling and later state space explosion for graphical model (HDBN), we propose to use rotational normalization method that can merge some hand-gestures subject to directional differences and forms an 8-hand gesture model. However, our proposed Feature Weight Naive Bayes (FWNB) classifier adds significant improvement on Alam et. al. proposed sparse-deconvolution method as well as recognition in diverse postural environment. \\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\begin{center}\n   \\epsfig{file=hand_gestures.pdf,height=0.5in, width=3in}\n   \\vspace{-.2in}\n\\caption{8 hand gesture dictionary with direction}\n   \\label{fig:hand_gestures}\n   \\vspace{-.2in}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\\subsection{Hand Gesture Recognition}\n\\label{sec:hand_gesture}\n\\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposes an 8-gesture dictionary (as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:hand_gestures}) and a Feature Weighted Naive Bayesian (FWNB) framework for building, modeling and recognizing hand gestures.

BLITZER: What's taking so long? Why haven't you been able to meet with Gadhafi yet? WELDON: Well, it -- that's not unusual. I mean all three of the delegation trips that I led here in 2003 and 2004 -- or, actually, 2004 and 2005 -- they always make you wait until 30 minutes before the meeting and then you go. And some of those meetings were at 10:00 at night, some were at 5:00 in the afternoon. As you know from the excellent reporting being done by your folks here, there's a lot of security concerns, and they are very concerned where Gadhafi is at any given moment. That's one of the issues, but we have been making ourselves available. We have been doing a lot of back-channel meetings with friends and associates that I have here, and we have met with the chief of staff and one of the sons, and today with the prime minister, a very lengthy meeting for two hours. So, we're going to give them until tomorrow. We're not going to stay beyond that. And we have given them some suggestions, and we expect a response by midday tomorrow. And if we don't, we will done exit conversation with your people and let you know our feelings.\nBLITZER: What's the major headline that you got out of these meetings with other leaders? I take it you met with Saif Al-Islam Gadhafi, one of the sons of Moammar Gadhafi. What are they saying to you? WELDON: Well, we actually didn't meet with Saif. I have met with Saif probably 10 times over the past seven years, both in America and here in Libya. I have not yet met with Saif. I have offered, if he is available. I have met with Saadi.

Numerical values of excitation poles and residues for different cases are listed in Table . Table : Parameter values, poles and residues of the sinusoidal excitation Substituting poles and residues of the excitation, as well as those of the system into Eqs.\n20 and 19, response coefficients β p i ,k corresponding to system poles −a i and response coefficients γ p i ,ℓ corresponding to excitation poles λ ℓ are calculated, respectively. According to Eq. 22, the first three orders of responses for each case in Table are calculated. Figures )-15(a) show the comparison of responses obtained by the proposed method and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with ∆t = 10 −4 . For Cases 1 and 2, the first-order responses agree well with the total responses obtained by the Runge-Kutta method, and the higher-order responses only slightly improve the transient parts. For Cases 3-5, the sum of the first three orders of responses is in good agreement with the Runge-Kutta solution. When the response nonlinearity increases, higher-order responses need to be considered. In other words, the proposed method can accurately compute the nonlinear responses by choosing a small number N of Volterra series terms. Figures )-15(b) show the contributions of the three response components for the five cases. In each case, the first-order response is the most dominant component, and the contributions of secondand third-order responses are much less than those of the first-order response. Especially for Cases 1 and 2, whose excitation frequencies are far from the linear natural frequency, second-and thirdorder responses are close to zero. This may be because the QFRF and CFRF approach zero when the frequency is larger than 4 rad/s (see Figs. ). Furthermore, the mean values of the first-order responses are approximately zero, and those of the second-order responses are always smaller than zero, which are the difference frequency components in Eq. 27."

    "documentation": [
      "To optimize the use of human input and quickly infer the human's preference, Fig. : An autonomous robot navigates in a simulated classroom towards a goal location (pink circle). At the start of its mission, it receives direction indications (arrows) from a human that indicate which path it should take to get to the goal. In this scenario, the human wants the robot to go around the desks on the right side of the classroom. A robot that does not reason over path preferences (green) will take the shortest path to the goal regardless of the human's input. Our method (blue) infers the human's path preference from these indications and adapts to their recommendations. we propose an approach that leverages probabilistic representations of human preference and incorporates real-time feedback. Previous research by Bajcsy et al. considered an online adaptation problem in a manipulation task, where the person can apply forces to the robot to indicate their preferences. By allowing the robot to continue its task while taking into account a probabilistic representation of human preference, their approach does not require frequent inputs. Building on this idea, we adopt a similar approach to adapt to a human's preference in the context of a robot autonomously navigating through a known environment, such as a cluttered office space. Specifically, we focus on allowing the human to influence the robot's trajectory with respect to obstacles, by providing guidance on preferred routes or paths, while the robot continues to execute its task. Paths can be represented using homotopy classes . However, homotopies can pose computational challenges when used to encode and infer human preferences. When the robot maintains a belief over homotopy classes, the inference problem can become exponentially complex with the number of obstacles in the space. Additionally, when the goal is unknown, the number of variables increases with the number of candidate destinations. This complexity can render the decision-making problem intractable."

      "These broadcasters were supported by producers such as Bruce Huff, Rob Pendleton, Alison Brown, Jean Bjorgen, David Elvin (who Vogel dubbed the \"Steven Spielberg of Talk Radio\"), Mitch Berg and others. The station has, for the most part, emphasized local hosts over the years. But in 1988, KSTP was one of Rush Limbaugh's first affiliates when his conservative talk show was rolled out for national syndication. (Clear Channel-owned KTLK-FM took over rights to Limbaugh's show in January 2006). Other syndicated hosts previously heard on KSTP include Sean Hannity, Bruce Williams, Larry King, and Owen Spann. Sports Radio\nKSTP switched to Sports Radio on February 15, 2010. As the station had to wait for ESPN's contract with rival KFAN and its sister station KFXN to expire, it did not become an ESPN Radio affiliate until April 12, the same day that the Minnesota Twins were scheduled to play the first game in their new ball park, Target Field, against the Boston Red Sox. As a result Coast to Coast AM and Live on Sunday Night, it's Bill Cunningham were retained during this period. One ESPN Radio network program, The Herd with Colin Cowherd, was picked up by KSTP immediately following the format change. In 2018, the station was approved for an FM translator on 94.1 FM, broadcasting from a transmitter atop the IDS Center in downtown Minneapolis. The two-watt signal threw most of its power to the west, preventing interference to low powered FM stations on the same channel including WFNU-LP in St. Paul. With only two watts of power, however, the signal was limited to the immediate downtown area surrounding the IDS Center. It later acquired a 250 watt translator, K235BP at 94.9 MHz. The original translator was discontinued. On January 15, 2019, KSTP rebranded as \"SKOR North\" (a reference to the Vikings team song/chant, \"Skol, Vikings\"), with local programming between 12 noon and 7 pm. About a year later, in May of 2020, KSTP suspended most of its local programming and laid off nearly all of its local staff."

While we see several CH$_3$OH lines as well as\nSO$_2$ and H$_2$CS toward some of the HMPOs and UCH{\\sc ii}s but not\ntoward the IRDCs, the surprising result of this comparison is the\npresence of the C$_2$H lines around 349.4\\,GHz toward all source types\nfrom young IRDCs via the HMPOs to evolved UCH{\\sc ii}s. Table\n\\ref{sample} lists the peak brightness temperatures, the integrated\nintensities and the FWHM line-widths of the C$_2$H line blend at\n349.399\\,GHz.

Wasn’t that the invitation you first heard when you first heard about Jesus? God has called us and we must decide. Jesus wants us all to follow him, to be like him, to walk in his footsteps, to do what he does. Of course this story is about that! And they do it, don’t they? Simon, Andrew, James, John, they do it! They decide and they do follow Jesus, imperfectly at that. Still, it’s a lot of pressure, a lot of responsibility. If life becomes all about what we do for Jesus, something is missing. If this is only a story about fishing, have some of us failed? Is it too late for us? Some of us might not be the best at fishing, not all the great about casting Jesus’ loving net to our brothers and sisters. His net is sometimes, or maybe more than sometimes, a bit more expansive than we might be comfortable with. He calls us to be like him and fish for people, and yet, sometimes we can barely get the net into the water. Perhaps for others, we aren’t even convinced that Jesus would include us in the net at all, no matter how deep into the water he goes. He can really mean me? Would his net really reach me? There’s still more to the story. This is a story about God, who God is, how God acts, what God does. Before Andrew, Simon, James and John follow Jesus, Jesus finds them. Before they follow Jesus, Jesus comes to them! They don’t have to go searching, they have been found. Jesus saw. Jesus spoke. Jesus called. Jesus said, “Come.“ We don’t follow Jesus in order to find him, to prove our worthiness with what we do, or even by showing Jesus how big our nets are. We follow Jesus because he first came to us. He came down to the beach to meet these four fishermen. He came specifically for Simon and for Andrew, for James and for John, for you and me."

      "Intel has a large benefit of having a relatively \"good name\" when it comes to CPUs, so they can effectively charge a brand-name premium. I'm sure there are other reasons, and probably better reasons, but these are the main ones that I think of. Mabsark wrote:Actually, that trend will not simply keep increasing going forward. The reason desktop/laptop sales are stagnating/decreasing is due to the fact that most people already have one and therefore don't need to buy another one. The exact same thing will happen with tablets as well. Sales are increasing now because people without tablets are buying them. When most people already own a tablet, they won't be buying a new one every year and therefore sales will stagnate/decrease. The PC market is saturated and in a couple of years, the tablet market will be saturated too. Basically, in order to increase sales in a saturated market, you need to increase the population growth or decrease the longevity of the product. That's true as long as most people are still buying both a tablet and a laptop when each needs to be replaced. I think the assumption is that, as you say, the tablet market will saturate, with people just replacing existing ones, but the desktop/laptop market could decrease much farther than that, if most people stop replacing them at all. I'm not sure of the likelihood of that, but I think that's where this idea comes from. ggeezz wrote:Intel cannot abandon the phone/tablet market. Desktop/laptop sales are stagnating/decreasing and phones/tablets are on the rise. This trend is only going to increase going forward. But you're right, they're going to have use their fabs that are a step or two behind the cutting the edge. But they're going to have to up their game in the tablet space to even be able to do that. The upcoming Haswell chip is showing to consume 1/3 the power of IvyBridge at peak, consumes 1/20th the power at idle, all the while maintaining Identical or better performance. This chip should actually compete with ARM CPUs on both power/performance and idle."

      "Scientists continue to study the causes. For instance, a new mutation for alpha-thalassemia was discovered for the first time among Iranian patients in 2004. BETA-THALASSEMIA. Most individuals have two normal copies of the beta globin gene, which is located on chromosome 11 and makes the beta globin component of normal adult hemoglobin, hemoglobin A. There are approximately 100 genetic mutations that have been described that cause beta thalassemia, designated as either beta0 or beta + mutations. No beta globin is produced with a beta0 mutation, and only a small fraction of the normal amount of beta globin is produced with a beta + mutation. When an individual has one normal beta globin gene and one with a beta thalassemia mutation, he or she is said to carry the beta thalassemia trait. Beta thalassemia trait, like other hemoglobin traits, is protective against malaria infection. Trait status is generally thought not to cause health problems, although some women with beta thalassemia trait may have an increased tendency toward anemia during pregnancy. When two members of a couple carry the beta thalassemia trait, there is a 25% chance that each of their children will inherit beta thalassemia disease by inheriting two beta thalassemia mutations, one from each parent. The clinical severity of the beta thalassemia disease—whether an individual has beta thalassemia intermedia or beta thalassemia major—will depend largely on whether the mutations inherited are beta0 thalassemia or beta + thalassemia mutations. Two beta0 mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia major, and two beta+ thalassemia mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia intermedia. Inheritance of one beta0 and one beta + thalassemia mutation tends to be less predictable. Although relatively uncommon, there are other thalassemia-like mutations that can affect the beta globin gene. Hemoglobin E is the result of a substitution of a single nucleotide. This change results in a structurally altered hemoglobin that is produced in decreased amounts."

      "(1) Physical modelling, (2) Algorithm design, (3) Numerical experiments and analysis of complex physical fields. The research of equation algorithm corresponds to the part (2) of the above three parts. The DBM aims at parts (1) and (3) of the three mentioned above. It belongs to a physical model construction method rather than a numerical solution for the equations. The tasks of DBM are to: (i) Ensure the rationality of the physical model (theoretical model) and balance the simplicity for the problem to be studied; (ii) Try to extract more valuable physical information from massive data and complex physical fields. Based on the coarse-grained modeling method of nonequilibrium statistical physics, the DBM aims to solve the following dilemma: (i) The traditional hydrodynamic modelings are based on the continuous hypothesis (or near-equilibrium hypothesis). They only concern the evolution of three conserved kinetic moments of the distribution function, i.e. the density, momentum and energy, so their physical functions are insufficient. (ii) The situation that the MD can be used is restricted to too small spatial-temporal scales. The physical requirement for the modeling is that except for the Hydrodynamic Non-Equilibriums (HNE), the most related TNE are also needed to be captured. Theoretically, the Boltzmann equation is suitable for all-regime flows, including the continuum regime, slip regime, transition regime, and free molecule flow regime. Based on the Chapman-Enskog (CE) multiscale analysis , through retaining various orders of Kn number (or considering different orders of TNE effects), the Boltzmann equation can be reduced to the various orders of hydrodynamic equations. They can be used to describe the hydrodynamic behaviors, i.e., the conservations of mass, momentum and energy , in corresponding flow regimes. Because what the traditional hydrodynamic equations describe are only the conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy. Consequently, it should be pointed out that, the information lost in the traditional hydrodynamic equations increases sharply with increasing the Kn number."

Libertarians accept that there are free actions, and in doing so, believe that we are morally responsible for some of our actions, namely, the free ones. The libertarian ONLY claims that we do have free will actions and affirm the incompatibility of determinism with free will. There is no claim here that free will is absolute, inviolable, and applies to every action and thus that people are \"self made at every instance. \"\nThus in the following it is clear you are burning an absurd strawman.

      "\"\nFurthermore, the absolute value constraint can be decomposed into linear constraints by the application of big-M method and the introduction of an auxiliary variable, as shown in the Appendix. Remark 3: The proposed formulation can accommodate arbitrary number of lanes at any given time instant k. This means that if at any given time, the number of available lanes for traveling either increases or decreases, the proposed formulation will still continue to hold. This is an important consideration since many a times on highways, some lanes are blocked due to various unanticipated situations such as road accidents, roadwork, narrowing of road etc. 2) Computational Complexity Reduction: This section details the optimization problem reformulation with binary variables, optimization warm start technique and lazy constraint implementation, all of which combine to improve the computational complexity of our SLAS module. Binary Variables: The proposed formulation in Section III-B has relatively high computation complexity (computation time of ∼ 2s in the worst case scenario -slow moving traffic blocking all the lanes) due to the integer decision variables yielding a mixed-integer optimization problem . To circumvent the computational overload, we reformulate the problem with binary variables that replace the integer variables, as follows:\nwhere the Lk (i, j) represents the modified target lane variable, indexed by the lane (i) as well as the planning step (j) and Lk (a, b) = 1 represents the choice of lane a ∈ L as the target lane at planning step b ∈ Z . Then, some of the constraints from the SLAS formulation in Section III-B are modified as follows:\nHere, initializes the target lane, (21) restricts the target lane at any planning step to the set of available lanes, restricts the lane change between consecutive planning steps to the adjacent lanes, and ( ) represents the augmented safety constraint. The implication ( =⇒ ) in ( ) can easily be transformed into a linear constraint (see Appendix)."

Themes and motifs\nWeep Not, Child integrates Gikuyu mythology and the ideology of nationalism that serves as catalyst for much of the novel's action. The novel explores the negative aspects of colonial rule over Kenya. Njoroge's aspiration to attend university is frustrated by both the violence of the Mau Mau rebels and the violent response of the colonial government. This disappointment leads to his alienation from his family and ultimately his suicide attempt. The novel also ponders the role of saviours and salvation. The author notes in his The River Between: \"Salvation shall come from the hills. From the blood that flows in me, I say from the same tree, a son shall rise. And his duty shall be to lead and save the people.\" Jomo Kenyatta, the first prime minister of Kenya, is immortalised in Weep Not, Child. The author says, \"Jomo had been his (Ngotho's) hope. Ngotho had come to think that it was Jomo who would drive away the white man. To him, Jomo stood for custom and traditions purified by grace of learning and much travel.\" Njoroge comes to view Jomo as a messiah who will win the struggle against the colonial government."

We have this enormous, artificial scarcity today over the means of communication, because the government awards licenses which self-perpetuate.

So if you've got a license today, you get a second one; if you don't have one, you get nothing. That is going to be our policy about HDTV. I think it would be a lot better if we had more markets, more choices, and better values. I don't know how to do better values, but we know how to do more choices. So the point is, we'll wind up with some new regime which I don't think that we can particularly predict. I don't think that it is going to be chaotic or anarchic. I think there is something about people as social animals or creatures -- we will create some new forms of social organization. There will be information middlemen; there will be the equivalent of editors and packagers. There will be trusted intermediaries who help organize these new media. If you open it up and equalize things so that everybody can participate, you will get more diversity of points of view, you will get less homogenization. One of the reasons that tons of people have just dropped out, or are in terminal couch-potato-dom is that the sets of choices and the values that come across the tube are not ones that stir the human heart. And people know that. They can't figure out what to do about that, so they sort of fuzz out on drugs and alcohol. I say let's edit TV, which is the electronic drug. Let's do something about that.

      "In the Supplementary Material we show the spectra for a p = 0.036 denoiser, where we observe a clustering of eigenvalues reminiscent of Refs. . There we also investigate the channel entropy of the various supercircuits . Conclusion. -We have introduced a probabilistic error cancellation scheme, where a classically determined denoiser mitigates the accumulated noise of a (generally non-Clifford) local noise channel. The required number of mitigation gates, i.e. the dimensionality of the corresponding quasiprobability distribution, is tunable and the parameterization of the corresponding channels provides control over the sign problem that is inherent to probabilistic error cancellation. We have shown that a denoiser with one layer can already significantly mitigate errors for second-order Trotter circuits with up to 64 layers. This effectiveness of low-depth compressed circuits for denoising, in contrast with the noiseless time evolution operator compression from , can be understood from the non-unitarity of the denoiser channels. In particu-lar, measurements can have non-local effects, since the measurement of a single qubit can reduce some highly entangled state (e.g. a GHZ state) to a product state, whereas in unitary circuits the spreading of correlations forms a light-cone. To optimize a denoiser with convenience at L > 8, the optimization can be formulated in terms of matrix product operators or channels , which is convenient because the circuit calculations leading to the normalized distance and its gradient are easily formulated in terms of tensor contractions and singular value decompositions . This provides one route to a practical denoiser, which is relevant because the targeted noiseless circuit and the accompanying noisy variant in (4) need to be simulated classically, confining the optimization procedure to limited system sizes with an exact treatment or limited entanglement with tensor networks. Nonetheless, we can use e.g. matrix product operators to calculate (4) for some relatively small t, such that the noiseless and denoised supercircuits in (4) have relatively small entanglement, and then stack the final denoised supercircuit on a quantum processor to generate classically intractable states."

All else being equal a 14nm chip should be significantly faster and more efficient than the same chip at 22nm. Add in the fact that yields increase geometrically - you can fit a lot more 14nm chips on a given wafer size vs 22nm (or 32nm for the other manufacturers.) and you have a very appealing proposition. And then add in the fact that Intel actually has a pretty good graphics stack and IP. My point was that Intel might have a one or two process advantage over the rest of the industry at the cutting edge but that doesn't mean that they can afford to manufacture on those processes for very low margin parts. If the SoC market becomes increasingly commoditised, there isn't going to be the money to justify making them in a state of the art fab.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "English had been a supporter of Bolger as leader, but Shipley reappointed him Minister of Health in her new cabinet. English was promoted to Minister of Finance in a reshuffle in January 1999, a position which was at the time subordinate to the Treasurer, Bill Birch. After a few months, the pair switched positions as part of Birch's transition to retirement, with English assuming the senior portfolio. In early interviews, he emphasised his wish to be seen as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue, and said that the initiatives of some of his predecessors (Roger Douglas's \"Rogernomics\" and Ruth Richardson's \"Ruthanasia\") had focused on \"fruitless, theoretical debates\" when \"people just want to see problems solved\". Opposition (1999–2008)\n\nAfter the National Party lost the 1999 election to Helen Clark's Labour Party, English continued on in the shadow cabinet as National's spokesperson for finance. He was elected deputy leader of the party in February 2001, following the resignation of Wyatt Creech, with Gerry Brownlee being his unsuccessful opponent. Leader of the Opposition\nIn October 2001, after months of speculation, Jenny Shipley resigned as leader of the National Party after being told she no longer had the support of the party caucus. English was elected as her replacement unopposed (with Roger Sowry as his deputy), and consequently became Leader of the Opposition. However, he did not openly organise against Shipley, and according to The Southland Times \"there was almost an element of 'aw, shucks, I'll do it then' about Mr English's ascension\". Aged 39 when he was elected, English became the second-youngest leader in the National Party's history, after Jim McLay (who was 38 when elected in 1984). He also became only the third Southlander to lead a major New Zealand political party, after Joseph Ward and Adam Hamilton. However, English failed to improve the party's performance. In the 2002 election, National suffered its worst electoral defeat ever, gaining barely more than twenty percent of the vote."

      "For those with the hemoglobin H/Constant Spring form of the disease, the need for transfusions may be intermittent or ongoing, perhaps on a monthly basis and requiring desferoxamine treatment. Individuals with this more severe form of the disease may also have an increased chance of requiring removal of an enlarged and/or overactive spleen. Anemia — A blood condition in which the level of hemoglobin or the number of red blood cells falls below normal values. Common symptoms include paleness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Bilirubin — A yellow pigment that is the end result of hemoglobin breakdown. This pigment is metabolized in the liver and excreted from the body through the bile. Bloodstream levels are normally low; however, extensive red cell destruction leads to excessive bilirubin formation and jaundice. Bone marrow — A spongy tissue located in the hollow centers of certain bones, such as the skull and hip bones. Bone marrow is the site of blood cell generation. Bone marrow transplantation — A medical procedure used to treat some diseases that arise from defective blood cell formation in the bone marrow. Healthy bone marrow is extracted from a donor to replace the marrow in an ailing individual. Proteins on the surface of bone marrow cells must be identical or very closely matched between a donor and the recipient. Desferoxamine — The primary drug used in iron chelation therapy. It aids in counteracting the life-threatening buildup of iron in the body associated with long-term blood transfusions. Globin — One of the component protein molecules found in hemoglobin. Normal adult hemoglobin has a pair each of alpha-globin and beta-globin molecules. Heme — The iron-containing molecule in hemoglobin that serves as the site for oxygen binding. Hemoglobin — Protein-iron compound in the blood that carries oxygen to the cells and carries carbon dioxide away from the cells. Hemoglobin A — Normal adult hemoglobin that contains a heme molecule, two alpha-globin molecules, and two beta-globin molecules."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "The results are shown in Fig. , which contains histograms for the channel count N G versus α. The histograms are stacked, with the lightest color corresponding to the angles of the denoiser at t = 0.5 and the darkest at t = 5. The top four panels are for a denoiser with M = 2 and the bottom four with M = 8. We consider M trot = 8, 16, 32, 64. We see that in both cases the distribution widens upon increasing M trot , indicating that the unitary channels start deviating more from the identity. Moreover, while the M = 2 denoisers in all cases except M trot = 64 have ZZ contributions close to the identity, this is clearly not the case for M = 8. For simplicity, we did not focus on obtaining denoisers with the smallest sampling overhead γ, which is required to minimize the sign problem and hence ease the sampling of mitigated quantities. Instead, we let the optimization freely choose the η i in the denoiser parameterization, as defined in the main text. In Fig. we show the sampling overhead of the denoisers from Fig. of the main text. We see that for M = 1 and M = 2 the sampling overhead is relatively small and uniform across the different t, whereas for M > 2 the optimization sometimes yields a denoiser with large γ and other times with small γ. This could be related to the difference in α distributions from Fig. . The large fluctuations of γ appears to stem from the difficulty in finding optimal deep denoisers, and our optimization procedure likely only finds a local minimum in these cases. Here C(t) is the Trotter supercircuit for time t. In Fig. we show Z dw for the circuits from Fig."

We’ve toned down the frequency this ability triggers, as well as reduced the duration it’s active for when it does trigger. We feel Juggernaut is still a powerful Champion despite these revisions. Take care! Slightly reduced the starting values of Wolverine's “Cellular Regeneration”. • We found that Cellular Regeneration was too strong at lower levels where fewer counters to Regeneration exist. Re-scaled Gamora's “Assassination” to start higher but scale slower. • At lower levels, Special Attacks were used too infrequently, giving this powerful ability little visibility. We’ve adjusted the scaling to better match Special Attack usage at all levels. Increased the frequency that Black Bolt’s “Provocation” triggers. • Due to the varying Critical Hit rates across all Champions, in some cases Provocation would trigger rarely or not at all within a fight. We’ve increased the frequency to ensure you’ll see it every match – but especially so against opponents with high Critical Hit rates. We’ll continue to follow the effect of these new abilities on gameplay. Please keep your feedback coming! Hey everyone! We have been hard at work on improving the game and have prepared a big update inspired in part by your great community feedback. Please keep letting us know what you think! • Fixed many Dash, Medium, Heavy and Special Attacks missing or failing to execute. • Added Alliances and a new Alliance Crystal. • Rocket Raccoon and Unstoppable Colossus join The Contest. • Temporary Boosts to Attack, Health, and XP are now available from the Alliance Crystal. • Rewards for completing and exploring Chapters and Acts.

And I have said that publicly and I will say that privately. So my judgment is just based upon my experience with him, the fact that he is a knowledgeable person, he understands the need to interact and interface with the West. I think he could be a viable candidate. But ultimately, my opinion is hopefully going to be the opinion of the Libyan people. BLITZER: Because you probably have seen all of the articles, the reports over the past month, month and a half, of mass murder, of killings, not only by Saif Al-Islam, but some of his brothers that have gone on, the atrocities that have been so widely reported. I hear what you're saying about his role over the recent years when the Bush administration, and later the Obama administration, was trying to improve relations with Libya, but over the past several weeks, based on all of the international reporting we have seen, it's been a brutal record that he has accomplished. WELDON: Well, again, I don't have firsthand evidence of that. I just got here two days ago. And I fully support an international tribunal to look at human rights violations on everyone in this country. That's necessary. And if they find evidence that he has been involved in that, then he should suffer the consequences of his actions. (END VIDEOTAPE) BLITZER: In our next hour, part two of the interview with former congressman Curt Weldon. There have been some questions raised about his motive. Is he in all of this for the money? You're going to find out his answer to that and more. Stand by. Also, Washington, D.C.'s congressional delegate is telling colleagues -- and I'm quoting her now -- \"Go to hell.\""

      "They are all helpful to characterize the TNE strength and describe the TNE behaviors of a fluid system from their perspectives. But it is not enough only relying on these quantities. Besides the above physical quantities describing the TNE behaviors, in DBM modeling, we can also use the non-conservative moments of ( f − f eq ) to characterize the TNE state and extract TNE information from the fluid system. Fundamentally, four TNE quantities can be defined in a firstorder DBM, i.e., ∆ σ * 2 , ∆ σ * 3,1 , ∆ σ * 3 , and ∆ σ * 4,2 . Their definitions can be seen in Table , where v * i = v i − u represents the central velocity and u is the macro flow velocity of the mixture. Physically, ∆ σ * 2 = ∆ σ * 2,αβ e α e β and ∆ σ * 3,1 = ∆ σ * 3,1 e α represent the viscous stress tensor (or non-organized momentum flux, NOMF) and heat flux tensor (or non-organized energy flux, NOEF), respectively. The e α (e β ) is the unit vector in the α (β ) direction. The later two higher-order TNE quantities contain more condensed information. Specifically, and it indicates the flux information of ∆ σ * 2 . To describe the TNE strength of the whole fluid system, some TNE quantities contained more condensed information are also defined, i.e.,\nOther TNE quantities can be defined based on specific requirements. All the independent components of TNE characteristic quantities open a highdimensional phase space, and this space and its subspaces provide an intuitive image for characterizing the TNE state and understanding TNE behaviors . It should be emphasized that: (i) The TNE strength/intensity/degree is the most basic parameter of non-equilibrium flow description; And any definition of non-equilibrium strength/intensity/degree depends on the research perspective. (ii) The physical meaning of D * m,n is the TNE strength of this perspective. (iii) From a certain perspective, the TNE strength is increasing; While from a different perspective, the TNE strength, on the other hand, may be decreasing.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "All gates are affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p = 0.01. The non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0, and the noiseless values with p = 0. where sgn(η g ) is the sign of the sampled coefficient of the gth channel. γ = 1 means that all signs are positive. Observables Ô p=0 for the noiseless circuit are then approximated by resampling the observables from the denoiser ensemble\nwhere γ = N G g=1 γ g is the overall sampling overhead, with γ g the overhead of the gth gate. Clearly, a large γ implies a large variance of Ô p=0 for a given number of samples, with accurate estimation requiring the cancellation of large signed terms. The number of samples required to resolve this cancellation of signs is bounded by Hoeffding's inequality, which states that a sufficient number of samples to estimate Ô p=0 with error δ at probability 1 − ω is bounded by (2γ 2 /δ 2 ) ln(2/ω) . Since γ scales exponentially in γ g , it is clear that a denoiser with large M and γ 1 will require many samples. We observed that decompositions with γ > 1 are crucial for an accurate denoiser. Restricting to γ = 1 leads to large infidelity and no improvement upon increasing the number of terms in or the depth M of the denoiser. Simply put, probabilistic error cancellation of gate noise introduces a sign problem and it is crucial to find optimal parameterizations (1) which minimize γ to make the approach scalable. This issue arises in all high performance error mitigation schemes , because the inverse of a physical noise channel is unphysical and cannot be represented as a positive sum over CPTP maps. This is clearly visible in the spectra of the denoiser, which lies outside the unit circle (cf. Fig. ). This makes the tunability of the number of gates in each denoiser sample a crucial ingredient, which allows control over the sign problem, because we can freely choose the η i in . For the parametrization (1) of denoiser channels, we try to find a set of parameters for error mitigation by minimizing the normalized Frobenius distance between the noiseless and denoised supercircuits\nwhich bounds the distance of output density matrices and becomes zero for perfect denoising."

      "Probably one of the most frustrating things about building experimental aircraft, especially when starting with a minimum of pre-fabricated parts, is to start building and ending up with an unexpected result. Every builder starts a new project by wanting it to go \"perfectly.\" So when things aren't going well, especially at the beginning, the frustration can lead to an unfinished airplane. This is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage -- the first part of the construction process. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 & KR-2 series planes. While building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder's fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built. First understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the \"projected\" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are \"foreshortened\" and don't give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron. What needs to be done is to \"develop\" the \"true\" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat."

Since he shared that with me in a message he’s stonewalled and has retreated to the safety of minimal messages and talks about not knowing what best to say and not being able to find the right words somehow. He’s a good kind man who I feel is struggling. I’m concerned about his anxiety and possibly the risk of depression. I’m fairly resilient and whilst i’m disappointed he doesn’t want to pursue a relationship with me, i’m concerned for him and his well being. One of his very few close friends is also just leaving the country to live overseas. The strategy I’ve used so far is simply to back off and give him space. I’ve asked to take him up on an original offer he made to talk but haven’t pushed it. I also haven’t been aggressive or accusatory in the few messages i’ve sent.

It was fun. Swarm had me scared at first, but it turned into kind of a bullying match between us and legion. Last hour became p obvious which way it was gonna go. Legion rly stepped up their game in the end there, respect. We are investigating this. Here is what we know: Several of the accounts used the same password. Most of the accounts belonged to people who knew each other personally. The accounts were all switched from the same IP Addresses. The person who logged in, got into each account on the first attempt, so they knew the password for each account. What you should know: QONQR never stores passwords, not even in the logs. Passwords are hashed (one way encrypted) and can never be decrypted When you authenticate to our servers, we hash the password you gave us and compare it to the encrypted password in the database to see if they match. Access to our database in the could is restricted tightly and we are confident no one breached the system. What you should do: Don't use the same password as other people you play with. Don't share your password with anyone. I heard all the French players fled to the UK after one German player accidentally shot a single missile into France. Most factions now use GroupMe or Line as their means of communication, the forums are too slow as a means of communication and insecure for specific faction conversations. Think of the forums are more of a gaming information resource rather than a means of communication.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "The risk for specific individuals depends on current health status, age, and other factors. Because of the risks involved and the fact that beta thalassemia is a treatable condition, transplant physicians require a brother or sister donor who has an identically matched tissue type, called HLA type. HLA type refers to the unique set of proteins present on each individual's cells, which allows the immune system to recognize \"self\" from \"foreign.\" HLA type is genetically determined, so there is a 25% chance for two siblings to be a match. Transplant physicians and researchers are also investigating ways to improve the safety and effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation. Using newborn sibling umbilical cord blood—the blood from the placenta that is otherwise discarded after birth but contains cells that can go on to make bone marrow—seems to provide a safer and perhaps more effective source of donor cells. Donors and recipients may not have to be perfect HLA matches for a successful transplant using cord blood cells. Trials are also underway to determine the effectiveness of \"partial transplants,\" in which a safer transplant procedure is used to replace only a percentage of the affected individual's bone marrow. Other possible treatments on the horizon may include gene therapy techniques aimed at increasing the amount of normal hemoglobin the body is able to make. Hemoglobin H disease is a relatively mild form of thalassemia that may go unrecognized. It is not generally considered a condition that will reduce one's life expectancy. Education is an important part of managing the health of an individual with hemoglobin H disease. It is important to be able to recognize the signs of severe anemia that require medical attention. It is also important to be aware of the medications, chemicals, and other exposures to avoid due to the theoretical risk they pose of causing a severe anemia event. When severe anemia occurs, it is treated with blood transfusion therapy. For individuals with hemoglobin H disease, this is rarely required."

I do think a program like BC is probably more patient with players than some of the bigger programs. We won't rush a guy out of the program to free up a scholarship. We prefer to redshirt. And I think the nature of a program -- with good academic support and less of a big school mentality -- keeps kids from falling through the cracks. Every recruit thinks they are going to be a star, so selling them on development and a safety net doesn't sway many, but it should. If anything BC should use a guy like Marcus Grant -- a local kid who left a Big Ten program to come \"home\" as an example to Massachusetts recruits. Massachusetts kids keep leaving to play at the \"highest level.\" Our counter should be that we will develop them for life and the NFL (the real highest level) and not chew them up and spit them out like a football factory. I am sure that there will be a guy in the near future who decommits from BC and becomes a star. Or a guy we should have had who leads another team to glory. Right now I am just glad that we have very few regrets when it comes to old recruits. Our recruiting still has major challenges, but that's one area where things have broken our way.

Reduced number and aberrant architecture of dendritic spines are common features of DS neuropathology. However, the mechanisms involved in DS spine alterations are not known. In addition to a relevant role in synapse formation and maintenance, astrocytes can regulate spine dynamics by releasing soluble factors or by physical contact with neurons. We have previously shown impaired mitochondrial function in DS astrocytes leading to metabolic alterations in protein processing and secretion. In this study, we investigated whether deficits in astrocyte function contribute to DS spine pathology. Analysis of Dendritic Spine Morphology in Cultured CNS Neurons Authors: Deepak P. Srivastava, Kevin M. Woolfrey, Peter Penzes. Published: 07-13-2011 JoVE Neuroscience\nDendritic spines are the sites of the majority of excitatory connections within the brain, and form the post-synaptic compartment of synapses. These structures are rich in actin and have been shown to be highly dynamic. In response to classical Hebbian plasticity as well as neuromodulatory signals, dendritic spines can change shape and number, which is thought to be critical for the refinement of neural circuits and the processing and storage of information within the brain. Within dendritic spines, a complex network of proteins link extracellular signals with the actin cyctoskeleton allowing for control of dendritic spine morphology and number. Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that a number of disease states, ranging from schizophrenia to autism spectrum disorders, display abnormal dendritic spine morphology or numbers. Moreover, recent genetic studies have identified mutations in numerous genes that encode synaptic proteins, leading to suggestions that these proteins may contribute to aberrant spine plasticity that, in part, underlie the pathophysiology of these disorders."

Garner et al., The Law of Judicial Precedent 364–65 (2016); Randy J. Kozel, Settled Versus Right: A Theory of Precedent 112–13 (2017). It should be noted that the authors of The Law of Judicial Precedent classify the physical presence rule as a constitutional precedent for stare decisis purposes, thus anticipating the Court’s misstep in Wayfair.

Wayfair’s stare decisis analysis resorts to the formalism of making constitutional a “magic” word65× 65.

      "They are key factors in compression science field. The former is induced by temperature gradient and the NOEF (∆ * 3,1 ). The latter is affected by velocity gradient and the NOMF (∆ * 2 ). The entropy production rates are defined by the following formulas : Integrating the ṠNOEF and ṠNOMF over time t, the entropy generations over this period of time are obtained, i.e., S NOEF = t 0 ṠNOEF dt and S NOMF = t 0 ṠNOMF dt. Plotted in Fig. ) and 14(b) are the temporal evolution of ṠNOMF and ṠNOEF , respectively. The evolution of entropy generation rate is related to two aspects: (i) the propagation of the shock wave, and (ii) the deformation of the bubble. The former generates a macroscopic quantity gradient, and the latter makes the contact interface wider, longer, and deformed. Depending on the location of the shock wavefront, there exist two critical moments in this SBI process: (i) at around t = 0.03, the shock wave just sweeps through the bubble, and (ii) at t = 0.06, the shock wave exits the flow field. Therefore, the temporal evolution of the entropy production rate shows three stages, i.e., t < 0.03, 0.03 < t < 0.06, and t > 0.06. At the stage t < 0.03, the shock compression stage, the shock effects compress the bubble. It generates the large macroscopic quantity gradients, resulting in a quick increase of ṠNOMF . At around t = 0.03, the shock wave passed through the bubble. So the values of ṠNOMF decreases. The values of ṠNOMF would continue to decrease due to the gradually wider contact interface caused by the diffusion effect. At around t = 0.06, the shock wave comes out of the flow field so that the values of ṠNOMF drops rapidly. In the third stage, i.e., t > 0.06, because of the diffusive effect, the general trend of ṠNOMF is downward. However, it shows an oscillatory trend due to the influence of various reflected shock waves. The specific heat ratio indirectly changes the value of ṠNOMF by changing the velocity gradient. The smaller the specific-heat ratio, the larger ṠNOMF . Different understanding can be seen in Fig. , where the temporal evolution of ṠNOEF is plotted."

      "Bhattacharya propose an efficient algorithm for solving pathplanning problems under homotopic constraints. However, the number of homotopy classes for a given problem can be infinite, and as the robot changes location and updates its representation of the world, carrying out inference over homotopy classes in a dynamic environment requires recomputing the set of homotopies at every iteration, making the belief update challenging. Prior work has addressed the challenge of shared autonomy by considering how robots can infer a human's intended goal, or how they can infer the preferred path to a goal. However, we argue that inferring the goal and the path as separate problems can lead to over-confidence in incorrect beliefs about the user's preferences. To illustrate this point, consider the following scenario: a robot and a human are collaborating to move an object from one end of a room to Fig. : Using the hyperplanes composing the H-representation of each obstacle, we construct a hyperplane arrangement of the obstacle-free space (a). We define the human's preference for the robot's one step action choices as the posterior distribution (given all human input up to that point) over transitions from the current to the neighboring polytopes, i.e. edges on the graph. Each time the robot transitions to a new polytope, the set of neighbor polytopes and the distribution over human preferences are updated. another, but there is an obstacle in the way. The human would like the robot to take a path around the obstacle on the left, even though the goal is on the right. If the robot only infers the goal from the human's inputs, it may incorrectly assume that the goal is on the right, and become over-confident in this belief. On the other hand, if the robot only infers the preferred path, it may mistakenly assume that the goal is on the left, leading to a failure in completing the task. To overcome these challenges, our work proposes a joint inference approach that considers both the human's intended goal and their preferred path to that goal."

      "(It should be noted, in relation to such models, that even if this is how our choices are made, our choice to choose one of these “alternative possibilities” will still be caused by prior causes that are ultimately completely beyond our own control. Nothing changes this fact, again because decision-making is the product of complex physical processes; it is not an uncaused event.) It is generally unclear what the purpose of such models is. Are they a hypotheses we should test? They do not seem to be. Generally, these models most of all seem like an attempt to make the world fit our preconceived intuitions, which most of all resembles pseudoscience. Fortunately, there is plenty of relief available to the libertarians and other people who have this fear, and it does not involve any unscientific models – neither two-stage, three-stage, nor any other number of stages. The source of this relief is the simple earlier-mentioned fact that we can never know whether there is just one or infinitely many possible outcomes from the present state of the universe. This simple fact gives us all the relief we could ask for, because it reveals that there is no reason to be sure that there is just one possible outcome from the present state of the universe. And, to repeat an important point, we are then left with the conclusion that the only reasonable thing to do is to try to make the best impact we can in the world, which is true no matter whether there is just one possible outcome from the present state of the universe or not, since our actions still have consequences and therefore still matter even in a fully deterministic universe. Some, especially libertarians, might want to object to the claim that we can never know whether determinism is true or not, and even claim that we in fact now know, or at least have good reasons to believe, that indeterminism is true. Here is neuroscientist Peter Tse expressing something along those lines: “Henceforth, I will accept the weight of evidence from modern physics, and assume ontological indeterminism to be the case.”"

Although we have no\ninformation in the 12 days prior to Sep.~30, 2005, a simple linear\nextrapolation of the early October lightcurve back prior to Sep.~30,\n2005 suggests that the actual peak $m_{V}$ was somewhere between 9 and\n12. The corresponding distance estimates are then between 29 and\n115\\,kpc (with a mid-point $m_{V}$=10.5 value yielding a distance\nestimate of 58\\,kpc). Many methods have been used to estimate the\ndistance to the LMC (e.g.  Kovacs 2000, Nelson et al.\\ 2000), but a\nvalue of around 50\\,kpc appears to be quite robust. Our distance\nestimate is certainly consistent with that of the LMC, though the\nerrors are quite large. It does appear to be the case however, that\nour distance estimate places the source far outside of our own Galaxy. This, together with the source's position on the sky (at the eastern\nedge of the LMC) and the sizable ($\\sim$Galactic) X-ray hydrogen\ncolumn densities obtained from the spectral fits, suggest strongly\nthat XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 lies within the LMC itself."

      "The most significant factors influencing the likelihood of catching regulated species were month (January was significantly lower: p<0.001), number of hooks (p<0.001) and engine power (<0.01). Significant factors associated with standardised CPUE of regulated species were number of hooks (p<0.001), fishing gear (<0.001), number of sets (p<0.001), engine power (p<0.01) and month (November and January: p<0.05) (Table 5 and Fig 4). Plots of most significant factors affecting standardised CPUE (number of individuals per 100 hooks per set) of regulated species: a) hook number, b) gear type, c) number of sets. Although Tanjung Luar’s targeted shark fishery is small in scale, considerable numbers of shark are landed, including a large proportion of threatened and regulated species. A key finding is that measures of CPUE, for all sharks and for threatened and regulated species, vary spatially and temporally, and with several aspects of fishing effort including gear type, hook number, engine power and number of sets. Moreover, the relationships between CPUE and fishing behaviour variables are different for different measures of CPUE (CPUE per trip, CPUE per set, CPUE per 100 hooks per set). This highlights the importance of using appropriate standardisation for meaningful comparisons of CPUE across different gears and vessel types, and has important implications for fisheries management. Unstandardised CPUE (individuals per set) was significantly lower in January. This is during the west monsoon season, which is characterised by high rainfall and adverse conditions at sea for fishing. Unstandardised CPUE was also significantly lower in West Nusa Tenggara Province (WNTP) than East Nusa Tenggara Province (ENTP) and other provinces, suggesting a lower abundance of sharks in this area. Engine power had a significant positive influence on unstandardised CPUE, and was also associated with longer trips and more sets, which was likely due to the ability of vessels with larger engines to travel longer distances, over longer time periods, and with higher numbers of sets, to favoured fishing grounds."

Then, the effects of specific-heat ratio on the dynamic process and TNE behaviors on SBI are investigated. Comparison with experimental results\n\nIn the following part, we use a first-order two-fluid DBM to simulate the interaction between a planar shock wave with a 2-D heavy-cylindrical bubbles, and compare the DBM results with the experimental results from Ref. . The computational configuration can be seen in Fig. . In a flow field which is filled with Air, there is a static bubble composed of 26% Air and 74% SF 6 . A shock with Ma = 1.2 would pass through the bubble from left to right. The initial conditions of ambient gas are ρ 0 = 1.29kg/m 3 , T 0 = 293K, p 0 = 101.3kPa. Ignoring the pressure difference between interior gas and ambient gas, the initial parameters of the bubble are ρ bubble = 4.859kg/m 3 , p bubble = 101.3kPa,\nand T 0 = 293K. For simulating, these actual physical quantities should be transferred to dimensionless parameters. This process can refer to the Appendix A. The dimensionless conditions of macroscopic quantities of the fluid field in initial time are (ρ, T, u x , u y ) bubble = (4.0347, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0), (ρ, T, u x , u y ) 1 = (1.3416,\n1.128, 0.3616, 0.0), (ρ, T, u x , u y ) 0 = (1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0), where the subscript \"0\" (\"1\") represents downstream (upstream) region. In two-fluid DBM code, the distribution function f Air is used to describe the ambient gas, i.e., Air. The f bubble characters the bubble which is a mixture that composed of Air and SF 6 . The grid number is N x × N y = 800 × 400, where the N x and N y are grid number in x and y direction, respectively. This grid size has passed the mesh convergence test."

In 2005, he voted for the Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill, which would have amended the Marriage Act to define marriage as only between a man and a woman. English voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill that legalised same-sex marriage in New Zealand. However, in December 2016 he stated, \"I'd probably vote differently now on the gay marriage issue. I don't think that gay marriage is a threat to anyone else's marriage\". In 2009, English voted against the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill, a bill aimed at amending the Misuse of Drugs Act so that cannabis could be used for medical purposes."

      "A) To comply with the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement and avoid interference with another station.",
      "B) To increase its daytime power to 25 KW, as authorized by the FRC.",
      "C) To become an affiliate for the NBC Red Network, which required a specific frequency.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "documentation": [
      "Beginning on November 24, 1927 the WAMD broadcasts, still on 1330 kHz, were shifted to KFOY's facility in St. Paul. (At this time KFOY was assigned to 1050 kHz). The next day it was announced that National Battery had purchased KFOY, and as of December 1, 1927 both KFOY and WAMD were reassigned to 1350 kHz. WAMD continued making regular broadcasts until the end of March 1928, while KFOY, although it continued to be licensed for a few more months on a time-sharing basis with WAMD, ceased operations at this point. National Battery Company\nIn mid-December 1927, the National Battery Company announced it had received permission from the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) to build a new station, with the call letters KSTP, operating from a transmitter site to be constructed three miles south of Wescott. The next month it was reported that the new station, still under construction, had been assigned to 1360 kHz. KSTP made its debut broadcast on March 29, 1928. Although technically it was a separate station from WAMD and KFOY, both of which were formally deleted on April 30, 1928, overall KSTP was treated as the direct successor to a consolidated WAMD and KFOY. Hubbard became the merged station's general manager, acquiring controlling interest in 1941. A month after the merger, KSTP became an affiliate for the NBC Red Network. It remained with NBC for 46 years. On November 11, 1928, under the provisions of the FRC's General Order 40, KSTP was assigned to a \"high-powered regional\" frequency of 1460 kHz. The only other station assigned to this frequency was WTFF in Mount Vernon Hills, Virginia (later WJSV, now WFED, Washington, D.C.). On February 7, 1933, the FRC authorized KSTP to increase its daytime power to 25 KW. In 1938 and 1939 KSTP also operated a high-fidelity AM \"experimental audio broadcasting station\" Apex station, W9XUP, originally on 25,950 kHz and later on 26,150 kHz. In 1941, as part of the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, KSTP was assigned to its current \"clear channel\" frequency of 1500 kHz, with the provision that it and WJSV, as \"Class I-B\" stations, had to maintain directional antennas at night in order to mutually protect each other from interference."

    "documentation": [
      "Remember the forward bulkhead needs to be shaped in a way that will closely match the aft end of your canopy frame. Make an aft bulkhead by placing a straight edge at the top of your forward bulkhead and the trailing edge of your horizontal stabilizer. This will give you an idea of how tall your aft bulkhead needs to be. As far as location, I placed my aft bulkhead just forward of the lower/front of my vertical fin. I constructed the jig on the fuselage, it is glued together with automotive bondo. After the bulkheads were bondoed to the fuselage I used the stringers that I ripped from the 1x4s and bondoed them to the bulkheads. This gave me a male form to cover with thin plastic or posterboard. I stapled two layers of posterboard to the jig(thin plastic would work better). The posterboard wraps down two inches onto the fuselage. After I was satisfied with the way it looked, I then covered the entire thing with duct tape (fiberglass will not stick to duct tape) On top of this I wetout one layer of tri-ply cloth (22oz) that I had left over from an earlier project, and one layer of 8oz. bid. Remember to mask off your fuselage so you don't get epoxy on it. If you are not familiar with composite lay-ups, you should plan on razor cutting your lay-ups 4 to 6 hours after wetout while the lay-up is still soft enough to cut with a razorblade. After the lay-up cured (2 or 3 days) it was removed from the jig, and the jig was removed from the fuselage and discarded. (be careful, the bondo sticks very well to the spruce, you could splinter your wood during removal) I now have a fiberglass skin that tends to hold the shape of the jig but is still flexible enough to work with. I made two bulkheads out of 1/4 last-a-foam (AS&S) using the plywood formers from the jig as a guide. I covered these foam bulkheads with one 8oz layer of glass on each side, with a glass to glass edge on the bottom. After cure these bulkheads were bondoed into place (to the fuselage)and the fiberglass skin was pulled down tight and floxed to the bulkheads."

The pamphlet airily dismisses concerns that vaccines have side effects or that you could possibly have too many. It is pure public relations, and if the RSPH claims to be \"independent\" it also admits that the publication was paid for by Merck, a detail which was reported by British Medical Journal and the Guardian, but not true to form by the BBC. We have, in truth, been building to this moment for two decades: as the evidence piles up that every single aspect of the program lacks integrity or is simply rotten to the core all the perpetrators can do is call for the silencing of their critics, and maintain the products are safe because they say so. Please help give the ICAN letter the widest possible distribution, particularly to politicians. \"The outcome of disease always depends both on the virulence of the pathogen and the health of the individual immune system.\"\nNope. This makes no sense. Lots of people who seemed vibrant will get a very severe case of the same illness that a vulnerable baby overcomes in a day. And under the germ theory it doesn't matter how strong your immune system *was*. Once it's been overcome by the pathogen it is every bit as weak as anybody else's with that pathogen. What you say makes no sense. There's no reason for me to reply to you again. \"Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared?\"\nWhy do you keep asking this question when I've already provided the answer hundreds of times? Why are you so desperate to believe the people who you already recognize are harming our children? Why would Walter Reed be any more trustworthy than Paul Offit or Senator Pan? Why would Jenner or Pasteur? And you went no way to explaining my arguments against germ theory. If we are attacked by billions of viruses every day then if even a tiny fraction of them are pathogenic then we couldn't possibly survive."

Hundreds of thousands of oxycodone pills were sent from Ohio distributors to Florida pharmacies. Unknown thousands of pills headed right back up to Ohio. When Ohio police burst into Christopher Thompson’s home outside Columbus, they found an assault rifle, $80,000 in cash and oxycodone from his Florida deals. A construction worker whose own pill habit started at age 14, Thompson oversaw a ring of 15 Ohio buyers who traveled to Florida to pick up oxycodone to resell in Central Ohio. Two hours to the west in Martin’s Ferry, David L. Kidd orchestrated a ring of buyers traveling to West Palm Beach and Central Florida to pick up oxycodone for resale on the streets of eastern Ohio and West Virginia. Doctors and pharmacies from Florida were complicit with Kidd’s ring in fueling Ohio’s opioid epidemic, wrote the U.S. attorney for West Virginia after Kidd’s 2011 arrest: “The steady flow of pain pills into the Ohio Valley from Florida must stop.” Driving To Pick Up Death By Rx\nWith more drugs came more deaths, in January 2010, say police, Fort Lauderdale pathologist Dr. Lynn Averill started a seven-month oxycodone shopping spree, buying 437,880 oxycodone pills from drug distributors.

      "D) Environmental variability primarily influences the structure of plasticity rules in static agents, while in embodied agents, it primarily affects the variety of well-functioning learning rules."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "The agents perform equally well in this variation of the task as before (Fig. ), but now, the evolved plasticity rules seem to be more structured (Fig. ). Moreover, the variance of the learned weights in the bestperforming agents is significantly reduced (Fig. ), which indicates that the bottleneck in the sensory network is in-creasing selection pressure for rules that learn the environment's food distribution accurately. We find that different sources of variability have a strong impact on the extent to which evolving agents will develop neuronal plasticity mechanisms for adapting to their environment. A diverse environment, a reliable sensory system, and a rate of environmental change that is neither too large nor too small are necessary conditions for an agent to be able to effectively adapt via synaptic plasticity. Additionally, we find that minor variations of the task an agent has to solve or the parametrization of the network can give rise to significantly different plasticity rules. Our results partially extend to embodied artificial agents performing a foraging task. We show that environmental variability also pushes the development of plasticity in such agents. Still, in contrast to the static agents, we find that the interaction of a static motor network with a plastic sensory network gives rise to a much greater variety of wellfunctioning learning rules. We propose a potential cause of this degeneracy; as the relatively complex motor network is allowed to read out and process the outputs from the plastic network, any consistent information coming out of these outputs can be potentially interpreted in a behaviorally useful way. Reducing the information the motor network can extract from the sensory system significantly limits learning rule variability. Our findings on the effect of environmental variability concur with the findings of previous studies that have identified the constraints that environmental variability places on the evolutionary viability of learning behaviors."

      "Indeed, only four ('stablecoin\", \"scrypt\", \"fantom-ecosystem\" and \"alameda-research-portfolio\") out of the fifty groupings have both distributions indistinguishable under a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (p-value > 0.05). Focusing now on the evolution of the power-law exponents quantified by the time series α t for positive and negative returns, we ask whether these exponents present particular time trends. For Bitcoin [Fig. )], α t seems to increase with time for both positive and negative returns. At the same time, the results of Fig. also suggest that market capitalization affects these power-law exponents. To verify these possibilities, we assume the power-law exponents (α t ) to be linearly associated with the cryptocurrency's age (y t , measured in years) and the logarithm of market capitalization (log c t ). As detailed in the Methods section, we frame this problem using a hierarchical Bayesian model. This approach assumes that the linear coefficients associated with the effects of age (A) and market capitalization (C) of each digital currency are drawn from distributions with means µ A and µ C and standard deviations σ A and σ C , which are in turn distributed according to global distributions representing the overall impact of these quantities on the cryptocurrency market. The Bayesian inference process consists of estimating the posterior probability distributions of the linear coefficients for each cryptocurrency as well as the posterior distributions of µ A , µ C , σ A , and σ C , allowing us to simultaneously probe asset-specific tendencies and overall market characteristics. Moreover, we restrict this analysis to the 2140 digital currencies having more than 50 observations of market capitalization concomitantly to the time series of the power-law exponents in order to have enough data points for detecting possible trends. When considering the overall market characteristics, we find that the 94% highest density intervals for µ A ([-0.01, 0.06] for positive and [-0.02, 0.03] for negative returns) and µ C ([-0.02, 0.03] for positive and [-0.001, 0.04] for negative returns) include the zero (see Supplementary Figure for their distributions)."

But, that being said, most of them usually work for a period of time to prevent the targeted diseases. The basic science behind vaccines is correct. Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared? In the case of the routine childhood diseases, this was a bad thing, but it is a true thing. Vaccines usually don't cause any obvious reactions. While they usually prevent the diseases, and that's why people continue to get them. With the increasing vaccination schedule, more and more are severely and permanently damaged, and it is immoral to mandate any vaccine for anyone for this reason. But it would also be immoral to prohibit vaccines for those who want them enough to take the risk. Your article said as though it had any probative value that 90% of those who get pertussis had been vaxxed. The old DPT vaccine was MUCH more effective at preventing pertussis, but it was so dangerous (again, not to most, but to many), that developed countries replaced it with the acellular version, DTaP. From the beginning about twenty years ago, it was clear that it was not very effective and that huge numbers of vaxxed people got pertussis anyway, including my daughter who got pertussis at eight month old after having gotten three DTaPs."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "[37, 38]. Strengthening Indonesia’s existing MPA network for shark conservation, such as making all MPAs no-take zones for sharks and expanding spatial protection to critical shark habitat, including aggregation sites or pupping and nursery grounds for species of conservation concern, could have considerable conservation benefits. It should be noted, however, that MPAs may only be effective for certain species, such as those with small ranges or site-fidelity . More research is required to identify critical shark habitat and life history stages. For Tanjung Luar these efforts could focus on better understanding scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) aggregation sites. Well-targeted spatial closures for this species could significantly reduce catch of threatened species in this fishery. The relationships between gear type, several aspects of fishing effort (i.e. hook number, engine power, number of sets, trip length), standardised CPUE of all shark species and standardised CPUE of threatened and regulated species suggest that there is an optimal effort that could increase overall CPUE of the fishery and significantly reduce fishing mortality of species of conservation concern. For example, our data suggest that CPUE peaks with low to intermediate trip lengths and gear sets, intermediate engine power and hook numbers of less than 75 per set longline. Although standardised CPUE of threatened and regulated species is also higher when fewer hooks are deployed, the catch per set and overall mortality is significantly lower. Regulations that control the number of hooks in combination with incentives for shark fishers to tightly manage the number of hooks they deploy could significantly reduce mortality of threatened and endangered species, maximise the overall CPUE of the fishery, and reduce operational costs for fishers, making shark fishing in Tanjung Luar more sustainable and more cost effective [39–41]. Acknowledging that almost half of Tanjung Luar’s shark catch consists of CITES-listed species, developing measures that ensure both the sustainability of the fishery, and full traceability and control of onward trade, will be crucial for implementing CITES ."

    "correct_answer": "C",

      "The discrete Boltzmann equation for component σ is (C.1) In Eq. C.1 there are two equilibrium distribution functions, i.e., f σ ,seq = f σ ,seq (ρ σ , u σ , T σ ) and f σ ,eq = f σ ,eq (ρ σ , u, T ). For convenience, S σ i is defined as We perform the CE expansion around the f σ ,seq . That is, the distribution function f σ i can be expanded as where ε is a coefficient referring to Knudsen number. The partial derivatives of time and space can also be expanded to Substituting the above four equations into Eq.\n(C.1), we can obtain (C.6) When retaining to ε terms, the following equation is obtained When retaining to ε 2 terms, we can obtain where M 2,αβ ( f σ ,(1) ) = ∑ i v iα v iβ f σ ,(1) i and M 3,1,α ( f σ ,(1) ) = . Substituting Eq. (C.14) into the above three equations, and replacing the time derivatives with the space derivatives, we obtain It should be noted that the ability to recover the corresponding level of macroscopic fluid mechanics equations is only part of the physical function of DBM. The corresponding to the physical functions of DBM is the EHEs, which, in addition to the conserved moments evolution equations corresponding to the three conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy, also includes some of the most closely related nonconserved moments evolution equations. We refer the EHEs derivation based on kinetic equation to as KMM. The necessity of the expanded part, the evolution equations of the relevant non-conserved moments, increases rapidly as increasing the degree of non-continuity/non-equilibrium. As the degree of non-continuity/non-equilibrium increases, the complexity will rapidly make KMM simulation studies, deriving and solving EHE, impossible."

Results are averaged over 50 runs and the area filled represents one standard deviation above and below the mean value. The goal-only baseline shows an over-confident prediction (shown by the strong reduction in belief entropy) that the correct goal is less likely, making it more difficult to reach the correct goal compared to a method that accounts for path preference. Success rates in the simple environment (Map 1).The results are averaged over 6 randomly sampled problem instances (start location, goal location, and goal possibilities), and over 50 runs per problem instance.∆T is the number of time steps separating two consecutive human inputs. The robot's mission time is Tmax = 30 time steps. We selected γ h = 1.5, corresponding to relatively noisy human inputs and making the problem more difficult to solve for the robot.

      "\\section{Introduction}\\label{S1}\n\nThe multiple access interferences (MAI) is the root of user\nlimitation in CDMA systems \\cite{R1,R3}. The parallel least mean\nsquare-partial parallel interference cancelation (PLMS-PPIC) method\nis a multiuser detector for code division multiple access (CDMA)\nreceivers which reduces the effect of MAI in bit detection. In this\nmethod and similar to its former versions like LMS-PPIC \\cite{R5}\n(see also \\cite{RR5}), a weighted value of the MAI of other users is\nsubtracted before making the decision for a specific user in\ndifferent stages \\cite{cohpaper}. In both of these methods, the\nnormalized least mean square (NLMS) algorithm is engaged\n\\cite{Haykin96}. The $m^{\\rm th}$ element of the weight vector in\neach stage is the true transmitted binary value of the $m^{\\rm th}$\nuser divided by its hard estimate value from the previous stage. The\nmagnitude of all weight elements in all stages are equal to unity. Unlike the LMS-PPIC, the PLMS-PPIC method tries to keep this\nproperty in each iteration by using a set of NLMS algorithms with\ndifferent step-sizes instead of one NLMS algorithm used in LMS-PPIC. In each iteration, the parameter estimate of the NLMS algorithm is\nchosen whose element magnitudes of cancelation weight estimate have\nthe best match with unity. In PLMS-PPIC implementation it is assumed\nthat the receiver knows the phases of all user channels. However in\npractice, these phases are not known and should be estimated. In\nthis paper we improve the PLMS-PPIC procedure \\cite{cohpaper} in\nsuch a way that when there is only a partial information of the\nchannel phases, this modified version simultaneously estimates the\nphases and the cancelation weights. The partial information is the\nquarter of each channel phase in $(0,2\\pi)$.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section \\ref{S4}\nthe modified version of PLMS-PPIC with capability of channel phase\nestimation is introduced. In section \\ref{S5} some simulation\nexamples illustrate the results of the proposed method."

      "This issue has been fixed. Captain America WW2 has started to become outpaced by his non-WW2 counterpart and while we want the two to feel different and each have their own specific uses, we also want to ensure they are kept within range of each other in terms of balance. To accomplish this, we’ve given WW2 Cap the ability to Stun with his Special 1 and Special 3 attacks, but kept his Bleed on Special 2 the same, giving him options during combat against non-bleeding champions. A bug that prevented Daredevil from triggering Armor Breaks from Heavy Attacks has been fixed and is now working as intended. Against non-bleeding champions: Critical Hits have a chance to Armor Break on Special Attacks. Increase range of Signature to 25% from 20%. Many players found Elektra’s signature ability lacked enough opportunities to use it. To remedy this, we’ve increased the range from 20% to 25%. Additionally, to help make Elektra unique from other skill champions, we’ve given her the ability to deal with naturally Bleed Immune champions. Note: This Armor Break only applies to champions naturally immune to bleed, such as Colossus and Ultron, and not to champions granted Bleed Immunity from Local or Link Nodes. Guillotine’s Bleed effect used to have a chance to activate from any given attack, meaning that it had to be kept quite weak to compensate for the frequency of triggers. We’ve made the switch to have her Bleed behave closer to existing champions, and in doing so have boosted the strength of the Bleed and have allowed it to stack. Norman Osborn overloads the Arc Reactor in his chest if Health drops below 10%, granting a large burst of power, with (18% - 48% ) Armor, Regeneration, and Power Gain. After that, his suit burns out and cannot trigger Armor Up, Armor Break or Stun and loses all base Armor. Many players didn’t like Iron Patriot’s old signature ability, feeling that due to the lack of Regeneration, it was considerably weaker than Iron Man’s. While we agreed, we didn’t want to just copy and paste his signature ability, but rather give him his own unique twist on the ability."

Both tensile and compressive strains are considered. Let us first discuss the results obtained in the armchair case. Figs. 5(a,b) show that (i) a large conduction gap up to about 500 meV can open with a strain of 6 $\\%$ and (ii) again the conduction gap is strongly $\\theta$-dependent, in particular, its peaks occur at $\\theta = 0$ or $90^\\circ$ while the gap is zero at $\\theta \\approx 47^\\circ$ and $133^\\circ$ for tensile strain and at $\\theta \\approx 43^\\circ$ and $137^\\circ$ for compressive strain. In principle, the conduction gap is larger if the shift of Dirac points in the $\\kappa_y$-axis is larger, as discussed above about Figs. 3-4. We notice that the strain-induced shifts can be different for the six Dirac points of graphene \\cite{kitt12} and the gap is zero when there is any Dirac point observed at the same $\\kappa_y$ in the two graphene sections.

      "B) The distance traveled to fishing grounds.",
      "C) The size and horsepower of the fishing vessel.",
      "D) The availability of bait fish like Euthynnus spp. and Rastrellinger spp."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "These vessels are operated by approximately 150 highly-specialised shark fishers, from Tanjung Luar village and Gili Maringkik, who make up roughly 5% of the local fisher population. The shark industry is more profitable than non-shark fisheries, and shark fishers report high household dependency on shark resources, low occupational diversity, and limited capacity and aspirations to move into other fisheries or industries. Surface and bottom longlines are used as the primary fishing gears to target sharks, with pelagic fish (e.g. Euthynnus spp., Rastrellinger spp.) used as bait. Surface and bottom longlines systematically vary in length, depth deployed, number of sets, number of hooks used, and soak times (Table 2). Gear types are typically associated with certain vessel types, and fishers–captain and crew—tend to exhibit preferences for specific gear types. Shark fishers also use gillnets and troll lines as secondary gears, to catch bait and opportunistically target other species, such as grouper, snapper, skipjack and mackerel tuna. Table 2. Characteristics of surface and bottom longlines. The shark fishing vessels can be divided into two broad categories according to fishing behaviour: larger vessels (≥14 m) with higher horsepower (HP) engines spend more time at sea than smaller vessels (≤12m) (p<0.001), and reach fishing grounds outside of West Nusa Tenggara. These vessels primarily fish in southern Sumbawa and Sumba Islands, however, they also reach as far as eastern Flores, Timor Island, and the Java Sea (Fig 1). Larger, higher HP vessels also tend to employ surface longlines (p<0.001), and since they spend more time at sea, have a higher number of sets per trip than smaller vessels (p<0.001). Smaller vessels (≤12 m) with smaller engines tend to remain in waters around West Nusa Tenggara only, carrying out shorter fishing trips using bottom longlines (Table 3). Table 3. Characterisation of the different fishing vessels used to target sharks in Tanjung Luar. During the study period we recorded shark catch from a total of 595 fishing trips."

      "Goodwin returned with San Jacinto to the United States in mid-September 1945 and he was detached in January 1946. He subsequently served in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations until May that year, when he entered the instruction at National War College. Goodwin graduated in June 1947 and served on Secretary's committee for Research on Reorganization. Upon promotion to Rear admiral on April 1, 1949, Goodwin was appointed Chief of Staff and Aide to Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet under Admiral William H. P. Blandy. Revolt of the Admirals\n\nIn April 1949, the budget's cuts and proposed reorganization of the United States Armed Forces by the Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson launched the wave of discontent between senior commanders in the United States Navy. Johnson proposed the merging of the Marine Corps into the Army, and reduce the Navy to a convoy-escort force. Goodwin's superior officer, Admiral Blandy was call to testify before the House Committee on Armed Services and his harsh statements for the defense of the Navy, costed him his career. Goodwin shared his views and openly criticized Secretary Johnson for having power concentrated in a single civilian executive, who is an appointee of the Government and not an elected representative of the people. He also criticized aspects of defense unification which permitted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to vote on arms policies of individual services, and thus \"rob\" the branches of autonomy. The outbreak of the Korean War in summer 1950 proved the proposal of Secretary Johnson as incorrect and he resigned in September that year. Also Secretary of the Navy, Francis P. Matthews resigned one month earlier. Later service\n\nDue to the Revolts of the admirals, Blandy was forced to retire in February 1950 and Goodwin was ordered to Newport, Rhode Island for temporary duty as Chief of Staff and Aide to the President of the Naval War College under Vice admiral Donald B. Beary in April 1950. Goodwin was detached from that assignment two months and appointed member of the General Board of the Navy."

    "question": "Given the challenges of working with \"undevelopable\" surfaces and the need for precise shaping, what is the primary reason the fuselage longerons take on an elliptical shape during construction?",

      "A) The longerons are intentionally shaped elliptically to improve aerodynamic efficiency.",
      "B) The use of plywood, which is a developable material, necessitates a cylindrical shape for the fuselage.",

      "D) The elliptical shape of the longerons is a byproduct of the marine-inspired construction techniques used in the aircraft."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "Second, understand that the dimensions called for in the plans put a twist in the sides that tends to work the panel in two directions of curvature. This twist makes the panel \"undevelopable\" meaning that that shape cannot be unrolled into an equivalent flat shape. This is important when laying out the side and bottom panels onto flat plywood. To illustrate this, try forming a piece of paper around a soda can. The paper can be formed flat around the can either straight or at a diagonal to it's length. It has only one direction of curvature and is by definition \"developable\". Now try to form the same piece of paper around a baseball. It won't lie flat on the surface without some deformation (folding, wrinkling or tearing) of the paper. The ball has curvature in more that one direction and is a \"compounded\" shape. Paper (or plywood) can only be readily formed in developable shapes as opposed to aluminum or other metal which can accept in plane deformation. A developable surface is needed to lay out a curved surface when the materials used can't be deformed with any degree of in-plane strain. Initially, the fuselage sides are laid out flat with reference to the top longeron measured to a straight chalk line. The bowing problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. If the sides were not sloped (tumbled home) , the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. Since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is now conical. When a conical shape is cut with a plane (building surface) not perpendicular to it's axis, the shape formed is elliptical -- exactly what happens with the top longeron. When it's built flat, bent to form a cylindrical section, and sloped to form a conical section, it takes on an elliptical shape firewall to tailstock. This method borrows heavily from proven techniques used in the marine trades. It should be stressed at this point that although the layout procedure is not complicated, it is important to take your time."

      "An FM station, KSTP-FM, was founded in 1946 but shut down in 1952. Hubbard reportedly acquired an RCA TV camera in 1939, and started experimenting with television broadcasts. But World War II put a hold on the development of television. In 1948, with the war over, KSTP-TV became the first television station in Minnesota. With KSTP 1500 already associated with NBC Radio, KSTP-TV became an NBC Television Network affiliate. From 1946 to 1952, KSTP also had an FM counterpart. KSTP-FM 102.1 was only on the air four years. There were few radios equipped to receive FM signals in that era, and management decided to discontinue FM broadcasts. MOR and Top 40\nAs network programming moved from radio to television, KSTP programmed a full service Middle of the Road (MOR) radio format, in the shadow of its chief competitor, CBS Radio affiliate 830 WCCO. In 1965, a new FM station, reviving the KSTP-FM call sign, was put on the air, largely simulcasting the AM station. But by the late 1960s, KSTP-FM began a separate format of beautiful music. KSTP was the radio home of the Minnesota Vikings football team from 1970 to 1975. In 1973, KSTP broke away from its longtime adult MOR sound and became one of four area stations at the time to program a Top 40 format. \"15 KSTP, The Music Station\" competed with Top 40 AM rivals WDGY, KDWB and later, WYOO. The competition would eventually shake itself out, with outrageous rocker WYOO dropping out after being sold in 1976, and then the staid WDGY switching to country music the following year. As for uptempo hits station 15 KSTP, it went from a tight Top 40 format to leaning adult rock in 1978, to leaning adult contemporary in 1979, to evolving into adult contemporary/talk by 1980. In 1982, it officially shifted to talk. Most Top 40 rock music, by this time, had moved to the FM band. Past Personalities\n\nNotable hosts who have been on KSTP include John Hines, Jesse Ventura, Larry Carolla, Tom Barnard, Big Al Davis, Don Vogel, John MacDougall, Griff, Mike Edwards, Geoff Charles, Joe Soucheray, James Lileks, Leigh Kamman, Barbara Carlson, Peter Thiele, Tom Mischke, Jason Lewis, Chuck Knapp, Machine Gun Kelly, Charle Bush, Mark O'Connell and Paul Brand."

    "documentation": [
      "In order to make it presentable, I have a few more steps I go through, and these typically take me a week all by themselves. My goal is to make the sermon sound as natural and engaging as possible. First, I read the sermon out loud and mark anything that doesn’t sound like me. Maybe I was copying someone’s tone, or more likely my tone was too formal or too informal for the moment. I also italicize the words I want to emphasize. It’s all about the sound. Second, I memorize the sermon. (Yes, the whole thing.) This is what they trained us to do in seminary, and I thought it was overkill. Yes, you can get better eye contact, step away from the podium, I get that. But what I’ve discovered is that when I memorize my work it polishes the sermon like nothing else. If I can’t remember what I’m about to say, how can I expect the congregation to remember? Memorizing forces me to find the best words for the job. It also helps me on a structural level, because if I can’t remember what I was about to say next, it shows that there’s a weak connection between the two points. In a compelling script, the next thing has to follow the last. Once you know why the two are married, you can go back and make it more obvious to the congregation. As I memorize, I boil down the transcript into a preaching outline, which has just enough structure and content to cue me if my mind goes blank in the pulpit. It will have the necessary structural elements, markers for key phrases, and all condensed so that it fits on just a few pages on the platform. (One danger is if I don’t use it in practice, it’s less helpful on Sunday.) Third—and frankly this is the step I’m most likely to skip—I try to choreograph my movements. I believe good preaching is theater, but not in the sense that you’re dramatizing the text. Your whole body is communicating whether you want it to or not, so your gestures should be purposeful. Use the space to organize thoughts, repeat certain motions when you repeat the same thought, make sure you’re not sending mixed signals."

Language Identification Models\n\nMany multilingual language identification models have been developed in order to classify the language of the input sentence beforehand.

      "In order to study the potential role of these proteins in controlling dendritic spine morphologies/number, the use of cultured cortical neurons offers several advantages. Firstly, this system allows for high-resolution imaging of dendritic spines in fixed cells as well as time-lapse imaging of live cells. Secondly, this in vitro system allows for easy manipulation of protein function by expression of mutant proteins, knockdown by shRNA constructs, or pharmacological treatments. These techniques allow researchers to begin to dissect the role of disease-associated proteins and to predict how mutations of these proteins may function in vivo. Play ButtonIsolation and Culture of Mouse Cortical AstrocytesAuthors: Sebastian Schildge, Christian Bohrer, Kristina Beck, Christian Schachtrup. Institutions: University of Freiburg , University of Freiburg .Astrocytes are an abundant cell type in the mammalian brain, yet much remains to be learned about their molecular and functional characteristics. In vitro astrocyte cell culture systems can be used to study the biological functions of these glial cells in detail. This video protocol shows how to obtain pure astrocytes by isolation and culture of mixed cortical cells of mouse pups. The method is based on the absence of viable neurons and the separation of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia, the three main glial cell populations of the central nervous system, in culture. Representative images during the first days of culture demonstrate the presence of a mixed cell population and indicate the timepoint, when astrocytes become confluent and should be separated from microglia and oligodendrocytes. Moreover, we demonstrate purity and astrocytic morphology of cultured astrocytes using immunocytochemical stainings for well established and newly described astrocyte markers. This culture system can be easily used to obtain pure mouse astrocytes and astrocyte-conditioned medium for studying various aspects of astrocyte biology.

The error is seen to sharply rise al low temperature, incidentally, in the ordered case, for  $T<T_c \\sim 0.893$, which is the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature of the 2XY model\\cite{Olsson92}.

Here, we see a clear consequence of the higher-order dependence of Penning fraction - and thus the NO$^+$ ion - NO$^*$ Rydberg molecule balance - on $n_0$, the $\\omega_2$-selected Rydberg gas initial principal quantum number. This Penning-regulated NO$^+$ ion - NO$^*$ Rydberg molecule balance appears necessary as a critical factor in achieving the long ultracold plasma lifetime required to produce this signal. We are progressing in theoretical work that explains the stability apparently conferred by this balance.  \n\n\n\\subsection{Bifurcation and arrested relaxation}\n\nAmbipolar expansion quenches electron kinetic energy as the initially formed plasma expands. Core ions follow electrons into the wings of the Rydberg gas. There, recurring charge exchange between NO$^+$ ions and NO$^*$ Rydberg molecules redistributes the ambipolar force of the expanding electron gas, equalizing ion and Rydberg velocities. This momentum matching effectively channels electron energy through ion motion into the overall $\\pm x$ motion of gas volumes in the laboratory. The internal kinetic energy of the plasma, which at this point is defined almost entirely by the ion-Rydberg relative motion, falls. Spatial correlation develops, and over a period of 500 ns, the system forms the plasma/high-Rydberg quasi-equilibrium dramatically evidenced by the SFI results in Figure \\ref{fig:SFI}. \\begin{figure}[h!] \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width= .4 \\textwidth]{Bifurcation.pdf}\n   \\caption{$x,y$ detector images of ultracold plasma volumes produced by 2:1 aspect ratio ellipsoidal Rydberg gases with selected initial state, $40f(2)$ after a flight time of 402 $\\mu$s over a distance of 575 mm.

      "Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker. A hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface. The field is therefore zero at all places inside the body.:88 This is the operating principal of the Faraday cage, a conducting metal shell which isolates its interior from outside electrical effects. The principles of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite limit to the electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30 kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1 kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field in the air to greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100 MV and have discharge energies as great as 250 kWh. A pair of AA cells. The + sign indicates the polarity of the potential difference between the battery terminals. The concept of electric potential is closely linked to that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity.:494–98 This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points."

In its zeal to update the Constitution for “the Cyber Age,”89× 89. Id. at 2097. the Court deleted Congress from stare decisis doctrine in constitutional cases. The Court had better options. It could have left Quill on Congress’s doorstep, as the dissent argued. Or it could have justified overruling Quill notwithstanding the special force of stare decisis. Instead, the Court reasoned that it doesn’t matter whether Congress is willing and able to do the job: a constitutional mess calls for a judicial clean-up crew. For constitutional default rules — a category of decisions embracing the dormant commerce clause and sweeping far beyond — Wayfair’s new theory of stare decisis makes the Court’s precedents less sticky and Congress less relevant."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "This question veritably answers itself. Only a madman would deny the evidence of his own senses. It is essential to understand that the correspondence of which I speak depends on the reality of motion [from which we derive the ideas of time and space]. To keep ourselves safe, it is necessary that we have the ability to know when a material object is moving closer or further from us and to be able to recognize an object as a danger. This, the senses give us, for perceptions like all other experiences are memories [are preserved over time]. An object is recognized as a danger through prior sensory experiences preserved as long-term memories. In order to be recognized and remembered as a danger, a material object must have the power to produce a particular human experience of it. That power is part of the nature of the object and is thus truly reflected in the perception of it—even though there may be more to the object than its power to yield a human perception. To the reasonable mind, the above comments may properly be seen as statements of the obvious. The curious fact, however, is that a whole school of western philosophy has labored mightily to deny the obvious. I agree; I'm only delving into the inner experience to see how it works and what may become of that.\nby TheVat on April 22nd, 2018, 11:57 am\nRJG, this tablet ate the quoted part of your post and somehow hid the submit button, so sorry about the missing comment.... No, I was not assuming the in-the-moment knowledge, but rather that facts about buses are physically verifiable when science is applied. It is not difficult to verify that I was neither dreaming nor hallucinating. We are saved from solipsism by the multiplicity of observers and their reports. We can open a book and read complex prose (something that can't be done in dreams) that reveals areas of knowledge utterly unknown to us and beyond our previous experiences. We have senses enhanced by instruments that can show us photons leaving the photosphere of the sun and bouncing off solid objects like buses in particular and regular patterns, etc."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "Panels (c) and (d) show the distributions of these median exponents when considering the top 2000 and the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, respectively. We observe that the distributions of α+ and α− tend to shift toward larger values when considering the largest cryptoassets. number of return observations (between 100 and 300 days) and filtering out cryptoassets with missing observations (Supplementary Figures ). Still, it is worth noticing the existence of a few cryptoassets (9 of them) with relatively small market capitalization (ranking below the top 1000) for which the power-law hypothesis is always rejected (Supplementary Table ). Having verified that large price movements in the cryptocurrency market are generally well-described by powerlaw distributions, we now focus on the power-law exponents that typically characterize each cryptoasset. To do so, we select all exponent estimates over the entire history of each digital asset for which the power-law hypothesis is not rejected and calculate their median values for both the positive ( α+ ) and negative ( α− ) returns. The dashed lines in Fig. ) show these median values for Bitcoin where α+ = 4.50 and α− = 2.99. It is worth noticing that the variance of large price movements σ 2 is finite only for α > 3, as the integral σ 2 ∼ ∞ r min r 2 p(r)dr diverges outside this interval. Thus, while the typical variance of large positive returns is finite for Bitcoin, negative returns are at the limit of not having a typical scale and are thus susceptible to much larger variations. Figure shows the probability distribution for the median power-law exponents of all cryptoassets grouped by large positive and negative returns. We note that the distribution of typical power-law exponents associated with large positive returns is shifted to smaller values when compared with the distribution of exponents related to large negative returns. The medians of these typical exponents are respectively 2.78 and 3.11 for positive and negative returns."

      "D) The landowner's decision to lease lots for construction in the early 1730s resulted in a haphazard arrangement of houses, making it difficult to establish a consistent numbering system."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "Few of them were rated at more than a few shillings and many of them were unoccupied.”[1] The landowner, William, 5th Baron Craven, desiring to increase the profitability of his assets, tore down the derelict structures on Spur Alley around 1730 and leased the newly established lots to builders. By 1735, twenty brick houses in the Georgian style had been built on the west side and sixteen on the east side of the way now called Craven Street.[2] Figure 2. Craven Street 1746. (John Rocque London, Westminster and Southwark, First Edition 1746, Motco Enterprises Limited, motco.com)\nLetters to Franklin during his residence with Mrs. Margaret Stevenson, his landlady on Craven Street, were addressed rather vaguely; “Craven Street/Strand”, “Mrs. Stevensons in Craven Street”, or “Benjamin Franklin Esqr.” are but a few examples. Letters from Franklin referenced “London,” or sometimes “Cravenstreet,” but never included a number. Despite the absence of numbered addresses in Franklin’s correspondence, there was a sense of one’s place in the neighborhood based on entries in the Westminster Rate Books (tax assessments). The Rate Books did not list house numbers during Franklin’s time there, but they did list the residents of Craven Street in a particular order that became the default numbering system for the street. Number one was associated with the first resident listed under “Craven Street” in the Rate Books and was the northernmost house on the west side of the street. The numbers increased counter-clockwise down the west side and up the east side in accordance with the list of residents. In 1748, the first year of Margaret Stevenson’s (Stevens in the Rate Books for that year) residence on Craven Street, she is listed as the twenty-seventh resident, the second house north of Court Street (later Craven Court, now Craven Passage) on the east side of the street.[3]\nIn 1766, Parliament passed the London Paving and Lighting Act (6 Geo. 3 c. 26), “An act for the better paving, cleansing, and enlightening, the city of London, and the liberties thereof; and for preventing obstructions and annoyances within the same; and for other purposes therein mentioned."

      "Even doses in rats as high as 250 mg/kg, body weight did not alter the tendency for blood-clot formation to occur.[14]\nUnlike the safe natural forms of vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 and their various isomers, a synthetic form of vitamin K, vitamin K3 (menadione), is demonstrably toxic at high levels. The U.S. FDA has banned this form from over-the-counter sale in the United States because large doses have been shown to cause allergic reactions, hemolytic anemia, and cytotoxicity in liver cells.[2]\nPhylloquinone (K1)[15][16] or menaquinone (K2) are capable of reversing the anticoagulant activity of the anticoagulant warfarin (tradename Coumadin). Warfarin works by blocking recycling of vitamin K, so that the body and tissues have lower levels of active vitamin K, and thus a deficiency of vitamin K.\nSupplemental vitamin K (for which oral dosing is often more active than injectable dosing in human adults) reverses the vitamin K deficiency caused by warfarin, and therefore reduces the intended anticoagulant action of warfarin and related drugs.[17] Sometimes small amounts of vitamin K are given orally to patients taking warfarin so that the action of the drug is more predictable.[17] The proper anticoagulant action of the drug is a function of vitamin K intake and drug dose, and due to differing absorption must be individualized for each patient.[citation needed] The action of warfarin and vitamin K both require two to five days after dosing to have maximum effect, and neither warfarin or vitamin K shows much effect in the first 24 hours after they are given.[18]\nThe newer anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban have different mechanisms of action that do not interact with vitamin K, and may be taken with supplemental vitamin K.[19][20]\nVitamin K2 (menaquinone). In menaquinone, the side chain is composed of a varying number of isoprenoid residues. The most common number of these residues is four, since animal enzymes normally produce menaquinone-4 from plant phylloquinone. A sample of phytomenadione for injection, also called phylloquinone\nThe three synthetic forms of vitamin K are vitamins K3 (menadione), K4, and K5, which are used in many areas, including the pet food industry (vitamin K3) and to inhibit fungal growth (vitamin K5).[21]\nConversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2[edit]\nVitamin K1 (phylloquinone) – both forms of the vitamin contain a functional naphthoquinone ring and an aliphatic side chain."

Following the United States' entry into World War I in April 1917, Goodwin left the school without receiving the diploma in order to see some combat and enlisted the United States Navy on May 7, 1917. He completed basic training and was assigned to the battleship . Goodwin participated in the training of armed guard crews and engine room personnel as the Atlantic Fleet prepared to go to war and in November 1917, he sailed with the rest of Battleship Division 9, bound for Britain to reinforce the Grand Fleet in the North Sea. Although he did not complete the last year of high school, Goodwin was able to earn an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1918.

      "In particular we are employing a probabilistic decoder The encoder is used to infer the state variables z based on the given data and thus defined in the inference and learning section. Inference and Learning\n\nGiven the probabilistic relations , our goal is to infer the latent variables z 0:T as well as all model parameters θ. We follow a hybrid Bayesian approach in which the posterior of the state variables is approximated using amortized Variational Inference and Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) point-estimates for θ are computed. The application of Bayes' rule for each data sequence x 0:T leads to the following posterior: where p(θ) denotes the prior on the model parameters. In the context of variational inference, we use the following factorization of the approximate posterior i.e. we infer only the mean µ and variance σ for each state variable based on the given data points. This conditional density used for inference is the encoder-counterpart to the probabilistic decoder defined in the section before. It can be readily shown that the optimal parameter values are found by maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) F(q φ (z 0:T ), θ) which is derived in Appendix B. We compute Monte Carlo estimates of the gradient of the ELBO with respect to φ and θ with the help of the reparametrization trick and carry out stochastic optimization with the ADAM algorithm .\n\nResults for the probabilistic extension\n\nWe applied our probabilistic version to the KS-equation. We used the same settings as for the deterministic approach but considered up to 10 complex latent variables. The obtained λ's are in Figure . The probabilistic model allows us to quantify the uncertainty in predictions. In Figure predictions for various time-steps and the respective uncertainty bounds are shown for an unseen initial condition. Due to the chaotic nature of the KS-equation and the small amount of training data, the underlying linear dynamic of our model is only able to capture the full dynamics for a limited time horizon."

      "Survivors passed the mutation onto their offspring, and the trait became established throughout areas where malaria is common. As populations migrated, so did the thalassemia traits. Beta thalassemia trait is seen most commonly in people with the following ancestry: Mediterranean (including North African, and particularly Italian and Greek), Middle Eastern, Indian, African, Chinese, and Southeast Asian (including Vietnamese, Laotian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Cambodian, Malaysian, Burmese, and Indonesian). Alpha-thalassemia trait is seen with increased frequency in the same ethnic groups. However, there are different types of alpha thalassemia traits within these populations. The frequency of hemoglobin H disease and alpha thalassemia major depends on the type of alpha thalassemia trait. The populations in which alpha thalassemia diseases are most common include Southeast Asians and Chinese (particularly Southern Chinese). It is difficult to obtain accurate prevalence figures for various types of thalassemia within different populations. This difficulty arises due to testing limitations in determining exact genetic diagnoses, as well as the fact that many studies have focused on small, biased hospital populations. Two studies reflect prevalence figures that can be helpful counseling families and determining who to screen for beta thalassemia. Between the years of 1990 and 1996, the State of California screened more than 3.1 million infants born in the state for beta thalassemia. Approximately 1 in 114,000 infants had beta thalassemia major, with prevalence rates being highest among Asian Indians (about one in 4,000), Southeast Asians (about one in 10,000), and Middle Easterners (about one in 7,000). Another type of beta thalassemia disease, E/beta thalassemia, was represented in approximately one in 110,000 births, all of which occurred in families of Southeast Asian ancestry. Among Southeast Asians, the prevalence of E/beta thalassemia was approximately one in 2,600 births. This is in keeping with the observation that hemoglobin E trait carrier rates are relatively high within the Southeast Asian population: 16% in a study of 768 immigrants to California, and up to 25% in some specific Southeast Asian populations such as Cambodians."

      "Metabolism first theories of abiogenesis and the study of prebiotic evolution strongly suggest that key features of the life process are located way before the development of self-replicating molecules such as RNA and DNA. On the other hand, perhaps this idea of self-replication can be extended to processes in prebiotic evolution in which there is a catalysis of chemical reactions which replenish the chemical components. After all, self-maintenance is a definitive feature of the life process and would suggest that any life process must include the regeneration of its components. DragonFly » April 23rd, 2018, 1:51 pm wrote: The epistemic cut, the subject/object cut, the mind/matter cut, all are rooted to that original cut at the origin of life. The gap between subjective feeling and objective neural firings didn’t come about with the appearance of brains. It was already there when the first cell started living. Two complementary modes of behavior, two levels of description are inherent in life itself, were present at the origin of life, have been conserved by evolution, and continue to be necessary for differentiating subjective experience from the event itself. That is a mind-boggling idea.” This would only work if you can make a logical connection with this definitive feature of life in a process of self maintenance. I have already suggested a connection between this and consciousness by pointing out that self maintenance requires some kind of awareness of self, both as it is and as it \"should be.\" Without some sort of \"should be\" in some form there can be no self-maintenance. It should be noted that there are numerous quantitative features to this, such as the clarity with which this goal of self as it \"should be\" is represented, the determination/flexibility with which it is adhered to (or in other words the range of circumstances which can be handled in holding to this goal).\nby TheVat on April 24th, 2018, 1:52 pm\nIt seems likely a paramecium does no representing to a self, and is pretty much a cellular machine lacking sentience."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "Our control algorithm could also be applied to different hands as it does not depend on the hands configuration. Finally, in previous approaches only lifting tasks had been considered. In our work we demonstrate that our approach can be used to perform more complex tasks, such as placing objects on surfaces and performing handovers, which was not done in previous works. Our goal in this work is to design a control algorithm for an anthropomorphic robotic hand to perform dexterous manipulation skills such as lifting and placing down objects. Our control algorithm will use tactile feedback from the force sensors on the fingertips of the hand to decide the forces that need to be applied to the object in each step of the task. Given the desired forces to be applied, the size of the grasp will be computed. Given the grasp size and a desired grasp type, the posture generator will generate a grasp posture, i.e. the hand configuration, such that the force constraints are satisfied. To model the contacts and friction we use Coulombs' law, which states that in order to avoid slip, the normal contact force f n to the contact surface of an object, times the fiction coefficient µ, has to be larger than the tangential force f t :\nµf n ≥ f t You can see an example in Figure , where an object is pressed against a wall by an applied normal force f n , and we have the tangential force f t = mg due to gravity. In order for the object to remain stable we need to apply a normal force: where µ is the friction coefficient between the object and the wall. In the case of a dexterous hand manipulating an object, we want the normal forces applied by all fingers to be greater than the tangential force divided by the friction coefficient of the materials of the object and the fingertip. Since it is hard to accurately compute the friction coefficient between all possible object materials previous works have used multi-modal tactile sensors like the BioTac sensor, which provides information about the pressure, skin deformation, and temperature, to predict slip and based on that signal to increase the applied normal force."

The thermalization is tested looking at the average energy over logarithmic time windows and\nthe acquisition of independent configurations\nstarts only after the system is well thermalized. For the values of the couplings we considered two cases: an ordered case, indicated in the figure as  $J$ ordered (e.g., left column of Fig. \\ref{PL-Jor1}) where the couplings can take values $J_{ij}=0,J$, with $J=1$, \n   and a quenched disordered case, indicated in the figures as  $J$ disordered (e.g., right column of Fig. \\ref{PL-Jor1})\n   where the couplings can take also  negative values, i.e., \n    $J_{ij}=0,J,-J$, with a certain probability. The results here presented were obtained with bimodal distributed $J$s: \n   \n    $P(J_{ij}=J)=P(J_{ij}=-J)=1/2$.  The performances of the PLM have shown not to depend on $P(J)$. \n   \n    We recall that in Sec. \\ref{sec:plm} we used the temperature-rescaled notation, i.e., $J_{ij}$ stands for $J_{ij}/T$. \n   \n    To analyze the performances of the PLM, in Fig. \\ref{PL-Jor1} the inferred couplings, $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm inf}$, are shown on top of the original couplings,  $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm true}$.\n     The first figure (from top) in the left column shows  the $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm inf}$ (black) and the $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm tru}$ (green) for a given spin\n     at temperature $T/J=0.7$ and number of samples  $M=1024$.

In the left column of Fig.  \\ref{PL-Jor1},  both the $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm{inf}}$ and the $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm{tru}}$ are sorted in decreasing order and plotted on top of each other.
