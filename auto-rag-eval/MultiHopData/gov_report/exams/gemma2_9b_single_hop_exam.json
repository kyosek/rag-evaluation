      "In addition to our site visits, we selected 12 additional stakeholders that included health care providers or administrators in non-hospital settings across the United States; officials from medical specialty societies; and experts. Specifically, we spoke with (1) health care providers (including physicians or nurses) or administrators from four non-hospital settings in Arizona, Ohio, Washington, and West Virginia, which were selected based on recommendations from stakeholders we interviewed and on the availability of such settings and their experience treating NAS; (2) health care providers from five medical specialty societies, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, MedNAX (a network of physicians that specialize in neonatal care, including NAS treatment), and the National Association of Neonatal Nurses; and (3) three experts, including the authors of published literature we reviewed. We interviewed each of these 32 stakeholders and requested information from stakeholders about treating infants with NAS, including the utilization of available hospital and non-hospital care settings and associated costs of treatment services. For example, we requested protocols for screening and treating infants with NAS from hospital and non-hospital care settings. We reviewed available protocols provided by hospitals and a non-hospital care setting. We also reviewed available information reported by state officials, hospital and non-hospital providers, and state perinatal collaboratives on the utilization of hospital and non-hospital care settings, the facilities\u2019 cost of treating NAS in hospital and non-hospital settings, the lengths of stay for treating infants with NAS, or the amount of Medicaid payments for treating infants with NAS. We discussed the information provided by stakeholders and examined the information for obvious errors. The information obtained from these stakeholders is not generalizable to other states or other hospital and non-hospital settings."

      "D) The expiration of the freeze included in P.L. 112-175 triggered the automatic implementation of the annual pay adjustment."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "The executive order included a 0.5% increase for GS base pay, which automatically lowered the maximum potential Member pay adjustment from 1.1% to 0.5%. As in prior years, schedule 6 of the 2012 executive order listed the pay rate for Members of Congress for the upcoming year. This executive order indicated that an annual adjustment would take effect after the expiration of the freeze included in P.L. 112-175 . As stated above, the annual adjustments take effect automatically if legislation is not enacted preventing them. The executive order, however, by establishing the GS pay adjustment at a lower rate than the scheduled Member pay adjustment, automatically lowered the Member pay adjustment rate since by law Member pay adjustments cannot be higher than GS pay adjustments. Subsequently, a provision in H.R. 8 , the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was enacted on January 2, 2013 ( P.L. 112-240 ), froze Member pay at the 2009 level for 2013. The language was included in S.Amdt. 3448 , a substitute amendment agreed to by unanimous consent. The bill, as amended, passed the Senate (89-8, vote #251) and the House (257-167, roll call #659) on January 1, 2013. This freeze was subsequently reflected in Executive Order 13641, which was signed April 5, 2013. This represented the second time, the first being in 2006, that Member pay was statutorily frozen for only a portion of the following year at the time of the issuance of the executive order. In both instances, the executive order listed new pay rates and indicated an effective date following the expiration of the statutory freeze. Pay adjustments in both years were further frozen pursuant to subsequent laws. As stated above, projected Member pay adjustments are calculated based on changes in the ECI. The projected 2011 adjustment of 0.9% was known when the BLS released data for the ECI change during the 12-month period from December 2008 to December 2009 on January 29, 2010. This adjustment would have equaled a $1,600 increase, resulting in a salary of $175,600."

      "SMCRA allows an individual state or Indian tribe to develop its own program to implement the act if the Secretary of the Interior finds that the program is in accordance with federal law. A state with an approved program is said to have \u201cprimacy\u201d for that program. To obtain primacy, a state or Indian tribe submits to the Secretary of the Interior for approval a program that demonstrates that the state or tribe has the capability of carrying out the requirements of SMCRA. The program must demonstrate that the state or Indian tribe has, among other things, a law that provides for the regulation of the surface effects of coal mining and reclamation in accordance with the requirements of SMCRA, and a regulatory authority with sufficient personnel and funding to do so. Of the 25 states and four Indian tribes that OSMRE identified as having active coal mining in 2017, 23 states had primacy, and OSMRE manages the coal program in 2 states and for the four Indian tribes. SMCRA requires a mine operator to obtain a permit before starting to mine. The permit process requires operators to submit plans describing the extent of proposed mining operations and how and on what timeline the mine sites will be reclaimed. In general, an operator must reclaim the land to a use it was capable of supporting before mining or to an alternative postmining land use that OSMRE or the state regulatory authority deems higher or better than the premining land use. In reclaiming the mine site, operators must comply with regulatory standards that govern, among other things, how the reclaimed area is regraded, replanting of the site, and the quality of water flowing from the site. Specifically: Operators are generally required to return mine sites to their approximate original contour unless the operator receives a variance from the regulatory authority. To return to this contour, the surface configuration achieved by backfilling and grading of the mined area must closely resemble the general surface configuration of the land before mining and blend into and complement the drainage pattern of the surrounding terrain, with all highwalls and spoil piles eliminated."

      "When the 109 th Congress adjourned in December 2006, it had not completed action on appropriations legislation to fund EPA (or on nine other appropriations bills covering the majority of domestic discretionary agencies and departments) for the fiscal year that began October 1, 2006, thus carrying over this legislative activity into the 110 th Congress. In December 2006, Congress enacted a continuing resolution, P.L. 109-383 (the third such continuing resolution since the start of the fiscal year on October 1), providing funds for EPA and the other affected agencies and departments until February 15, 2007. The President's FY2007 budget request for clean water SRF capitalization grants was 22% less than the FY2006 appropriation for these grants and 37% below the FY2005 funding level. The request for drinking water SRF grants was essentially the same as in recent years ($4 million more than FY2006, $1.7 million less than FY2005). As in recent budgets, the Administration proposed no funding for congressionally designated water infrastructure grants, but, as noted above, it did seek a total of $40.6 million for Administration priority projects. Advocates of the clean water SRF program (especially state and local government officials) again contended, as they have for several recent years, that the cuts would impair their ability to carry out needed municipal wastewater treatment plant improvement projects. Administration officials responded that cuts for the clean water SRF in FY2007 were necessary because Congress boosted funds above the requested level in FY2005 and FY2006. On May 18, 2006, the House passed H.R. 5386 ( H.Rept. 109-465 ), providing the requested level of $687.6 million for clean water SRF grants and $841.5 million for drinking water SRF grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the same funding levels for these grant programs when it reported H.R. 5386 on June 29 ( S.Rept. 109-275 ), but the Senate did not act on this measure before the 109 th Congress adjourned in December."

      "IHS was established within the Public Health Service in 1955 to provide health services to members of AI/AN tribes, primarily in rural areas on or near reservations. IHS provides these services directly through a network of hospitals, clinics and health stations, while also providing funds to tribally operated facilities. These federally and tribally operated facilities are located primarily in service areas that are rural, isolated, and underserved. In fiscal year 2017, IHS allocated about $1.9 billion for health services provided by federally and tribally operated facilities. Federally operated IHS facilities, which received over 5.2 million outpatient visits and over 15,000 inpatient admissions in 2016, provide mostly primary and emergency care, as well as some ancillary and specialty services in 26 hospitals, 55 health centers, and 21 health stations. According to IHS, federally operated IHS hospitals range in size from 4 to 133 beds and generally are open 24 hours a day for emergency care needs; health centers offer a range of care, including primary care services and some ancillary services, such as pharmacy, laboratory, and X-ray services, and are open for at least 40 hours a week; and health stations offer only primary care services on a regularly scheduled basis and are open fewer than 40 hours a week. The 12 IHS area offices are responsible for distributing funds to the facilities in their areas, monitoring their operation, and providing guidance and technical assistance (see fig. 1). In addition, five human resources regional offices assist the area offices in the recruitment and hiring of providers. IHS federally operated facilities employ both federal civil service personnel and Commissioned Corps officers. IHS may pay higher salaries for certain federal civil service providers through the development and implementation of special pay tables, which specify the ranges of salaries that these certain providers can receive. According to IHS officials, the Commissioned Corps officers follow the same process for applying for positions at IHS as federal civil service employees."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "One type of legal challenge raised by students accused of sexual misconduct is that the public universities failed to adequately notify them of the charges. As an initial matter, reviewing courts have taken the view that there generally will be no due process violation on notice grounds when the school (1) provides a student with timely notice of the actual, full charges against him; and (2) provides the accused student with a meaningful opportunity to prepare for the disciplinary hearing against him. The absence of such protocols, however, can form the basis of a viable due process claim. For example, at one university, an accused student alleged that he was interviewed by a school staff member assigned to investigate charges of sexual misconduct against him without first being notified of the existence of the sexual misconduct allegation. The student was eventually suspended from the university. A federal district court ruled that, given the severity of the suspension (three years), the lack of notice could amount to a due process violation. The court thus held that the student had stated a claim sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. In another case, an accused student alleged that he was not given adequate notice of the scope of charges against him. Rather, the school only notified him that his conduct on a particular day was under review, but expelled him for sexual misconduct that occurred in relation to other incidents and dates. The federal district court ruled that \"[b]y conveying a limited scope of focus to plaintiff, defendants prejudiced plaintiff's ability to mount an effective defense, which increased the possibility of an erroneous outcome.\" Taken together with other procedural issues in the school's investigation and decision, the court concluded that the school had deprived the student of a liberty interest without due process of law. Similarly, the Sixth Circuit ruled that a student suspended by a university because of suspected sexual assault had sufficiently pleaded a due process violation when the university allegedly did not make available the evidence used in its disciplinary decision against him."

According to the Administration budget request, \"ARPA-E will utilize the remainder of its unobligated balances to execute the multi-year termination of the program, with all operations ceasing by FY 2022.\" The FY2020 budget request for DOE Weapons Activities is 12% greater than the FY2019 enacted level ($12.4 billion vs. $11.1 billion). Weapons Activities programs are carried out by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semiautonomous agency within DOE. Under Weapons Activities, FY2020 funding for nuclear warhead life-extension programs (LEPs) would increase by 10% ($2.1 billion vs $1.9 billion). The two most notable increases within that account are the funding request for W80-4 LEP, which increases by 37% ($898.6 million vs. $654.8 million) and the initiation of funding for the W87-1 LEP. The increase in the request for the W80-4 warhead, which is due to be carried on the new long-range standoff weapon (a new cruise missile), apparently is the result of a new budget estimate, as the Department of Defense is not accelerating development of the missile. The FY2020 request seeks $112 million for the W87-1 warhead (formerly the Interoperable Warhead 1, or IW-I), which received $53 million in FY2019. This warhead is to be carried by the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, a new land-based missile that is scheduled to enter the force in the 2030s. The FY2020 budget request seeks $10 million for the W76-2 LEP, down from $65 million in FY2019. Work on this warhead is nearly complete. It is a low-yield modification of the current W76 warhead carried by U.S. submarine-launched ballistic missiles. It remains controversial in Congress despite its relatively low price tag. In FY2020, NNSA is seeking $51.5 million, in the Stockpile Systems account, for surveillance efforts for the B83 gravity bomb, the most powerful bomb in the U.S. inventory."

    "documentation": [
      "The two issues are ultimately separate from one another because even if all the territorial disputes in the SCS and ECS were resolved, and none of China's claims in the SCS and ECS were accepted, China could continue to apply its concept of its EEZ rights to the EEZ that it unequivocally derives from its mainland coast\u2014and it is in this unequivocal Chinese EEZ that several of the past U.S.-Chinese incidents at sea have occurred. Press reports of maritime disputes in the SCS and ECS sometimes focus on territorial disputes while devoting little or no attention to the EEZ dispute, or do relatively little to distinguish the EEZ dispute from the territorial disputes. From the U.S. perspective, the EEZ dispute is arguably as significant as the maritime territorial disputes because of the EEZ dispute's proven history of leading to U.S.-Chinese incidents at sea and because of its potential for affecting U.S. military operations not only in the SCS and ECS, but around the world. For background information on treaties and international agreements related to the disputes, see Appendix C . For background information on the July 2016 tribunal award in the SCS arbitration case involving the Philippines and China concerning maritime territorial issues in the SCS, see Appendix D . In general, China's approach to the maritime disputes in the SCS and ECS, and to strengthening its position over time in the SCS, can be characterized as follows: China appears to have identified the assertion and defense of its maritime territorial claims in the SCS and ECS, and the strengthening of its position in the SCS, as important national goals. To achieve these goals, China appears to be employing an integrated, whole-of-society strategy that includes diplomatic, informational, economic, military, paramilitary/law enforcement, and civilian elements. In implementing this integrated strategy, China appears to be persistent, patient, tactically flexible, willing to expend significant resources, and willing to absorb at least some amount of reputational and other costs that other countries might seek to impose on China in response to China's actions."

These sample frames were then used as the basis for drawing our non-probability samples of institutions for purposes of interviews, focus group participation, and document review. Defining a community bank is important because, as we have reported, regulatory compliance may be more burdensome for community banks and credit unions than for larger banks because they are not as able to benefit from economies of scale in compliance resources. While there is no single consensus definition for what constitutes a community bank, we reviewed criteria for defining community banks developed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), officials from the Independent Community Bankers Association, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Based on this review, we determined that institutions that had the following characteristics would be the most appropriate to include in our universe of institutions, (1) fewer total assets, (2) engage in traditional lending and deposit taking activities, have limited geographic scope, and (3) did not have complex operating structures. To identify banks that met these characteristics, we began with all banks that filed a Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) for the first quarter of 2016 (March 31, 2016) and are not themselves subsidiaries of another bank that filed a Call Report. We then excluded banks using an asset-size threshold, to ensure we are including only small institutions. Based on interviews with regulators and our review of the FDIC\u2019s community bank study, we targeted institutions around the $1 billion in assets as the group that could be relatively representative of the experiences of many community banks in complying with regulations."

The regulators also received comments on both BSA/AML examination frequency and the frequency of safety and soundness examinations generally. Agencies typically review BSA/AML compliance programs during safety and soundness examinations. As discussed previously, regulators allowed more institutions of outstanding or good composite condition to be examined every 18 months instead of every 12 months. Institutions that qualify for less frequent safety-and-soundness examinations also will be eligible for less frequent BSA/AML examinations. For the remainder of the issues raised by commenters, the regulators noted they do not have the regulatory authority to revise the requirements but provided the comments to FinCEN, which has authority for these regulations. A letter with FinCEN\u2019s response to the comments was included as an appendix of the EGRPRA report. In the letter, the FinCEN Acting Director stated that FinCEN would work through the issues raised by the comments with its advisory group consisting of regulators, law enforcement staff, and representatives of financial institutions. Additional Burden Reduction Actions. In addition to describing some changes in response to the comments deemed significant, the regulators\u2019 2017 report also includes descriptions of additional actions the individual agencies have taken or planned to take to reduce the regulatory burden for banks, including community banks. The Federal Reserve Board noted that it changed its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement that allows small bank holding companies to hold more debt than permitted for larger bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve noted that it had made changes to certain supervisory policies, such as issuing guidance on assessing risk management for banks with less than $50 billion in assets and launching an electronic application filing system for banks and bank holding companies. OCC noted that it had issued two final rules amending its regulations for licensing/chartering and securities-related filings, among other things."

      "Together, the Court found these factors sufficient to uphold the law. In the wake of Whalen and Nixon v. Administrator of General Services \u2014a case decided the same year as Whalen that also considered the right to informational privacy\u2014courts have struggled to articulate the precise contours of the right. The most recent Supreme Court case to consider the right to informational privacy, NASA v. Nelson , went so far as to suggest that the right might not exist, \"assuming without deciding\" that the right existed in the course of rejecting the constitutional claim challenge to a government background check program for hiring. Despite the Supreme Court's lack of clarity about the right to informational privacy, \"most federal circuit courts\" recognize the right to various extents. All of the constitutional rights involving privacy, like the common law privacy torts, focus on public disclosure of private facts. This focus limits their potential influence on modern data privacy debates, which extends beyond the disclosure issue to more broadly concern how data is collected, protected, and used. Perhaps more importantly, whatever the reach of the constitutional right to privacy, the \"state action doctrine\" prevents it from being influential outside the realm of government action. Under this doctrine, only government action is subject to scrutiny under the Constitution, but purely private conduct is not proscribed, \"no matter how unfair that conduct may be.\" As a result, neither the common nor constitutional law provides a complete framework for considering many of the potential threats to digital privacy and consumer data. Rather, the most important data protection standards come from statutory law. Given the inherent limitations in common law and constitutional protections, Congress has enacted a number of federal laws designed to provide statutory protections of individuals' personal information. In contrast with the scheme prevalent in Europe and some other countries, rather than a single comprehensive law, the United States has a \"patchwork\" of federal laws that govern companies' data protection practices."

    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "Although used less frequently than AD/CVD laws, Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \u00a72251 et seq.), is designed to give domestic industry the opportunity to adjust to import competition and remain competitive. The relief provided is generally a temporary import duty and/or quota. Unlike AD/CVD, safeguard laws require presidential action for relief to be put into effect. The dispute settlement system, often called the \"crown jewel\" of the WTO, has been considered by some observers to be one of the most important successes of the multilateral trading system. WTO agreements contain provisions that are either binding or nonbinding. The WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes\u2014Dispute Settlement Understanding or DSU\u2014provides an enforceable means for WTO members to resolve disputes arising under the binding provisions. The DSU commits members not to determine violations of WTO obligations or impose penalties unilaterally, but to settle complaints about alleged violations under DSU rules and procedures. The Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) is a plenary committee of the WTO, which oversees the panels and adopts the recommendation of a dispute settlement panel or Appellate Body (AB) panel. Panels are composed of three (or five in complex cases) panelists\u2014not citizens of the members involved\u2014chosen through a roster of \"well qualified governmental and/or non-governmental individuals\" maintained by the Secretariat. WTO members must first attempt to settle a dispute through consultations, but if these fail, a member seeking to initiate a dispute may request that a panel examine and report on its complaint. A respondent party is able to block the establishment of a panel at the DSB once, but if the complainant requests its establishment again at a subsequent meeting of the DSB, a panel is established. At its conclusion, the panel recommends a decision to the DSB that it will adopt unless all parties agree to block the recommendation. The DSU sets out a timeline of one year for the initial resolution of disputes (see Figure 5 ); however, cases are rarely resolved in this timeframe."

      "State Medicaid agencies also varied in whether they made information on critical incidents and other key information readily available to the public. (See table 5.) Beneficiaries seeking care in an assisted living facility may want to know the number of critical incidents related to a particular facility. Through our survey we found that states differed in the availability of information related to health and welfare that was available to the public. For example, 34 of the 48 states reported that they made critical incident information available to the public by phone, website, or in person, and the remaining 14 states did not have such information available at all. Although all 48 states had information in some form on which assisted facilities accepted Medicaid beneficiaries, 8 states could not provide this information by phone and 22 states could not provide the information in person. In recent years, CMS has taken steps to improve oversight of beneficiary health and welfare in HCBS programs by adding new HCBS waiver application requirements for state monitoring of beneficiary health and welfare. CMS requires state waiver applications to include specific requirements that implement various statutory and regulatory provisions, including a provision that states assure that they will safeguard the health and welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries. In March 2014, CMS added unexplained death to the events that states must be able to identify and address on an ongoing basis, as part of their efforts to prevent instances of abuse, neglect, and exploitation, and added four new requirements for states to protect beneficiary health and welfare. (See table 6.) In its guidance implementing the 2014 requirements, CMS noted that state associations and state representatives\u2019 work groups had agreed that \u201chealth and welfare is one of the most important assurances to track, and requires more extensive tracking to benefit the individuals receiving services, for instance by using data to prevent future incidents.\u201d"

      "\"The nine-dash line can no longer meet the demands of increasing Chinese activities in the South China Sea.\"... The continuous boundary was generated not only by curve-extending, gap-filling algorithms on computer. It was also based on a solid piece of historic evidence, according to the project team. In 1951, an official map approved by the central government of China marked the China-claimed area in the South China Sea with a pair of non-stopping lines. There was an inner black line indicating the sovereign boundary and an outer red line representing where China could exercise administrative power. \"We were thrilled when we found the map,\" the researcher said. \"It is something we can show the world.\" A detailed description of the map was published by the project team in a paper in domestic academic journal China Science Bulletin in March this year. Its authors recommended using the continuous U-shape boundary line as a replacement for the nine-dash line. The \"U-boundary is the border of China's sea in the South China Sea, and its sovereignty belongs to China\", the authors wrote in the paper. It \"can further express the certainty of the integrity, continuity and border of China's seas in the South China Sea\", they wrote, adding that it was \"more vivid, accurate, complete and scientific\". Professor Yu Minyou, director of the China Institute of Boundary and Ocean Studies at Wuhan University, said that if the old map was published with government approval, which was usually the case in China, \"it surely will add legal weight to China's claim\" in the region.... But other countries should bear in mind that it did not represent the Chinese government's position as long as the dash lines stayed on official maps, Yu said, adding that China's strategy for the South China Sea was \"open and clear\". \"China wants to achieve peace, stability, harmony and prosperity in the region,\" he said. \"We are willing to share natural resources with other countries and leave the disputes to be solved in the future."

      "However, federal regulators and consumer advocacy groups said that benefits from these regulations were significant. Representatives of community banks and credit unions in all our focus groups and in most of our interviews told us that HMDA\u2019s data collection and reporting requirements were burdensome. Under HMDA and its implementing Regulation C, banks and credit unions with more than $45 million in assets that do not meet regulatory exemptions must collect, record, and report to the appropriate federal regulator, data about applicable mortgage lending activity. For every covered mortgage application, origination, or purchase of a covered loan, lenders must collect information such as the loan\u2019s principal amount, the property location, the income relied on in making the credit decision, and the applicants\u2019 race, ethnicity, and sex. Institutions record this on a form called the loan/application register, compile these data each calendar year, and submit them to CFPB. Institutions have also been required to make these data available to the public upon request, after modifying them to protect the privacy of applicants and borrowers. Representatives of many community banks and credit unions with whom we spoke said that complying with HMDA regulations was time consuming. For example, representatives from one community bank we interviewed said it completed about 1,100 transactions that required HMDA reporting in 2016, and that its staff spent about 16 hours per week complying with Regulation C. In one focus group, participants discussed how HMDA compliance was time consuming because the regulations were complex, which made determining whether a loan was covered and should be reported difficult. As a part of that discussion, one bank representative told us that it was not always clear whether a residence that was used as collateral for a commercial loan was a reportable mortgage under HMDA. In addition, representatives in all of our focus groups in which HMDA was discussed and in some interviews said that they had to provide additional staff training for HMDA compliance."

    "documentation": [
      "Most committees print the hearings, although no rule requires it. The number of Senators necessary to constitute a quorum for the purpose of taking testimony varies from committee to committee, but it is usually smaller than a majority of the membership. A committee considering a nomination has four options. It may report the nomination to the Senate favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation, or it may choose to take no action at all. It is more common for a committee to take no action on a nomination than to report unfavorably. Particularly for policymaking positions, committees sometimes report a nomination favorably, subject to the commitment of the nominee to testify before a Senate committee. Sometimes, committees choose to report a nomination without recommendation. Even if a majority of Senators on a committee do not agree that a nomination should be reported favorably, a majority might agree to report a nomination without a recommendation in order to permit a vote by the whole Senate. The timing of a vote to report a nomination varies in accordance with committee rules and practice. Most committees do not vote to report a nomination on the same day that they hold a hearing, but instead wait until the next meeting of the committee. Senate Rule XXVI, clause 7(a)(1) requires that a quorum for making a recommendation on a nomination consist of a majority of the membership of the committee. In most cases, the number of Senators necessary to constitute a quorum for making a recommendation on a nomination to the Senate is the same that the committee requires for reporting a measure. Every committee reports a majority of nominations favorably. Most of the time, committees do not formally present reports on nominations on the floor of the Senate. Instead, committee staff prepare the appropriate paperwork on behalf of the committee chair and file it with the clerk. The executive clerk then arranges for the nomination to be printed in the Congressional Record and placed on the Executive Calendar ."

For example, the January 2, 2017, incident was identified in CBP outage reports, but was not captured in the monthly report because it was caused by a change to an external feed to the TECS system. CBP officials clarified that the monthly reports only account for interruptions that result in a full loss of operations for all TECS system users. The OIG recommended that CBP develop a plan to address factors that contributed to challenges regarding availability of primary traveler screening applications, among other things. CBP concurred with the recommendations. On January 1, 2018, the TECS system experienced another major outage that caused long airport delays; CBP officials said this incident is under review. CBP officials provided technical comments on a draft of this assessment, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. LOGISTICS SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (LSCMS) FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA) LSCMS is a computer-based tracking system that FEMA officials use to track shipments during disaster-response efforts.

    "documentation": [
      "In the public university context, a number of students subject to disciplinary sanctions for misconduct thus challenged the disciplinary procedures in state and federal courts as unconstitutional. In particular, a number of students faced with disciplinary action by public universities have raised constitutional challenges to the Title IX procedures used to find them responsible for sexual misconduct, arguing that universities violated the Due Process Clause in the handling of their case. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to observe certain procedures when depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property. In addition to protecting against the deprivation of an individual's physical property, the Constitution guards against the deprivation of certain \"property interests\" without due process. The property interests protected by the Due Process Clause are not themselves created by the Constitution; instead, those interests arise from an independent source, such as state or federal law. To have a protected property interest in a government-created benefit, one must show a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\" that originates in \"existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\" Likewise, when a state deprives an individual of liberty, states must afford due process to the individual. In fact, when a \"person's good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him,\" due process may be implicated. In these circumstances, courts often require an accompanying state action that alters or removes a legal status to constitute a deprivation of liberty. Precisely what procedures are constitutionally required before depriving individuals of a protected interest can vary. When deciding what process is due, courts balance three factors enunciated by the Supreme Court in Ma thews v. Eldridge : (1) \"the private interest that will be affected by the official action\"; (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation and the probable value of additional procedures; and (3) the interest of the government."

      "According to staff at overseas posts, higher numbers of office management specialist vacancies require other Foreign Service employees to spend a significant amount of time on administrative tasks, reducing the amount of time these staff can spend on mission-critical activities. Officials in headquarters and at overseas posts described various State efforts to help address overseas Foreign Service vacancies. According to State officials, Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts are a complex problem that multiple offices within State address on an individual basis. State\u2019s various efforts to address overseas Foreign Service vacancies are not guided by an integrated action plan to reduce persistent vacancies. Our 2017 High-Risk Series report calls for agencies to, among other things, design and implement action plan strategies for closing skills gaps. The action plan should (1) define the root cause of all skills gaps within an agency and (2) provide suggested corrective measures, including steps necessary to implement solutions. This report also emphasizes the high risk that mission-critical skills gaps in the federal workforce pose to the nation. While various State offices have implemented the efforts we identified, State lacks an action plan that is integrated\u2014or consolidated\u2014across its relevant offices to guide its efforts to address persistent overseas Foreign Service vacancies. Moreover, some staff at overseas posts acknowledged that the efforts State has taken to help address vacancies have not reduced persistent Foreign Service vacancies, notably in specialist positions. In response to our inquiry about an action plan, State officials said that the agency does not have a single document that addresses Foreign Service staffing gaps at overseas posts. Instead, State officials directed us to State\u2019s Five Year Workforce Plan: Fiscal Years 2016-2020, stating that it was the most comprehensive document that outlines State\u2019s efforts to address Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts."

      "In addition, as discussed below, FTC can seek to impose civil monetary penalties directly for violations of certain privacy statutes and regulations such as the statute pertaining to the Internet privacy of children and its implementing regulations. Although FTC can levy civil penalties up to $41,484 per violation, per day, against an entity that violates a trade regulation rule under the FTC Act, it has not promulgated trade regulation rules under section 5 specific to privacy. Although FTC has not implemented its section 5 authority by issuing regulations regarding Internet privacy, it has issued regulations to implement other statutory authorities. Likewise, other federal agencies use regulations to implement the statutes they are charged with administering. The process by which federal agencies typically develop and issue regulations is spelled out in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Section 553 of the APA establishes procedures and requirements for what is known as \u201cinformal\u201d rulemaking, also known as notice-and- comment rulemaking. Among other things, section 553 generally requires agencies to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register. After giving interested persons an opportunity to comment on the proposal by providing \u201cdata, views, or arguments,\u201d the statute then requires the agency to publish the final rule in the Federal Register. Regulations may be enforced in various ways, for example, by seeking civil penalties for non-compliance. FTC has authority to seek civil penalties, for example, when a company knowingly violates a regulation or, as discussed below, a final consent order. In contrast to the APA section 553 rulemaking process, the rulemaking process that FTC generally must follow to issue rules under the FTC Act is spelled out in the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act amendments to the FTC Act (Magnuson-Moss). The Magnuson-Moss amendments\u2014 enacted in 1975 partly in response to industry opposition to FTC\u2019s trade regulations, and amended in 1980\u2014require additional rulemaking steps beyond APA section 553."

      "The SCS, ECS, and Yellow Sea border three U.S. treaty allies\u2014Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. In addition, the SCS and ECS (including the Taiwan Strait) surround Taiwan, regarding which the United States has certain security-related policies under the Taiwan Relations Act ( H.R. 2479 / P.L. 96-8 of April 10, 1979), and the SCS borders Southeast Asian nations that are current, emerging, or potential U.S. partner countries, such as Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia. In a conflict with the United States, Chinese bases in the SCS and forces operating from them would add to a regional network of Chinese anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) forces intended to keep U.S. military forces outside the first island chain (and thus away from China's mainland). Among other things, Chinese bases in the SCS and forces operating from them could help create a bastion (i.e., a defended operating sanctuary) in the SCS for China's emerging sea-based strategic deterrent force of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). In a conflict with the United States, Chinese bases in the SCS and forces operating from them would be vulnerable to U.S. attack. Attacking the bases and the forces operating from them, however, would tie down the attacking U.S. forces for a time at least, delaying the use of those U.S. forces elsewhere in a larger conflict, and potentially delay the advance of U.S. forces into the SCS. Short of a conflict with the United States, Chinese bases in the SCS, and more generally, Chinese domination over or control of its near-seas region could help China to do one or more of the following on a day-to-day basis: control fishing operations and oil and gas exploration activities in the SCS; coerce, intimidate, or put political pressure on other countries bordering on the SCS; announce and enforce an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over the SCS; announce and enforce a maritime exclusion zone (i.e., a blockade) around Taiwan; facilitate the projection of Chinese military presence and political influence further into the Western Pacific; and help achieve a broader goal of becoming a regional hegemon in its part of Eurasia."

      "The Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988 established the foundation for the current U.S. policy to potentially provide federal payment for a portion of claims by third parties for injury, damage, or loss that results from a commercial launch or reentry accident. A stated goal of the act was to provide a competitive environment for the U.S. commercial space launch industry. The act also provided for, among other things, government protection against some losses\u2014referred to as indemnification\u2014while still minimizing the cost to taxpayers. All FAA- licensed commercial launches and reentries by U.S. companies, whether unmanned or manned and from the United States or overseas, are covered by federal indemnification for third-party damages that result from the launch or reentry. According to agency officials, in 2016 FAA issued five active licenses, which had an average third-party MPL of about $51 million and ranged from $10 million to $99 million. The amount of insurance coverage that FAA requires launch companies to purchase\u2014the MPL value\u2014is intended to reflect the greatest dollar amount of loss to third parties and the federal government for bodily injury and property damage that can be reasonably expected to result from a launch or reentry accident. FAA calculates separate MPL values for potential damages to third parties and the federal government. For each launch license that it issues, FAA determines MPL values for third parties with the intent of estimating the greatest dollar amount of losses that reasonably could be expected from a launch or reentry accident, which have no less than a 1 in 10 million chance of occurring. For damages to the federal government, FAA determines MPL values with the intent of estimating the greatest dollar amount of losses that reasonably could be expected from a launch or reentry accident, which have no less than a 1 in 100,000 chance of occurring. According to FAA, the agency defines these probability thresholds to estimate the federal government\u2019s exposure to losses above the MPL."

      "The Multinational Force and Observers, or MFO, are deployed in the Sinai to monitor the terms of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty (see Figure 5 ). Egypt and Israel reportedly continue to cooperate in countering terrorism in the Sinai. In a televised interview, President Sisi responded to a question on whether Egyptian-Israeli military cooperation was the closest it has ever been, saying \"That is correct. The [Egyptian] Air Force sometimes needs to cross to the Israeli side. And that's why we have a wide range of coordination with the Israelis.\" One news account suggests that Israel, with Egypt's approval, has used its own drones, helicopters, and aircraft to carry out more than 100 covert airstrikes inside Egypt against militant targets. In order to counter IS-SP in northern Sinai, the Egyptian armed forces and police have declared a state of emergency, imposed curfews and travel restrictions, and erected police checkpoints along main roads. Authorities also have limited domestic and foreign media access to the northern Sinai, declaring it an active combat zone and unsafe for journalists. According to Jane's Defence Weekly , Egypt may be upgrading an old air base in the Sinai (Bir Gifgafa), where it could deploy Apache attack helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles for use in counterterrorism operations. While an increased Egyptian military presence in the Sinai may be necessary to stabilize the area, many observers have argued that military means alone are insufficient. These critics say that force should be accompanied by policies to reduce the appeal of antigovernment militancy by addressing local political and economic grievances. According to one account: Sinai residents are prohibited from joining any senior post in the state. They cannot work in the army, police, judiciary, or in diplomacy. Meanwhile, no development projects have been undertaken in North Sinai the past 40 years.

      "The next largest groups were visas for students and exchange visitors and temporary workers, which accounted for an average of 9 percent and 6 percent, respectively, of all adjudications during this time period. Although adjudications for visas in some categories increased, others decreased over time. For example, as shown in figure 5, NIV adjudications for temporary workers increased by approximately 50 percent from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 (592,000 to 885,000). During the same time period, adjudications for tourist and business visitors also increased by approximately 20 percent overall (from 8.18 million to 9.97 million), but decreased from fiscal years 2016 to 2017. However, NIV adjudications for student and exchange visitor visas decreased by about 2 percent from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 (1.01 million to 993,000) overall, but experienced a peak in fiscal year 2015 of 1.2 million. Appendix I includes additional information on NIV adjudication by visa group from fiscal years 2012 through 2017. State officials identified reasons to explain these trends: Temporary Workers. Although there was an increase in adjudications across all types of temporary worker visas, the largest percentage increase was for H-2A visas, which are for foreign workers seeking to perform agricultural services of a temporary or seasonal nature. Specifically, adjudications of H-2A visas increased by 140 percent from fiscal years 2012 to 2017 (from about 71,000 to 170,000). State officials noted that H-2A visas are not numerically limited by statute. Further, State officials stated that they believe U.S. employers are increasingly less likely to hire workers without lawful status and are petitioning for lawfully admitted workers, which in part led to an increase in H-2A visa demand. Tourist and Business Visitors. State officials partly attributed the overall changes to tourist and business visitor visas to the extension of the validity period of such visas for Chinese nationals, which represented the largest single country of nationality for tourist and business visitor visas in fiscal year 2017 (17.7 percent)."

      "After official recognition of Guaid\u00f3, the Trump Administration imposed new sanctions under IEEPA to freeze the assets of the main Venezuelan state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (Pdvsa), which could both significantly reduce funds available to the regime of Nicolas Maduro and channel them to Guaid\u00f3. There is also precedent for using frozen foreign assets for purposes authorized by the U.N. Security Council. After the first war with Iraq, President George H.W. Bush ordered the transfer of frozen Iraqi assets derived from the sale of Iraqi petroleum held by U.S. banks to be transferred to a holding account in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to fulfill \"the rights and obligations of the United States under U.N. Security Council Resolution No. 778.\" The President cited a section of the United Nations Participation Act (UNPA), as well as IEEPA, as authority to take the action. The transferred funds were used to provide humanitarian relief and to finance the United Nations Compensation Commission, which was established to adjudicate claims against Iraq arising from the invasion. Other Iraqi assets remained frozen and accumulated interest until they were vested in 2003 (see below). In some cases, the United States has ended sanctions and returned frozen assets to successor governments. In the case of the former Yugoslavia, for example, in 2003, $237.6 million in frozen funds belonging to the Central Bank of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were transferred to the central banks of the successor states. In the case of Afghanistan, $217 million in frozen funds belonging to the Taliban were released to the Afghan Interim Authority in January 2002. The executive branch has traditionally resisted congressional efforts to vest foreign assets to pay U.S. claimants without first obtaining a settlement agreement with the country in question. Congress has overcome such resistance in the case of foreign governments that have been designated as \"State Supporters of Terrorism.\""

These totals likely understate the total number of Forms 8938 that U.S. persons may have filed unnecessarily in tax year 2016; due to data limitations, these totals exclude Forms 8938 without asset information stored in IRS\u2019s databases, including most Forms 8938 filed on paper and Forms 8938 where filers identified that they declared foreign financial assets on other forms besides the Form 8938. There is no clear explanation as to why some U.S. persons may have filed Forms 8938 unnecessarily. However, we identified a number of potential reasons from focus groups and other interviews with stakeholder groups. In focus groups we conducted, participants expressed confusion about IRS\u2019s instructions for completing the Form 8938 and information provided on IRS\u2019s website. In the instructions for completing Form 8938, IRS described the specific types of foreign financial assets that are to be reported on Form 8938, and the asset value thresholds that must be met for required reporting, depending on the location of residence and filing status of the taxpayer. IRS also posted responses to frequently asked questions on meeting FATCA reporting requirements on its website, and established a separate page on its website comparing foreign financial assets that must be reported on Form 8938 and/or FBAR.

We found that OFCCP also faces challenges that may hinder the agency\u2019s oversight of technology companies. Specifically, OFCCP reported facing delays in receiving information from federal contractors, including technology companies, but has not yet evaluated whether its own policies and practices also impede its efforts to hold federal technology contractors responsible for the legal requirements to take affirmative action and not discriminate against protected groups. In addition, OFCCP regulations do not require federal contractors to disaggregate data for the purpose of determining placement goals for hiring, which may hinder contractors\u2019 efforts to implement effective affirmative action programs. OFCCP has not analyzed delays in obtaining information from contractors OFCCP officials told us that they face delays in obtaining complete, accurate, and timely documentation from federal contractors, including technology companies, as part of the compliance review process. They said this limited their access to critical information and hindered OFCCP\u2019s ability to determine whether discrimination had occurred. Officials in the Pacific Region reported that when issues are identified during OFCCP\u2019s initial review that will require additional data, the data requests can be extensive. Consequently, technology contractors are taking longer to submit complete and accurate data that are needed to conduct analyses of the contractor\u2019s workforce. In addition, officials in both the Pacific and Northeast regions reported that companies may not provide raw data as requested, or provide access to employees for OFCCP to interview, which is part of the compliance review process. Using 2015 OFCCP compliance evaluation data, we previously reported that close to 85 percent of contractor establishments across all sectors did not submit an AAP within 30 days of being scheduled for an OFCCP compliance evaluation, as required by OFCCP policy."

We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Description of challenge State and local funding may not be sufficient to support costs associated with transitioning to NG911 equipment and infrastructure. Transitioning from legacy infrastructure to Internet Protocol-based systems presents technical and operational challenges such as interoperability and cybersecurity risks. Federal actions Grant resources: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s (NHTSA) National 911 Program issued on its website a list clarifying which of the fiscal year 2016 emergency-communications grants may be used for NG911 services. Program officials said they developed this list in collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Cost study: NHTSA\u2019s National 911 Program and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), in consultation with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and DHS, plan to issue a study of the range of costs for 911 call centers and service providers to implement NG911 systems and on the nationwide progress of implementing NG911 services. Grant program: NHTSA and NTIA are preparing to jointly administer a $115 million grant program to improve 911 services, including the adoption and operation of NG911 services. NHTSA and NTIA expect to award the grants in 2018. Funding mechanisms: An advisory body tasked by FCC issued a report in 2016 that identified common costs and funding mechanisms for 911 officials to consider. The report also introduced a 911 funding sustainment model designed for use by 911 officials to calculate their financial needs to support a transition to NG911 implementation. Guides on technology standards and procurement practices: In 2017, NHTSA\u2019s National 911 Program issued an annual guide on emergency- communications technology standards that stressed the importance of using open technology standards for NG911 services."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "In addition, a worker is also considered totally disabled if he or she loses both hands, arms, feet, legs, or eyes, or any two of these body systems, such as the loss of one arm and one leg. Total disability benefits under the LHWCA are equal to two-thirds of the covered worker's wage at the time of the injury or illness. Total disability benefits continue until the worker is no longer totally disabled or dies. If a covered worker is able to partially return to work or return to work at a wage level less than his or her wage at the time of injury, then he or she is considered partially disabled. In cases of temporary partial disability, the LHWCA benefit is equal to two-thirds of the difference between the workers' pre-injury wage and his or her current earning capacity or actual earnings. Section 8(c) of the LHWCA provides a schedule of benefits to be paid in cases of permanent partial disability (PPD), such as the loss of a limb. The benefit schedule provides the number of weeks of compensation, at two-thirds of the pre-injury wage, for each type of PPD. For example, the LHWCA schedule provides that a worker who loses an arm is entitled to 312 weeks of compensation. Benefits in cases not listed on the schedule are paid at two-thirds of the difference between the pre-injury wage and current earning capacity for the duration of the disability. Schedule benefits for PPD are paid regardless of the current work status or earnings capacity of the employee. Thus, an employee with a PPD can fully return to work and earn his or her wage in addition to the PPD compensation. A copy of the LHWCA PPD schedule can be found in the Appendix to this report. If a worker has an illness that was caused by his or her covered employment but did not manifest itself until after his or her retirement, then he or she is entitled to disability benefits equal to two-thirds of the NAWW multiplied by the percentage of his or her impairment. The percentage of impairment is determined using the current edition of the American Medical Association's Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (AMA Guides ), or another professionally recognized source if the condition is not listed in the AMA Guides."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "The majority opinion, authored by Justice Thomas, emphasized that \"[t]he dangers associated with content-based regulations of speech are also present in the context of professional speech.\" Even if \"professional speech\" is not coterminous with \"commercial speech,\" this statement does seem to suggest that the Court believes content neutrality principles are relevant in the commercial sphere. In dissent, Justice Breyer, viewing the majority opinion as adopting such a view, argued that the majority's approach, \"if taken literally, could radically change prior law, perhaps placing much securities law or consumer protection law at constitutional risk.\" He pointed out that \"[v]irtually every disclosure law could be considered 'content based,' for virtually every disclosure law requires individuals 'to speak a particular message.'\" In response to Justice Breyer, the NIFLA majority stated that it did not \"question the legality of health and safety warnings long considered permissible, or purely factual and uncontroversial disclosures about commercial products.\" This view echoed the Court's prior statement that \"[p]urely commercial speech is more susceptible to compelled disclosure requirements.\" Following the Court's 2010 decision in Reed , in which the Court articulated a more \"precise test to determine whether speech regulations are content based,\" many lower courts had rejected the idea that content-based requirements affecting only commercial speech should be subject to strict scrutiny, even if they otherwise discriminated based on content under Reed . But because NIFLA appeared to suggest that content neutrality is relevant in the commercial sphere, it seems reasonable to think that lower courts may now be more likely to conclude that strict scrutiny could apply to content-based commercial disclosure requirements. This would be consistent with what some commentators have described as the Court's increasingly heightened scrutiny of restrictions on commercial speech. For now, though, Central Hudson generally continues to govern the analysis of government actions affecting lawful, non-misleading commercial speech, including commercial disclosure requirements that do not qualify for Zauderer review."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "Specifically, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), enacted in 2018, has captured significant attention. Unlike the federal patchwork provisions, neither the method of data collection nor the industry that the business operates in limits the potential application of the CCPA. Instead, the CCPA applies to any company that collects the personal information of Californians, is for-profit, does business in California, and satisfies a basic set of thresholds. Analysts have suggested that these thresholds are low enough that the law could reach a considerable number of even \"relatively small\" businesses with websites accessible in California. The CCPA also does not distinguish between the sources of the data that comes within its scope. Rather, the CCPA regulates all \"personal information,\" which, by the CCPA's definition, covers nearly any information a business would collect from a consumer. The law does not require the presence of any individual identifier, such as a name or address, for data to fall within the meaning of personal information. Rather, the CCPA broadly defines personal information as \"information that identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.\" Following this definition, the CCPA provides some telling illustrations of what constitutes personal information, including any \"electronic network activity [such as] browsing history, search history, and information regarding a consumer's interaction with an Internet Web site, application, or advertisement\" and \"inferences drawn from any of\" this information. The CCPA provides consumers with three main \"rights.\" The first of these is a \" right to know \" the information that businesses have collected or sold about them. This right requires that businesses must, in advance of any collection, \"inform [by mail or electronically] consumers as to the categories of personal information to be collected and the purposes\" to which the information will be put."

In addition, we found that DLA supplements the available Defense Acquisition University training and guidance with a robust level of support, including annual training and subject matter expertise. DLA contracting officers told us that while they found the updated training helpful, they also appreciated the training course internal to their agency, as it addresses the types of procurements they typically handle in their day-to- day work, such as buying spare parts. Further, DLA contracting officers noted that they use the job aid provided through the local training. DHS introduced training courses in 2017 that specifically focus on the requirements and implementation of the Buy American Act, including a mandatory training course for DHS contracting officers. DHS reported that 94 percent of contracting staff had taken the required course as of April 2018. DHS developed these courses in response to the 2017 Executive Order to ensure its staff was familiar with the Buy American Act requirements. Incorporated into these training courses are supplemental on-the-job tools to assist contracting officers when awarding contracts for end products subject to the Buy American Act requirements, such as a flowchart outlining applicable solicitation provisions or contract clauses based upon contract dollar value. Contracting officials generally view the training and tools they received as beneficial. For example, several DHS contracting officials we interviewed said that the agency\u2019s new course provided a helpful review on the topic, while one contracting officer specifically noted that the course materials are useful to new staff, to help them understand the Act\u2019s waivers and exceptions. DHS also revised its acquisition manual in December 2017 to add further detail regarding the Buy American Act requirements. Specifically, DHS updated its acquisition manual to provide contracting officers more explicit FPDS-NG reporting instructions for procurements subject to the Buy American Act, as well as discretion to purchase domestic end products at or below the micro-purchase threshold."

    "documentation": [
      "When the amount of debt forgiveness is greater than the amount of debt outstanding, the Trust Fund would need an additional cash inflow in addition to forgiveness of all outstanding debt. Amounts of debt forgiveness less than zero suggest that no debt forgiveness is required. For options involving forgiving debt (interest or principal), we estimated the average tax per ton of coal that, if implemented in fiscal year 2019, would provide the Trust Fund sufficient revenue to cover its expenditures through fiscal year 2050, assuming the Trust Fund does not receive any advances from Treasury\u2019s general fund after fiscal year 2018. To do so, we first calculated the real discounted present value of Trust Fund expenditures for the period from fiscal year 2019 through fiscal year 2050, again including benefit payments, administrative costs, legacy debt repayments, and repayment of annual borrowing from Treasury\u2019s general fund, minus the real discounted present value of miscellaneous revenues for the same period. Second, we calculated the real discounted present value of coal production for the same period. Third, we calculated the average tax per ton of coal as the first amount divided by the second amount. To assess the sensitivity of each option, we ran each simulation 36 times using four different sets of assumptions about the numbers of future beneficiaries and nine different sets of assumptions about future coal production and prices (see table 6). Doing so provided a range of estimates about the Trust Fund\u2019s future borrowing needs and provided insight on the sensitivity of its overall financial position relative to its various expenditures and revenues. The analysis also provided a range of estimates of the amount of debt forgiveness needed to bring the Trust Fund into balance by fiscal year 2050, assuming various coal tax rates, and the average tax collection per ton needed to do the same, and assuming various amounts of debt forgiveness. From the range of estimates that resulted from our sensitivity analysis, we selected cases with moderate expectations related to future Trust Fund expenditures and revenue."

      "For example, representatives for one tribal government that is providing broadband services said the government will not be able to use a federal grant to build broadband infrastructure in areas of their reservation that lack access, because the Form 477 data overstate actual access on the tribe\u2019s land. As more than three quarters of the tribal governments we spoke to are working to provide broadband services on their lands in some capacity, overstating broadband access on tribal lands could affect the ability of a number of tribes to access federal funding to increase broadband access on their lands. As previously discussed, FCC is considering proposals to modify its Form 477 data collection as part of a 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, but FCC officials told us that the Commission does not have a timeline for issuance of a final rule. While some of FCC\u2019s proposals could help address some of the limitations identified above by, for example, collecting more granular nationwide broadband availability data, FCC has not addressed specifically the collection of more accurate and complete data on broadband access for tribal lands in this proceeding. FCC has identified the need to improve broadband data for tribal lands in particular, and as previously noted, in 2018 Congress directed FCC to develop a report evaluating broadband coverage in certain tribal lands and initiate a proceeding to address the unserved areas identified in the report. FCC officials told us that FCC has not determined how it will address this requirement, but it is currently considering its options, including potentially addressing the requirement as part of its ongoing proposed rulemaking on modernizing the Form 477 data collection. An evaluation of broadband coverage on tribal lands that relies on the current Form 477 data would be subject to the limitations described above, including the overstatement of broadband access on tribal lands. Additionally, FCC has demonstrated that it is possible in some circumstances to collect more granular data when such data collection is targeted to a specific need or area."

Although the Justices were divided on the reasons, the rationale emerging from this case, considered with Williams v. Rhodes , (393 U.S. 20 1968)) is that the Fourteenth Amendment limits state discretion in prescribing the manner of selecting electors and that Congress in enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment may override state practices that violate that Amendment and may substitute standards of its own. Critics of the electoral college system have sought direct election of the President and Vice President without success for more than two centuries. The NPV initiative represents a novel effort to achieve this goal by use of an interstate compact that would circumvent the stringent requirements necessary for the proposal and ratification of constitutional amendments. Since its inception in 2006, NPV has achieved a degree of success: 14 states and the District of Columbia, controlling a total of 189 electoral votes, have joined the compact since 2008. Progress has arguably been sporadic, however, notwithstanding active campaigning by National Popular Vote Inc. Over the course of more than a decade, NPV has heretofore failed to develop a sustained momentum toward its stated goal of states controlling 270 electoral votes. The action of three states in joining NPV to date in 2019 marks the most activity in a single year since 2008; it remains to be seen whether this trend will continue. To date, certain Democratic-leaning states have joined the compact. The arguable lack of support in Republican-controlled state legislatures raises questions about further accessions to the compact in the immediate future, particularly given the fact that the GOP controlled both legislative chambers in 30 states following the 2018 elections. To date, while the NPV initiative has generated interest among supporters of direct popular election of the President, it does not appear to have gained widespread awareness among the public at large."

      "D) Preventing businesses from using their advertising to promote viewpoints that may be unpopular or controversial."

    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "The seminal Supreme Court case establishing that commercial speech is protected by the First Amendment, Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council , tied commercial speech's value to its ability to inform consumers. Critically, the Court said that governments could continue to ban false or misleading commercial speech , noting in another case that \"the public and private benefits from commercial speech derive from confidence in its accuracy and reliability.\" It was against this background that the Court in Zauderer concluded that the provision requiring the disclosure of factual information about contingent fee arrangements did not involve First Amendment interests \"of the same order as those\" involved in other cases involving the compulsion of noncommercial speech. Accordingly, the state acted reasonably by prescribing that attorneys had to include in their advertising \"purely factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which [their] services [would] be available.\" The first element for a commercial disclosure requirement to be eligible for Zauderer review is that the government regulation must require the disclosure of \"factual and uncontroversial\" information. The two parts of Zauderer's initial requirement are often evaluated as one, although courts have sometimes pointed out that \"factual\" and \"uncontroversial,\" logically, connote two different things. Viewing the two words together, some have characterized the \"factual and uncontroversial\" requirement as distinguishing regulations that compel the disclosure of facts from those that compel individuals to state opinions or ideologies. As discussed, the Supreme Court has said that the value of commercial speech largely lies in its ability to inform consumers. And in Zauderer , the Court emphasized that because protection for commercial speech is justified by its informational value, the attorney challenging the disclosure requirement had a \"minimal\" First Amendment interest \"in not providing any particular factual information in his advertising.\""

Most officials overseas had received some guidance concerning the restrictions on promoting tobacco. Officials in 21 of the 24 offices overseas we interviewed had received written or verbal guidance concerning the restrictions on promoting tobacco at some point in their career. For example, officials in 15 offices mentioned receiving the State-issued interagency guidance cable when we asked them what type of tobacco-related guidance they had received. In addition, officials in four of the eight Commerce offices recalled receiving agency-specific guidance. Some officials said that their supervisors had informed them they are not allowed to promote tobacco exports. Some officials did not recall receiving the interagency guidance cable, which agency officials said serves as the primary source of guidance for implementing the restrictions, and some were not aware that State periodically issues the cable."

      "President Duque, along with his vice president, Marta Luc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, who initially ran as the Conservative Party candidate in the first round, recommended that drug policy shift back to a stricter counterdrug approach rather than a model endorsed in the peace accord, which focuses on voluntary eradication and economic support to peasant farmers to transition away from illicit drug crops. Duque campaigned on returning to spraying coca crops with the herbicide glyphosate. This would reverse Colombia's decision in mid-2015 to end aerial spraying, which had been a central\u2014albeit controversial\u2014feature of U.S.-Colombian counter-drug cooperation for two decades. Colombians' concerns with corruption became particularly acute during the 2018 elections, as major scandals were revealed. Similar to many countries in the region, government officials, including Santos during his 2014 campaign for reelection and the opposition candidate during that campaign were accused of taking payoffs (bribes) from the Odebrecht firm, the Brazilian construction company that became embroiled in a region-wide corruption scandal. In December 2018, presidential runner up Gustavo Petro was accused of taking political contributions from Odebrecht in a video released by a CD senator, indicating that both the left and the right of the Colombian political spectrum has been tainted by corruption allegations. In June 2017, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration arrested Colombia's top anti-corruption official, Gustavo Moreno. In mid-September 2017, the former chief justice of Colombia's Supreme Court was arrested for his alleged role in a corruption scandal that involved other justices accused of taking bribes from Colombian congressmen, some with ties to illegal paramilitary groups. The series of corruption charges made against members of Colombia's judicial branch, politicians, and other officials made the issue a prominent one in Colombian politics and was the focus of a left-centrist candidate's campaign in the presidential contest."

    "documentation": [
      "It is our understanding that the GAO's independent opinion is generally given considerable weight by the agencies. Is this also the GAO's understanding of its role? In response, GAO's general counsel, Robert Murphy, stated that the CRA does not provide any identification of who is to decide what a rule is, unlike the issue of whether a rule is a major rule or not, which, as [OIRA Administrator] Ms. Katzen pointed out, has been assigned to her. So in that sense, I cannot say that GAO has a special role under the statute for making that determination. The decision, the opinion, that we issued last week on the question [of whether the Tongass Land Management Plan was a rule under the CRA] was done in our role as adviser to the Congress in response to the request of three chairmen of congressional committees. Thus, GAO acknowledged that its opinion was provided not pursuant to any specific provision of the statute, but in a more general, advisory capacity. In the years following, Members continued to request GAO opinions advising Congress on the matter of whether an agency action should have been submitted. Although GAO has issued 21 opinions on the applicability of the CRA since 1996, Congress's response to those opinions has varied over time. Initially, the GAO opinions finding that the agency actions in question were rules under the CRA did not lead to the introduction of joint resolutions of disapproval\u2014Members appear not to have introduced any joint resolutions of disapproval following a GAO opinion until 2008. In 2008, GAO issued an opinion stating that a letter from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to state health officials concerning the State Children's Health Insurance Program was a rule for the purposes of the CRA; in response, Senator John D. Rockefeller introduced S.J.Res. 44 to disapprove the guidance provided in the letter. According to a press release from the Committee on Finance at the time, however, the committee did not take further action on the resolution of disapproval because it had missed the window during which the action would have been required to be taken under the CRA to use its expedited procedures."

    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "Duties and structures of state and local election systems may affect how quickly federal funding is claimed and used and how well the uses to which it is put serve federal objectives. For example, HAVA has authorized payments to states to meet its requirements (52 U.S.C. \u00a721007). It has directed those payments to be disbursed to states (52 U.S.C. \u00a721001(a)) and charged chief state election officials with overseeing decisions about how to spend them (52 U.S.C. \u00a721005(a)). State election officials run federal elections in some states, but those states are the exception. As noted in \" Implementation \" and \" Funding ,\" most states assign election administration implementation and funding duties to local officials. That means that the officials who receive HAVA funding and are charged with overseeing decisions about how to use it often differ from the officials who conduct and pay for the activities and resources it is intended to fund. That has had at least two reported consequences. First, in some cases, it has reportedly delayed access to or use of some HAVA funds. Directing HAVA funding to states introduces opportunities for state-level delays, such as decisions by state officials to wait to claim the funds or requirements in state law to obtain approval to do so. Second, some local officials have stated the view that their states' shares of HAVA funding were not put to what they considered the areas of greatest need. Box 7 provides examples of such consequences as described by state and local officials in Nevada, Minnesota, and Virginia. Congress can require or facilitate information sharing with states and localities by federal agencies. As with funding, the effectiveness of federal information sharing may depend in part on how timely it is. How quickly federal agencies share information with the appropriate state and local officials may be affected by the distribution of election administration duties at the state and federal levels. Box 8 provides an example of such an effect reported by NASS."

      "From fiscal years 2011 through 2017, state and local jurisdictions contributed on average about $340 million annually to WMATA, generally for capital purposes. The annual capital contributions from the jurisdictions are expected to more than double as a result of the recent legislation enacted by the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia in 2018. In addition, WMATA officials told us that it will have the ability to further leverage this dedicated funding and issue debt to finance its capital projects. WMATA has several steps in its capital planning process. These include developing the following: Capital Needs Inventory. WMATA periodically identifies its capital investment needs in this inventory. WMATA issued a Capital Needs Inventory in February 2010 and another in November 2016, each covering a 10-year period. According to WMATA, Capital Needs Inventories help inform the annual capital budget and capital improvement program. Annual Capital Budget. Each year, WMATA prepares an annual capital budget, which identifies projects WMATA plans to undertake in the next fiscal year. WMATA\u2019s fiscal year 2019 annual capital budget was approved by the board of directors at $1.3 billion. Six-Year Capital Improvement Program. Within WMATA\u2019s annual capital budget, WMATA includes a Six-Year Capital Improvement Program identifying capital projects WMATA plans to implement over a 6-year period. WMATA\u2019s most recent Six-Year Capital Improvement Program (covering the fiscal year 2019\u20142024 period) was approved by the board of directors at $8.5 billion.

The fiscal year 2020 Capital Budget is scheduled to be adopted and implemented by June 30, 2019. Among other things, the goals and objectives of this new capital planning process are to construct an objective, data-driven, and risk-based approach to estimate major rehabilitation and capital asset replacement needs; build a capital investment prioritization methodology aligned with WMATA\u2019s strategic goals and grounded in asset inventory and condition assessments; and develop a process that will support the construction and ongoing stewardship of its Transit Asset Management Plan."

      "This report provides background information and potential oversight issues for Congress on the Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier program. The Navy's proposed FY2019 budget requests a total of $2,347 million (i.e., about $2.3 billion) in procurement funding for the CVN-78 program. Congress's decisions on the CVN-78 program could substantially affect Navy capabilities and funding requirements and the shipbuilding industrial base. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission also proposed to not fund the mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul (called a Refueling Complex Overhaul, or RCOH) for the aircraft carrier CVN-75 ( Harry S. Truman ), and to instead retire the ship around FY2024 and also deactivate one of the Navy's carrier air wings at about the same time. On April 30, 2019, however, the Administration announced that it was effectively withdrawing this proposal from the Navy's FY2020 budget submission. The Administration now supports funding the CVN-75 RCOH and keeping CVN-75 (and by implication its associated air wing) in service past FY2024. For additional discussion of this withdrawn budget proposal, see Appendix A . For an overview of the strategic and budgetary context in which the CVN-78 class program and other Navy shipbuilding programs may be considered, see CRS Report RL32665, Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans: Background and Issues for Congress , by Ronald O'Rourke. The Navy's current aircraft carrier force consists of 11 nuclear-powered ships, including 10 Nimitz-class ships (CVNs 68 through 77) that entered service between 1975 and 2009, and one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class ship that was commissioned into service on July 22, 2017. 10 U.S.C. 8062(b) requires the Navy to maintain a force of not less than 11 operational aircraft carriers.

Federal expenditures for this program were approximately $8.3 million in FY2017. States receive formula grants through the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, under which state-selected schools receive funds to purchase and distribute fresh fruit and vegetable snacks to all children in attendance (regardless of family income). Money is distributed by a formula under which about half the funding is distributed equally to each state and the remainder is allocated by state population. States select participating schools (with an emphasis on those with a higher proportion of low-income children) and set annual per-student grant amounts (between $50 and $75). Funding is set by law at $150 million for school year 2011-2012 and inflation-indexed for every year after. In FY2017, states used approximately $184 million in FFVP funds. FFVP is funded by a mandatory transfer of funds from USDA's Section 32 program\u2014a permanent appropriation of 30% of the previous year's customs receipts. This transfer is required by FFVP's authorizing laws (Section 19 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and Section 4304 of P.L. 110-246 ). Up until FY2018's law, annual appropriations laws delayed a portion of the funds to the next fiscal year. After a pilot period, the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-265 ) permanently authorized and funded FFVP for a limited number of states and Indian reservations.

      "A local CPS official we interviewed stated that drug exposure, in and of itself, is not necessarily a safety risk, and CPS should not intervene with families who are not at risk for child abuse or neglect. Instead, hospitals or treatment providers should intervene and refer families who do not meet criteria for CPS involvement, but could benefit from additional supports, to voluntary services. Kentucky public health officials told us that the period after a woman gives birth is a critical time for families as mothers may be stressed, sleep-deprived, exhausted, and may have other children in the home. This period may be especially challenging for mothers with substance use disorders, if adequate supports are not in place. According to officials women are typically covered for substance use treatment during pregnancy; however, this coverage ends roughly 60 days after the baby is born. In written responses to our survey, some states reported that they would rely on other agencies to develop plans of safe care. Similarly, in order to manage limited CPS resources, officials from two of the three states that we visited said they are considering having hospitals or other agencies assume responsibility for developing plans of safe care when there is no evidence of abuse or neglect and there appears to be minimal risk to the safety and well-being of the infant. Kentucky officials told us that they envision that CPS will be responsible for developing a plan of safe care for notifications that are accepted for investigation, while hospitals, or another agency, will be responsible for developing plans of safe care for referrals that are screened out by CPS. According to CPS state officials, the plan of safe care for the infant and the family can be part of the discharge plan prior to the family leaving the hospital. However, officials reported that obtaining cooperation from other agencies may be difficult. Some state officials reported being concerned that other agencies may not feel obligated to develop these plans, in part, because CAPTA provides funding to child welfare, and other agencies may therefore believe that child welfare should be responsible for developing the plan of safe care."

DOD has previously used CDC\u2019s sexual violence prevention framework to guide its sexual assault prevention strategy. In the absence of more comprehensive policies on sexual harassment that fully include principles in the CDC framework for sexual violence prevention, DOD may be missing opportunities to address and potentially reduce incidents of sexual harassment in the military population based on risk and protective factors and effective, tested strategies. Specifically, DOD may be missing the opportunity to identify risk factors, which would help to recognize situations where individuals and populations may be at a higher risk of sexual harassment perpetration or victimization; identify protective factors to lower the risk of sexual harassment; develop mechanisms to address sexual harassment across risk domains\u2014at the individual, relationship, community, and society levels; and develop tertiary strategies, or long-term responses after sexual violence has occurred to address the lasting consequences of violence and sex- offender treatment interventions.

Section 579 mandated that DOD, among other things, develop a comprehensive sexual harassment policy that includes the following elements: (1) prevention training for members of the armed forces; (2) mechanisms for reporting sexual harassment, including mechanisms for anonymous reporting; and (3) mechanisms for resolving sexual harassment that include the prosecution of perpetrators."

      "C) Refine the Soyuz launch schedule to maximize the remaining access time before commercial crew flights begin, while simultaneously exploring alternative options.",
      "D) Focus on developing new launch vehicles and spacecraft independent of international partnerships, as this will ensure long-term U.S. autonomy in space."

      "Senior NASA officials told us that sustaining a U.S. presence on the ISS is essential to maintain and operate integral systems, without which the ISS cannot function. Given the importance of maintaining a U.S. presence on the ISS, NASA officials have stated they are working on options to address the potential gap in access. However, officials told us that planning for contingencies is difficult given the extensive international negotiations required for some options. Obtaining additional Soyuz seats seems unlikely, as the process for manufacturing the spacecraft and contracting for those seats typically takes 3 years\u2014meaning additional seats would not be available before 2021. As a result, according to NASA\u2019s Associate Administrator for Human Exploration and Operations, the options NASA is considering include: Refine the remaining Soyuz launch schedule to allow for a return in January 2020, as opposed to November 2019. This would provide 2 additional months of access to the ISS before the commercial crew flights need to start. Use the crewed flight tests as operational flights to transport U.S. astronauts to and from the ISS. In March 2018, NASA modified Boeing\u2019s contract to allow NASA to add a third crew member and extend the length of the flight test, if NASA chooses to do so. This would have limited usefulness, however, in filling a potential gap in access to the ISS if the schedule for Boeing\u2019s crewed flight test slips past the return date for the last Soyuz flight and SpaceX also continues to experience delays. NASA\u2019s Associate Administrator for Human Exploration and Operations stated that he is \u201cbrainstorming\u201d other options to ensure access to the ISS but does not have a formal plan. While options are not unlimited and decisions have to be made within the context of the current geopolitical environment, Congress stated in the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 that it is U.S. policy to possess the capability for human access to space on a continuous basis. In 2010, Congress further stated that one of the key objectives of the United States\u2019 human spaceflight policy is to sustain the capability for long-duration presence in low-Earth orbit through full utilization of the ISS."

For one of the agreements, USDA had no documentation of the monitoring activities for that agreement. For its other two agreements, USDA did not have full documentation of the required monitoring activities. USDA officials did not explain why they did not have full documentation.

USAID had partial documentation of those 2 monitoring activities. For example, USAID provided us with some, but not all, records such as financial reports required by the terms of the monitoring activities in the agreements. According to USAID officials, the agencies\u2019 lack of complete monitoring documentation was in part due to agency officials not following some of their agency\u2019s requirements for managing agreement documents, such as placing all documents in a shared document management system. For example, for one of the agreements we reviewed, USAID officials stated that they stored some agreement documentation electronically\u2014such as modifications, correspondence with the agreement recipient, and quarterly financial reports\u2014but primarily maintained paper files. USAID officials told us they use the monitoring documents of these agreements, such as financial and progress reports, to inform future budgetary and programmatic decisions.

      "That said, WTO agreements and decisions of panels are not self-executing and cannot directly modify U.S. law. If a case is brought against the United States and the panel renders an adverse decision, the United States would be expected to remove the offending measure within a reasonable period of time or face the possibility of either paying compensation to the complaining member or becoming subject to sanctions, often in the form of higher tariffs on imports of certain U.S. products. As of the beginning of 2019, the WTO has initiated nearly 580 disputes on behalf of its members and issued more than 350 rulings, with 2018 marking its most active year to date. Nearly two-thirds of WTO members have participated in the dispute settlement system. Not all complaints result in formal panel proceedings; about half were resolved during consultations. The complainants usually win their cases, in large part because they initiate disputes that they have a high chance of winning. In the words of WTO Director-General (DG) Roberto Azev\u00eado, the widespread use of the DS system is evidence it \"enjoys tremendous confidence among the membership, who value it as a fair, effective, efficient mechanism to solve trade problems.\" The United States is an active user of the DS system. Among WTO members, the United States has been a complainant in the most dispute cases since the system was established in 1995, initiating 123 disputes, followed by the EU with 100 disputes. The two largest targets of complaints initiated by the United States are China and the EU, which, combined, account for more than one-third ( Figure 6 ). The latest summary by USTR reports that among WTO disputes through 2015 the United States largely prevailed on \"core issues\" in 46 of its complaints and lost in 4. Since the report was released, additional cases have been ruled in favor of the United States, including disputes over India's solar energy policies and Indonesia's import licensing requirements. The majority of disputes initiated by the United States between 2016 and early 2019 remain in the consultation or panel stages and have not been decided."

      "Such challenges may include the need for increased levels of coordination among numerous jurisdictions with potentially disparate organizational structures, levels of funding, and priorities. An official also noted that there are governance challenges related to connecting states and evolving relationships between 911 authorities and service providers. Informing decision makers: One of the challenges identified by officials in two states is differing levels of experience and understanding by state and local officials as to what NG911 priorities should be for timely implementation. To help with this understanding, the federal government is making efforts to educate state and local authorities on how to facilitate policymaker understanding as well as provide regular updates to stakeholders on recent NG911 developments. We discuss some of these efforts later in this report. While state and local entities have the primary responsibility for implementing NG911 technology and services, federal agencies are taking actions to assist state and local 911 entities to address NG911 implementation challenges. Actions taken include developing resources, offering technical assistance, and convening stakeholders. More specifically, we identified selected activities that were taken by NHTSA, NTIA, FCC, and DHS that address some of the funding, technology, and governance challenges raised by state and local 911 stakeholders, for example: Cost study: NHTSA\u2019s National 911 Program and NTIA, in consultation with FCC and DHS, plan to issue a study of the range of costs for 911 call centers and service providers to implement NG911 systems. According to NHTSA officials, the cost study will present a nationwide view, rather than a state-by-state view, on the progress of NG911 implementation and its associated costs. Grant program: NHTSA and NTIA are preparing to jointly administer a $115 million grant program to improve 911 services, including the adoption and operation of NG911 services. In September 2017, NHTSA and NTIA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking outlining implementing regulations for the grant program."

      "As discussed, Central Hudson requires that the government prove that its interest is \"substantial,\" and that the regulation \"directly advances\" that interest and is \"not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.\" Government regulations are more likely to fail this more rigorous standard than the Zauderer reasonableness standard, often because a court believes there is some less restrictive means available for the government to achieve its goals. Courts will require more \"evidence of a measure's effectiveness\" under Central Hudson , as compared to Zauderer . However, Central Hudson is more forgiving than strict scrutiny, and courts do uphold government actions infringing on commercial speech under Central Hudson . For example, in Spirit Airlines v. Department of Transportation , the D.C. Circuit concluded that a federal regulation governing the way that airlines must display flight prices \"satisfie[d] . . . the Central Hudson test.\" In the court's view, \"[t]he government interest\u2014ensuring the accuracy of commercial information in the marketplace\u2014[was] clearly and directly advanced by a regulation requiring that the total, final price be the most prominent\" price displayed. And the regulation was \"reasonably tailored to accomplish that end\" because the rule \"simply regulate[d] the manner of disclosure.\" Government actions are unlikely to be upheld if a court applies strict scrutiny. Nonetheless, some scholars have argued that many disclosure requirements might survive strict scrutiny, and the Supreme Court has, in rare instances, said that the government may \"directly regulate speech to address extraordinary problems, where its regulations are appropriately tailored to resolve those problems without imposing an unnecessarily great restriction on speech.\" It is possible that a court could hold that the government has a compelling interest in protecting consumers, for example, and that particular disclosures are narrowly tailored to meet that interest. The Supreme Court has long emphasized that the government can regulate commercial activity \"deemed harmful to the public.\""

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "In November 2014, the United States and the People\u2019s Republic of China reciprocally increased the validity periods of multiple-entry tourist and business visitor visas issued to each other\u2019s citizens for up to 10 years. The change in policy was intended to support improved trade, investment, and business by facilitating travel between the two countries. According to State officials, extending validity periods can create an initial increase in demand for such visas, followed by a period of stabilization or even decline as NIV holders would be required to apply for renewal less frequently. According to State officials, in early fiscal year 2015, the increase in the validity period to 10 years for such visas created a spike in Chinese demand in fiscal year 2015, and by fiscal year 2016, the initial demand for these visas had been met and Chinese economic growth was simultaneously slowing, resulting in fewer adjudications for such visas in fiscal year 2017. State data for this time period indicate that the number of adjudications for tourist and business visitor visas for Chinese nationals increased from 1.58 million in fiscal year 2014 to 2.54 million in fiscal year 2015, followed by a decline to 2.34 million in fiscal year 2016 and 1.76 million in fiscal year 2017. Student and Exchange Visitors. Similar to tourist and business visitors, State officials partly attributed the overall changes in student and exchange visitor visa adjudications to the extension of the validity period of such visas for Chinese nationals, which represented the largest single country of nationality for student and exchange visitor visas in fiscal year 2017 (19 percent). In November 2014, the United States extended the validity period of the F visa for academic students from 1 year to 5 years. State officials noted that similar to tourist and business visitor visas, there was an initial surge in Chinese F-visa applicants due to the new 5-year F-visa validity period that began in fiscal year 2015, but the number dropped subsequently because Chinese students with such 5-year visas no longer needed to apply as frequently for F visas."

    "correct_answer": "A)",
    "documentation": [
      "The Select Committee also found that, for data-gathering purposes, the executive branch defined small businesses in relative, as opposed to absolute, terms within specific industries. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics \"defined small business in terms of an average for each industry based on the volume of employment or sales. All firms which fall below this average are deemed to be small.\" The U.S. Census Bureau also used different criteria for different industries. For example, manufacturing firms were classified as small if they had fewer than 100 employees, wholesalers were considered small if they had annual sales below $200,000, and retailers were considered small if they had annual sales below $50,000. According the Census Bureau, in 1952, small businesses accounted for \"roughly 92 percent of all business establishments, 45 percent of all employees, and 34 percent of all dollar value of all sales.\" The Select Committee also noted that in 1951, the National Production Authority's Office of Small Business proposed defining all manufacturing firms with fewer than 50 employees as small and any with more than 2,500 employees as large. Manufacturers employing between these numbers of employees would be considered large or small depending on the general structure of the industry to which they belonged. The larger the percentage of total output produced by large firms, the larger the number of employees a firm could have to be considered small. Using this definition, most manufacturing firms with fewer than 50 employees would be classified as small, but others, such as an aircraft manufacturer, could have as many as 2,500 employees and still be considered small. For procurement purposes, the Select Committee found that executive branch agencies defined small businesses in absolute, as opposed to relative, terms, using 500 employees as the dividing line between large and small firms. Federal agencies defended the so-called 500 employee rule on the grounds that it \"had the advantage of easy administration\" across federal agencies."

And without following its SOP for monitoring the corrective actions, APHIS cannot ensure that the highest-priority actions are completed. APHIS has taken important steps to prepare for an FMD outbreak and to mitigate challenges it may face in responding to one. For example, the agency has developed an extensive collection of strategy and guidance documents, held FMD preparedness exercises to practice response activities, and identified dozens of corrective actions and completed some of these actions. However, APHIS has not yet completed other corrective actions, including actions that have been identified multiple times, such as developing a process for prioritizing and allocating the limited supply of FMD vaccine. APHIS has an SOP for prioritizing and monitoring corrective actions. By following this SOP for avian influenza preparedness, the agency succeeded in prioritizing more than 300 corrective actions and tracking over 200 corrective actions to completion, including nearly all high-priority actions. In contrast, for FMD preparedness, APHIS has not consistently prioritized or monitored the corrective actions it has identified. Without following its SOP to prioritize and monitor corrective actions for FMD preparedness, APHIS cannot ensure that it is allocating its limited resources to the most beneficial actions to prepare for a possible FMD outbreak.

The Port of Singapore plans to source imported LNG at the adjacent Jurong Island LNG terminal, loading it into the bunkering vessels for ship-to-ship fueling of vessels in port. Singapore also has signed a memorandum of understanding with 10 other partners\u2014including a Japanese Ministry and the Chinese Port of Ningbo-Zhoushan\u2014to create a focus group aimed at promoting the adoption of LNG bunkering at ports around the world. In Japan, one consortium is implementing plans to begin vessel-to-vessel LNG bunkering at the Port of Keihin in Tokyo Bay by 2020. Japan's NYK line, a large ship owner, recently announced that it had reached an agreement with three Japanese utilities to add LNG bunkering to ports in Western Japan. Asian countries, together with Australia and the United Arab Emirates, currently have around 10 coastal ports offering LNG bunkering, with another 15 projects in development. Some LNG bunkering operations in Europe and Asia are associated with existing LNG marine terminals, which already have LNG storage and port infrastructure in place.

      "Of the home purchase mortgages insured by FHA in FY2018, about 83% were made to first-time homebuyers. Over a third of all mortgages (both for home purchases and refinances) insured by FHA in FY2018 were made to minority borrowers. As shown in Table 5 , at the end of FY2018 FHA was insuring a total of over 8 million single-family loans that together had an outstanding balance of nearly $1.2 trillion. Since it was first established in 1934, FHA has insured a total of over 47.5 million home\u00a0loans. FHA's share of the mortgage market is the amount of mortgages that are insured by FHA compared to the total amount of mortgages originated or outstanding in a given time period. FHA's market share can be measured in a number of different ways. Therefore, when evaluating FHA's market share, it is important to recognize which of several different figures is being reported. First, FHA's share of the mortgage market can be computed as the number of FHA-insured mortgages divided by the total number of mortgages, or as the dollar volume of FHA-insured mortgages divided by the total dollar volume of mortgages. Furthermore, FHA's market share is sometimes reported as a share of all mortgages , and sometimes only as a share of home purchase mortgages (as opposed to both mortgages made to purchase a home and mortgages made to refinance an existing mortgage). A market share figure can be reported as a share of all mortgages originated within a specific time period , such as a given year, or as a share of all mortgages outstanding at a point in time , regardless of when they were originated. Finally, FHA's market share is sometimes also reported as a share of the total number of mortgages that have some kind of mortgage insurance (including mortgages with private mortgage insurance and mortgages insured by another government agency) rather than as a share of all mortgages regardless of whether or not they have mortgage insurance. FHA's market share tends to fluctuate in response to economic conditions and other factors."

      "Moreover, FERC officials noted that the information needed to develop third party safety studies, such as the dam design drawings and engineering studies, are property of the licensee, rather than FERC. In addition, this information may not be readily available to third parties or the public if FERC designates it as critical energy infrastructure information, which would preclude its release to the general public. FERC staff we interviewed stated that there have been no instances where the Commission denied a new license to a licensee as a result of its safety review during relicensing. FERC staff stated that given the frequency of other inspections, including the FERC staff inspections, and independent consultant inspections, it is unlikely staff would find a previously unknown major safety issue during relicensing. FERC staff told us that rather than deny a license for safety deficiencies, FERC will keep a dam owner under the terms of a FERC license to better ensure the licensee remedies existing safety deficiencies. Specifically, FERC staff noted that under a license, FERC can ensure dam safety by (1) closely monitoring the deficiency\u2019s remediation progress through its inspection program, (2) adding license terms in the new license tailored to the specific safety deficiency, and (3), as necessary, pursuing compliance and enforcement actions, such as civil penalties or stop work orders, to enforce the terms and conditions of the license. For example, prior to and during the relicensing of a FERC-licensed project in Wisconsin in 2014, FERC\u2019s review identified that the spillway capacity was inadequate. While the project was relicensed in 2017 without changes to the spillway, FERC officials stated that they have been overseeing the plans and studies of the remediation of the spillway through their ongoing inspection program. However, if an imminent safety threat is identified during the relicensing review, FERC officials stated that they will order that the licensee take actions to remedy the issue immediately."

      "Weapon systems are sustained under various arrangements that may include contractors, DOD organic facilities, or some combination of the two. For example, the Air Force Sustainment Center provides depot maintenance through its Air Logistics Complexes for weapon systems. Naval Air Systems Command is responsible for the Navy Fleet Readiness Centers, which provide depot-level maintenance for Navy and Marine Corps fixed-wing aircraft. Additionally, the Air Force Sustainment Center and the Navy Supply Systems Command, as well as the Defense Logistics Agency, manage inventories of repair parts, and individual weapon systems programs are typically supported by a complex supplier network that includes a prime contractor, subcontractors, and various tiers of parts suppliers. On the other hand, sustainment responsibilities\u2014in their entirety or particular elements\u2014may be contracted out as part of a public-private partnership or a performance-based logistics agreement, such as with the F-22 Raptor. The Air Force and Navy monitor the readiness status of selected fixed- wing aircraft through numerous performance metrics. Specifically, the Air Force measures how well a fleet is performing by calculating the availability of the fleets\u2019 aircraft, which is the number of aircraft that are available for flight operations. The Navy measures its aircraft availability through two metrics: (1) Ready-Basic-Aircraft (RBA)\u2014the number of aircraft that are able to safely fly\u2014and (2) Ready-for-Tasking (RFT)\u2014the number of aircraft that are able to conduct specific missions. Both the Air Force and Navy have established goals associated with aircraft availability. In addition to measuring the availability of the aircraft against the associated goals, the Air Force and Navy track the reasons for aircraft not being available or able to conduct missions. Specifically, the Air Force and Navy track the following: Aircraft in depot: Aircraft unavailable to conduct missions because of scheduled or unscheduled depot maintenance or modification."

For the Department of State and USAID, as well as the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard, FY2019 OCO levels have not yet been determined. They remain at prorated FY2018 levels because of continuing resolutions (CR) to fund certain agencies through December 21, 2018. The FY2019 House and Senate SFOPS bills ( H.R. 6385 and S. 3108 , 115 th Congress) would have appropriated approximately $8 billion in OCO-designated funding for various priorities. The House committee-reported version of the Homeland Security appropriations bill ( H.R. 6776 , 115 th Congress) would not have appropriated any OCO/GWOT funding for the Coast Guard, while the Senate committee-reported version of the bill ( S. 3109 , 115 th Congress) would have appropriated $165 million for OCO/GWOT funding for the Coast Guard. Any decision by the 116 th Congress to change discretionary defense and nondefense spending limits that remain in effect for FY2020 and FY2021 under the Budget Control Act (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ) could impact future OCO funding levels. Lawmakers may consider the following questions: Will Congress keep the BCA as is and rely on OCO funding that is not subject to the caps to meet agency requirements? Will Congress repeal the BCA and use less OCO funding? Will Congress amend the BCA limits for future years and continue to use OCO funding, as it has in the past? Will Congress significantly reduce DOD and international affairs funding to stay within the BCA caps and not use OCO funding?"

Finally, Figure A-1 depicts the use of the suspension procedure from the 110 th through the 114 th Congresses (2007-2016). The suspension of the rules procedure is established by clause 1 of House Rule XV. Bills, resolutions, House amendments to Senate bills, amendments to the Constitution, conference reports, and other types of business may be considered under suspension, even those \"that would otherwise be subject to a point of order \u2026 [or have] not been reported or referred to any calendar or previously introduced.\" Suspension motions are in order on designated days. As Rule XV states, \"the Speaker may not entertain a motion that the House suspend the rules except on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays and during the last six days of a session of Congress.\" Suspension measures, however, may be considered on other days by unanimous consent or under the terms of a special order of business (special rule) reported by the Committee on Rules and agreed to by the House. A motion to suspend the rules is a compound motion to suspend the House rules and pass a bill or agree to a resolution. When considering such a motion, the House is voting on the two questions simultaneously. Once recognized, the Member making the motion will say, \"Mr. [or Madam] Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass___.\" The House rules that are suspended under this procedure include those that \"would impede an immediate vote on passage of a measure \u2026 such as ordering the previous question, third reading, recommittal, or division of the question.\" A measure considered under the suspension procedure is not subject to floor amendment. The motion to suspend and pass the measure, though, may provide for passage of the measure in an amended form. That is, the text to be approved may be presented in a form altered by committee amendments or by informal negotiations. Suspension measures that are passed with changes incorporated into the text are passed \"as amended.\""

This is due in part to uncertainty about potential employer responses, such as increasing salaries above the new threshold to maintain exemption for EAP employees. DOL estimates, with caveats, that approximately 4.9 million workers would be affected by the proposed rule. DOL identifies two groups in particular that would be affected\u2014newly covered workers and workers with strengthened protections. Specifically, DOL estimates the following: In the first year under the provisions of the 2019 proposed rule, about 1.3 million EAP employees would become newly entitled to overtime pay due to the increase in the salary threshold: about 1.1 million employees in this group meet the duties test for the EAP exemption but earn between the current standard salary threshold ($455 per week) and the proposed threshold ($679 per week); and an additional 201,000 employees in this group meet the HCE duties test for exemption, but not the standard test, and earn at least the current HCE salary threshold ($100,000 per year) but less than the proposed threshold ($147,414 per year). An additional 3.6 million workers would receive \"strengthened\" overtime protections, including the following: An additional 2.0 million white collar workers who are paid on a salary basis and earn between the current salary threshold of $455 per week and the proposed threshold of $679 per week but do not meet the EAP duties test (i.e., they perform nonexempt work but might be misclassified) would gain overtime protections because their exemption status would not depend on the duties test. In other words, this group of workers would gain overtime coverage because the higher salary threshold would create a clearer line exemption test and reduce misclassification for exemption purposes. About 1.6 million salaried workers in blue collar occupations whose overtime coverage would have been clearer with the higher salary threshold."

The $2.03 billion total in the bill for EPA water infrastructure programs and projects was $386 million more than was requested by the President, but $301 million less than Congress appropriated for FY2005. Further, the funding amounts specified in P.L. 109-54 were reduced slightly. First, a provision of P.L. 109-54 , Section 439, mandated an across-the-board rescission of 0.476% for any discretionary appropriation in that bill. Second, in December 2005 Congress enacted P.L. 109-148 , the FY2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, and Section 3801 of that bill mandated a 1% across-the-board rescission for discretionary accounts in any FY2006 appropriation act (except for discretionary authority of the Department of Veterans Affairs). As a result of these two rescissions, the final levels for the STAG account were $887 million for clean water SRF grants; $838 million for drinking water SRF grants; $281 million for 259 earmarked grants in listed communities, Alaska Native Villages, and along the U.S.-Mexico border; and $1.11 billion for categorical state grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. FY2006 EPA water infrastructure programs and projects thus total $2.0 billion. On October 28, President Bush requested that Congress rescind $2.3 billion from 55 \"lower-priority federal programs and excess funds,\" including $166 million from clean water SRF monies. In the end, Congress did not endorse the specific request to reduce clean water SRF appropriations. The two rescissions resulting from P.L. 109-54 and P.L. 109-148 totaled a $13.2 million reduction from the $900 million specified in the EPA appropriations act. President Bush presented the Administration's FY2007 budget request in February 2006, asking Congress to appropriate $1.570 billion for EPA's water infrastructure programs. The FY2007 request sought $687.6 million for clean water SRF grants, $841.5 million for drinking water SRF grants, and $40.6 million for special projects in Alaska Native Villages, Puerto Rico, and along the U.S.-Mexico border."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "Collectively, LNG supply from these new liquefaction projects could exceed projections of demand, which would put downward pressure on LNG prices. While increases in the global supply of LNG do not necessarily translate directly into an increase in LNG available for bunkering, such increases could provide options for LNG bunkering in more ports. Estimating potential demand for LNG in the maritime sector is complicated and uncertain. One study of future LNG demand for bunkering, specifically, projects that LNG-powered vessels in operation and under construction as of June 2018 will require between 1.2 and 3.0 MMt of LNG per year. The study's review of several LNG consumption forecasts in the maritime sector shows a consensus projection between 20 to 30 MMt per year by 2030. This level of demand growth implies an increase in LNG-powered vessel construction from the current rate of around 120 ships per year to between 400 and 600 new builds per year. If these levels were reached, they could create a significant new market for LNG suppliers. Assuming a Henry Hub spot market price of $4/MMBtu in 2030, the annual market for LNG in shipping could be worth $2.9 billion to $5.8 billion, before accounting for liquefaction and transportation charges. Some studies have projected the LNG bunkering market to be even larger and to grow more quickly. However, key variables\u2014such as the prices of Henry Hub natural gas and crude oil, the number of new vessel orders, and the future costs of emissions technology\u2014are notoriously hard to predict with accuracy. Thus, it is not assured that natural gas consumption in the maritime sector will absorb more than a small amount of the global liquefaction capacity in development. The IMO sulfur standards apply to ship owners globally, as does the development of new LNG supply and bunkering infrastructure. In addition to these factors, domestic LNG bunkering also may be influenced by considerations more specific to the United States. These considerations include growth of the U.S. natural gas supply, domestic shipbuilding opportunities, and LNG safety and security."

In particular, the majority opinion highlighted one hypothetical discussed at oral argument, noting that \"a billboard for an unlicensed facility that says 'Choose Life' would have to surround that two-word statement with a 29-word statement from the government, in as many as 13 different languages.\" In this instance, the Court said, the notice would \"drown[] out the facility's own message,\" and therefore be unduly burdensome. If a commercial disclosure requirement is not a factual and uncontroversial disclosure related to the speaker's goods or services under Zauderer , courts will likely apply a heightened standard of review. Under prevailing Supreme Court precedent, if a provision does not qualify for Zauderer 's reasonableness review, a court may review the challenged regulation under Central Hudson . As discussed above, Central Hudson established the general standard of review for government restrictions on commercial speech. The Supreme Court described \"a four-part analysis:\" At the outset, we must determine whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment."

The regulations do not prevent inversions via merger and do not address earnings stripping by shifting debt to the U.S. firm, although Treasury has indicated future action in this area. In an inversion, the foreign subsidiaries of the original U.S. firm remain subsidiaries so that any dividends paid to the U.S. parent would be taxed. Regulations also treat other direct investments in U.S. property, such as loans to the U.S. parent, as dividends. Once a firm has inverted and the U.S. firm is now a subsidiary of a foreign parent, there are methods of accessing the earnings of overseas subsidiaries by transactions between the new foreign parent and the U.S. firm's foreign subsidiaries. The regulation is intended to address three such methods. First, the regulation prevents the access to funds by, for example, a loan from the U.S. company's foreign subsidiary to the new foreign parent (called \"hopscotching\"). Before the regulation, funds of this type could have been used to pay dividends to the individual shareholders or for other purposes. Under the regulation, acquiring any obligation (such as a loan) or stock of a foreign related person is treated as U.S. property subject to tax. Second, the regulation addresses \"decontrolling,\" where the foreign acquiring corporation issues a note or transfer of property for stock in the U.S. firm's foreign subsidiaries. If a majority of stock is obtained, the U.S. firm's subsidiary is no longer a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) and not subject to Subpart F, which taxes currently certain passive or easily shifted income. However, even a less than majority share can allow partial access to deferred earnings without a U.S. tax."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "The Colombian government also committed to a combined approach of both voluntary and forced manual eradication. The government's goal set for 2017 was eradicating 100,000 hectares of coca, 50,000 through forced manual eradication and 50,000 through \"crop substitution\" accords reached with coca farming households who would voluntary eradicate. At the U.S.-Colombia High Level Dialogue held in Bogot\u00e1 in March 2018, a renewed commitment to the enduring partnership between the United States and Colombia was announced. A major outcome was a U.S.-Colombia pledge to reduce illegal narcotics trafficking through expanded counternarcotics cooperation. The new goal set was to reduce Colombia's estimated cocaine production and coca cultivation to 50% of current levels by 2023. In addition, a memorandum of understanding was signed to combat the illegal gold mining that funds transnational criminal organizations. Although President Duque appears determined to pursue a more aggressive approach to drug policy, he has not clearly stated how his approach to counternarcotics will differ from that of his predecessor. The government may restart aerial eradication, a strategy that ended in 2015 due to the Colombian Health Ministry's concerns over cancer-causing potential of the herbicide glyphosate, but no precise plans for restarting the program have been announced in the Duque Administration's first three months in office. Experimentation with delivering glyphosate by drones (rather than planes) began in June 2018 under the Santos Administration and is continuing under the Duque government. On October 1, 2018, President Duque authorized police to confiscate and destroy any quantity of drugs found on persons in possession of them, resulting in the seizure of more than 7 metric tons of drugs in less than two weeks. This enforcement measure may violate a 1994 Colombian Constitutional Court ruling, however, in which Colombians may carry small doses of drugs for personal use, including marijuana, hashish, and cocaine."

      "D) Generalists can be assigned to work outside their career tracks, allowing for greater flexibility in filling generalist vacancies, while specialist positions often require strict adherence to specific skill sets."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A)",
    "documentation": [
      "According to State officials and staff at overseas posts, some vacant specialist positions are more difficult to fill than others because candidates for these positions must often possess skills in fields such as medicine or information technology that tend to be highly sought after in the private sector. According to staff at overseas posts, it is not uncommon for specialist candidates in these fields to choose higher- paying jobs in the private sector rather than specialist positions in the Foreign Service. Additionally, in some circumstances, State must compete with other federal agencies to recruit specialists from the same limited pool of talent. Consequently, according to State officials, State has been unable to attract and retain personnel with the skills necessary to fill some Foreign Service specialist positions, which has led to persistent vacancies in specialist positions. Vacancies in Foreign Service specialist positions at overseas posts present additional challenges because specialized skills and competencies are often required to perform the work of these positions. According to State officials, because Foreign Service generalists may be assigned to work outside of their career tracks, in some circumstances, State has more flexibility in filling a generalist vacancy than a specialist vacancy. For example, generalists outside the consular career track can serve as a consular officer for one or more tours of duty. However, specialist positions often require specialized skills or experience that generalists may not possess. In addition, according to staff at overseas posts, it is generally not possible for a Foreign Service specialist from one skill group to perform the work of a Foreign Service specialist from a different skill group. For instance, a Foreign Service specialist assigned to the medical section at a post will not be able to help address the workload of a vacant position in the information management section. Thus, according to staff at overseas posts, vacancies in specialist positions at the posts may create greater challenges than vacancies in generalist positions."

      "D) It will simplify the administration of the DST by reducing the number of entities subject to the tax."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "Where the MNCs subject to the statutory incidence of the tax bear at least a portion of the economic incidence of the DST, then they face a lower return to business investment in that country compared to firms not subject to the DST. Additionally, the UK DST's proposed exemption or \"safe harbor\" for \"low profit\" firms could create another layer of equity concerns. If the exemption is based on low profits as calculated by UK tax rules, then firms that are not subject to the UK corporate income tax (because they do not have a permanent establishment in the UK) will not be eligible for the exemption. In other words, if a firm must be subject to the UK corporate income tax to be eligible for exemption then, by definition, the exemption is not available to foreign MNCs. MNCs with similar amounts of global revenue would be subject to different effective tax rates on their worldwide consolidated earnings (across all related entities) based on whether they were subject to UK income taxes or not. An alternative exemption being considered by the UK, based on global consolidated profits, could have some administrative issues, as discussed in the next section of this report. DSTs present several administrative challenges to both the public and private sectors. With regard to the public sector, lawmakers and revenue-collecting agencies will have to clarify exactly what types of activities are subject to tax and which parties bear the statutory burden of paying tax. These decisions affect the costs of administering the tax or the gross revenue collected by the tax. With regard to the private sector, the decisions made by lawmakers and agencies could affect the costs of complying with DST regimes. Technology could present administrative challenges to the implementation of DST proposal. First, some digital economy platforms allow users to opt out of having their data tracked or resold to third parties. Without this information a digital service provider may be able to fulfill a user's desire for privacy, but the absence of the information limits the provider's ability to apply proper taxes based on the customer's jurisdiction."

    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "CSPF is a defined benefit multiemployer pension plan. Multiemployer plans are often created and maintained through collective bargaining agreements between labor unions and two or more employers, so that workers who move from job to job and employer to employer within an industry can continue to accrue pension benefits within the same plan over the course of their careers. Multiemployer plans are typically found in industries with many small employers such as trucking, building and construction, and retail food sales. In 2017, there were about 1,400 defined benefit multiemployer plans nationwide covering more than 10 million participants. Most multiemployer plans are jointly administered and governed by a board of trustees selected by labor and management. The labor union typically determines how the trustees representing labor are chosen and the contributing employers or an employer association typically determines how the trustees representing management are chosen. The trustees set the overall plan policy, direct plan activities, and set benefit levels (see fig. 1). Multiemployer plans are \u201cprefunded,\u201d or funded in advance, primarily by employer contributions. The employer contribution is generally negotiated through a collective bargaining agreement, and is often based on a dollar amount per hour worked by each employee covered by the agreement. Employer contributions are pooled in a trust fund for investment purposes, to pay benefits to retirees and their beneficiaries, and for administrative expenses. Multiemployer plan trustees typically decide how the trust fund should be invested to meet the plan\u2019s objectives, but the trustees can use investment managers to determine how the trust fund should be invested. Multiemployer plan trust funds can be allocated among many different types of assets, any of which can generally be passively- or actively-managed, domestically or internationally based, or publicly or nonpublicly traded (see table 1). A plan\u2019s funded percentage is its ratio of plan assets to plan liabilities."

    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "In October 2017, we recommended that the division no longer dual hat two individuals who had both programmatic and technical authority responsibilities. As of April 2018, NASA had taken steps to separate the engineering technical authority position from the programmatic position, and NASA\u2019s Chief of Safety and Mission Assurance said he planned to separate the safety position but had not yet completed that action. The Commercial Crew Program employs a similar structure to the Exploration Systems Development organization in that the safety technical authority is dual hatted simultaneously in a programmatic position as the Commercial Crew Program\u2019s Safety and Mission Assurance Manager. According to the program\u2019s safety technical authority, in his programmatic role for the program, he helps set priorities for safety issues, including how staff will be utilized to meet those priorities. In the technical authority role, he provides independent oversight in support of safety and mission success. In his dual-hatted role, this official will be responsible for endorsing the program\u2019s certification recommendations in two different capacities: as the technical authority and as a program authority. As a result, this structure relies on the same individual to completely separate two roles\u2014one to manage the Commercial Crew Program\u2019s safety issues within programmatic cost and schedule constraints, and the other to assess the same issues in an independent oversight role. While the Commercial Crew Program may have an additional level of separation between the safety technical authority and the program\u2019s involvement in the design of commercial systems due to its shared assurance model with the commercial providers, the Commercial Crew Program still maintains a structure where one individual simultaneously serves in both technical authority and programmatic roles. Figure 5 describes some of the conflicting roles and responsibilities of this official in his two different positions. During our review, officials cited several factors in support of a dual- hatted approach: The safety technical authority retains independence because his technical authority reporting path and performance reviews are not under the purview of the Commercial Crew Program chain of command."

      "The sample frames were then used as the basis for drawing our nonprobability samples of institutions for purposes of interviews and focus groups. To identify regulations that community banks and credit unions viewed as among the most burdensome, we conducted structured interviews and focus groups with a sample of a total of 64 community banks and credit unions. To reduce the possibility of bias, we selected the institutions to ensure that banks and credit unions with different asset sizes and from different regions of the country were included. We also included at least one bank overseen by each of the three primary federal depository institution regulators, Federal Reserve, FDIC, NCUA, and OCC in the sample. We interviewed 17 institutions (10 banks and 7 credit unions) about which regulations their institutions experienced the most compliance burden. On the basis of the results of these interviews, we determined that considerable consensus existed among these institutions as to which regulations were seen as most burdensome, including those relating to mortgage fees and terms disclosures to consumers, mortgage borrower and loan characteristics reporting, and anti-money laundering activities. As a result, we determined to conduct focus groups with institutions to identify the characteristics of the regulations identified in our interviews that made these regulations burdensome. To identify the burdensome characteristics of the regulations identified in our preliminary interviews, we selected institutions to participate in three focus groups of community banks and three focus groups of credit unions. For the first focus group of community banks, we randomly selected 20 banks among 647 banks between $500 million and $1 billion located in nine U.S. census geographical areas using the sample frame of community banks we developed, and contacted them asking for their participation. Seven of the 20 banks agreed to participate in the first focus group. However, mortgages represented a low percentage of the assets of two participants in the first focus group, so we revised our selection criteria because two of the regulations identified as burdensome were related to mortgages."

    "documentation": [
      "Procuring selected components in this manner under an MYP contract is called an economic order quantity (EOQ) purchase. EOQ purchases can reduce the procurement cost of the weapons being procured under the MYP contract by allowing the manufacturers of components to take maximum advantage of production economies of scale that are possible with batch orders. What gives the contractor confidence that the multiyear stream of business will materialize? At least two things give the contractor confidence that DOD will not terminate an MYP contract and that the multiyear stream of business consequently will materialize: For a program to qualify for MYP, DOD must certify, among other things, that the minimum need for the items to be purchased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the contract in terms of production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities. Perhaps more important to the contractor, MYP contracts include a cancellation penalty intended to reimburse a contractor for costs that the contractor has incurred (i.e., investments the contractor has made) in anticipation of the work covered under the MYP contract. The undesirability of paying a cancellation penalty acts as a disincentive for the government against canceling the contract. (And if the contract is canceled, the cancellation penalty helps to make the contractor whole.) Is there a permanent statute governing MYP contracting? There is a permanent statute governing MYP contracting\u201410 U.S.C. 2306b. The statute was created by Section 909 of the FY1982 Department of Defense Authorization Act ( S. 815 / P.L. 97-86 of December 1, 1981), revised and reorganized by Section 1022 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 ( S. 1587 / P.L. 103-355 of October 13, 1994), and further amended on several occasions since. For the text of 10 U.S.C. 2306b, see Appendix A . DOD's use of MYP contracting is further governed by DOD acquisition regulations.

Administration and Internal Guidance In addition to statutory requirements, the DOD and the Department of State are subject to guidance on OCO spending from the Administration. In October 2006 , under the Bush Administration, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England directed the services to break with long-standing DOD regulatory policies and expand their request for supplemental funding to reflect incremental costs related to the \"longer war on terror.\" There was no specific definition for the \"longer war on terror,\" now one of the core missions of the DOD. In February 2009, at the beginning of the Obama Administration, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued updated budget guidance that required DOD to move some OCO costs back into the base budget. However, within six months of issuing the new criteria, officials waived restrictions related to pay and that would have prohibited end-strength growth. In a letter from OMB to the then-Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) Robert Hale, the agency characterized its 2009 criteria as \"very successful\" for delineating base and OCO spending but stated, \"This update clarifies language, eliminates areas of confusion and provides guidance for areas previously unanticipated.\" GAO subsequently reported that the revised guidance significantly changed the criteria used to build the fiscal year 2010 OCO funding request by: specifying stricter definitions for repair and procurement of equipment; limiting applicability of OCO funds for RDT&E; excluding pay and allowances for end-strength above the level requested in the budget; excluding enduring family support initiatives; and excluding base realignment and closures (BRAC) amounts."

HUD compiled and provided custom extracts of data on households in RAD- converted properties from the Inventory Management System/Public and Indian Housing Information Center (IMS/PIC) (public housing and Section 8 PBV) and Tenant Rental Assistance Certification System (Section 8 PBRA). We assessed the reliability of the data extracts provided by HUD by (1) performing electronic testing of required data elements, (2) reviewing existing information about the data and the system that produced them, and (3) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We determined the data on PBV households were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives, but that the data on PBRA households was not sufficiently reliable for purposes of describing some characteristics of RAD households. For example, in trying to determine participation in the RAD program by year, we received several thousand PBRA entries that preceded the establishment of the RAD program. Moreover, as we previously mentioned, the postconversion household data for PBRA conversions is in a separate data system, so some variables, such as those related to race, ethnicity, rent, and income, differ from the other household data for that program. Because of these limitations, the data for PBRA households were not reliable for purposes of comparing RAD household characteristics before and after conversion as we had intended. To describe safeguards for residents and help ascertain how HUD implemented protections, we reviewed legal protections and requirements in HUD notices, reviewed selected conversion files, and interviewed HUD officials about monitoring and compliance processes."

As mentioned previously, prior to FY2012, the SBA reported Advocacy's total program cost, which includes funding provided through the salaries and expenses' executive direction subaccount, agency-wide overhead costs (rent, telecommunications, etc.), and other support costs (e.g., management and administrative support, including human resources support). From FY2000 to FY2005, the SBA provided relatively detailed information concerning Advocacy's budget, including the amount of funding Advocacy received through the salaries and expenses' executive direction subaccount. Also, Advocacy's FY2013 congressional budget justification document included the amount of funding Advocacy received through the salaries and expenses' executive direction subaccount in FY2011. However, those data are not available for FY2006-FY2010, and it was therefore necessary to estimate Advocacy's funding from the salaries and expenses' executive direction subaccount for those years. The estimates provided in the table were derived by multiplying Advocacy's total program cost for each of those fiscal years by 79%, which was the proportion of Advocacy's total program costs provided from the salaries and expenses' executive direction subaccount in FY2003, FY2004, and FY2005. The SBA's entrepreneurial development (ED) noncredit programs provide a variety of management and training services to small businesses.

This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. Manufacturer: Grumman Corporation (acquired by Northrop Grumman) The C-2A Greyhound Logistics Aircraft (C-2A) is a high-wing, twin-engine monoplane cargo aircraft first manufactured in 1965 (see fig. 20). It is designed to land on aircraft carriers, with a primary mission of providing critical logistics support to Carrier Strike Groups by transporting high-priority cargo, mail, and passengers between carriers and shore bases. The original C-2A aircraft were overhauled to extend their operational life in 1973 and again from 2004 through 2011. Total operating and support (O&S) costs for the C-2A have generally decreased from about $233 million in fiscal year 2011 to about $207 million in fiscal year 2016. Specifically, unit-level manpower, unit operations, and continuing system improvements have decreased, while maintenance costs have increased. landing gear, and avionics system, among others. The Navy will include an appendix for the C-2A when it updates the sustainment strategy for the E 2D for its 5-year update. C-2A completed a service life extension program from 2004 through 2011 to increase flight hours from 10,000 to 15,000 and landings from 16,020 to 36,000, among other things. Aircraft are maintained organically by field maintainers and at Navy Fleet Readiness Centers under a planned maintenance interval cycle with three planned maintenance interval events occurring consecutively every 24 months, and supply support is provided organically by the Naval Supply Systems Command and Defense Logistics Agency.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "Additionally, 6 of 10 pipeline operators we interviewed said cyber attacks from nation-state actors were a primary threat to their industry. Further, when TSA issued its revised Pipeline Security Guidelines in March 2018, it stated that its revisions to the guidelines were made to reflect the ever-changing threat environment in both the physical and cybersecurity realms. However, threats to cybersecurity are not specifically accounted for in the description of the risk assessment methodology. Recent Pipeline Modal and Cyber Modal Threat Assessments include cyber threats to the pipeline industry, but the description of the pipeline risk assessment\u2019s methodology does not specify what types of threat assessments (sources) are used to calculate its threat score. To better align with the guidance in the NIPP for documenting sources of information when conducting risk assessments, the Pipeline Security Branch should document the information used. Keeping the risk assessment updated with current information, as well as documenting those data sources, could help the Pipeline Security Branch ensure it is using its limited resources to review the pipeline systems with greater risk. Natural Hazard Threats to Pipelines The Transportation Systems Sector, of which pipelines are a part, is critical to the Pacific Northwest, but also at risk from natural hazards, like earthquakes. For example, according to the Department of Homeland Security, an earthquake in the Puget Sound region\u2014which relies on the transportation of crude oil from Alaska\u2014could cripple the ports of Seattle and Tacoma, as well as the Olympic and Williams Pipelines greatly impacting the Pacific Northwest Economic Region. Hurricanes are the most frequent disruptive natural hazard for the oil and natural gas subsector and can cause the shutdown of facilities in an area, even when the facilities themselves are not directly affected by the storms. For example, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the flow of petroleum into the New York area via pipeline from the Gulf Coast relies on the ability to move it through major terminals."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "Based on the analysis of space-planning options, OJP retained one of the three previous leases and leveraged telework to accommodate all employees into less space overall in one building. OJP achieved this objective by targeting 25 percent employee mobility and implementing hoteling. Concurrently, OJP officials explained that they introduced smaller workstations and used tenant-improvement allowance funds to reconfigure space for more flexible use. Physical reconfigurations included changing hard-walled office spaces with dedicated workstations to a primarily open office with few walls or dedicated workstations. According to OJP, it complemented these changes with investments in mobile IT for individual employees, improved IT capabilities in conference rooms and other collaborative spaces, and an emphasis on training employees to work well in a mobile office environment. For example, OJP officials said they installed Wi-Fi throughout the space, issued laptops and smart phones to employees, upgraded video-conferencing capabilities in conference rooms and collaborative spaces, and expanded tools for informal employee communication. According to OJP officials, through the consolidation, they said they achieved a utilization rate of 190 USF per person\u2014a decrease of 30 USF per person from the prior 220 utilization rate. This rate remained higher than DOJ\u2019s overall target and housed the same total number of employees\u2014about 1,000\u2014in about 50,000 fewer USF. OJP reports that the consolidation resulted in an estimated $3 million annual lease- cost savings. OJP also estimates additional savings from reduced transit subsidies, carbon emissions, and continuity of operations. Relative to GSA and OJP, CDC has made more limited use of telework in office space-planning. CDC officials told us that they have leveraged telework as a space-planning tool in many locations, but they have only documented doing so in one case. HHS expects each sub-agency to comply with its 170 USF per-person utilization-rate policy, and this policy suggests that planned space reductions should take telework into account."

Beyond managing its system modernization efforts, such as VistA, VA has to ensure the effective implementation of the IT acquisition requirements called for in FITARA. Pursuant to FITARA, in August 2016, the Federal CIO issued a memorandum that announced the Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI). According to OMB, this new initiative supersedes and builds on the results of FDCCI, and is also intended to improve the performance of federal data centers in areas such as facility utilization and power usage. Among other things, DCOI requires 24 federal departments and agencies, including VA, to develop plans and report on strategies (referred to as DCOI strategic plans) to consolidate inefficient infrastructure, optimize existing facilities, improve security posture, and achieve costs savings. Further, the memorandum establishes a set of five data center optimization metrics and performance targets intended to measure agency\u2019s progress in the areas of (1) server utilization and automated monitoring, (2) energy metering, (3) power usage effectiveness, (4) facility utilization, and (5) virtualization. The guidance also indicates that OMB is to maintain a public dashboard that will display consolidation-related costs savings and optimization performance information for the agencies. However, in a series of reports that we issued from July 2011 through August 2017, we noted that, while data center consolidation could potentially save the federal government billions of dollars, weaknesses existed in several areas, including agencies\u2019 data center consolidation plans, data center optimization, and OMB\u2019s tracking and reporting on related cost savings. Further, we previously reported that VA\u2019s progress toward closing data centers, and realizing the associated cost savings, lagged behind that of other covered agencies."

    "documentation": [
      "[when carrying out future operations against Iran-aligned targets in Syria].\" Since the September 2018 incident, Israeli air strikes appear to have decreased somewhat. On March 25, 2019, President Trump signed a proclamation stating that the United States recognizes the Golan Heights (hereinafter, the Golan) to be part of the State of Israel. The proclamation stated that \"any possible future peace agreement in the region must account for Israel's need to protect itself from Syria and other regional threats\" \u2014presumably including threats from Iran and the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah. Israel gained control of the Golan from Syria during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, and effectively annexed it unilaterally by applying Israeli law to the region in 1981 (see Figure 2 ). President Trump's proclamation changed long-standing U.S. policy on the Golan. Since 1967, successive U.S. Administrations supported the general international stance that the Golan is Syrian territory occupied by Israel, with its final status subject to negotiation. In reaction to the U.S. proclamation, others in the international community have insisted that the Golan's status has not changed. In Congress, Senate and House bills introduced in February 2019 ( S. 567 and H.R. 1372 ) support Israeli sovereignty claims to the Golan, and would treat the Golan as part of Israel in any existing or future law \"relating to appropriations or foreign commerce.\" For decades after 1967, various Israeli leaders, reportedly including Prime Minister Netanyahu as late as 2011, had entered into indirect talks with Syria aimed at returning some portion of the Golan as part of a lasting peace agreement. However, the effect of civil war on Syria and the surrounding region, including an increase in Iran's presence, may have influenced Netanyahu to shift focus from negotiating with Syria on a \"land for peace\" basis to obtaining international support for Israel's claims of sovereignty. As part of the periodic conflict in Syria between Israel and Iran , some Iranian missiles have targeted Israeli positions in the Golan."

    "documentation": [
      "If a report were presented on the floor, it would have to be done in executive session. Executive session and the Executive Calendar will be discussed in the next section. According to Senate Rule XXXI, the Senate cannot vote on a nomination the same day it is reported except by unanimous consent. It is fairly common for the Senate to discharge a committee from consideration of an unreported nomination by unanimous consent. This removes the nomination from the committee in order to allow the full Senate to consider it. When the Senate discharges a committee by unanimous consent, it is doing so with the support of the committee for the purposes of simplifying the process. It is unusual for Senators to attempt to discharge a committee by motion or resolution, instead of by unanimous consent, and only a few attempts have ever been successful. Senate Rule XVII does permit any Senator to submit a motion or resolution that a committee be discharged from the consideration of a subject referred to it. The discharge process, however, does not allow a simple majority to quickly initiate consideration of a nomination still in committee. It requires several steps and, most notably, a motion or resolution to discharge is debatable. This means that a cloture process may be necessary to discharge a committee. Cloture on a discharge motion or resolution requires the support of three-fifths of the Senate, usually 60 Senators, and several days. The Senate handles executive business, which includes both nominations and treaties, separately from its legislative business. All nominations reported from committee, regardless of whether they were reported favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation, are listed on the Executive Calendar , a separate document from the Calendar of Business , which lists pending bills and resolutions. Usually, the majority leader schedules the consideration of nominations on the Calendar. Nominations are considered in executive session, a parliamentary form of the Senate in session that has its own journal and, to some extent, its own rules of procedure."

      "National banks are accordingly \"governed in their daily course of business far more by the laws of the State than of the nation\" because their contracts, ability to acquire and transfer property, rights to collect debts, and liability to be sued for debts \"are all based on State law.\" The OCC has attempted to synthesize the relevant case law as establishing a general principle that state regulations of national banks are valid as long as they \"do not regulate the manner, content or extent of the activities authorized for national banks under federal law, but rather establish the legal infrastructure around the conduct of that business.\" Similarly, state-chartered banks are not wholly immune from federal law. Rather, state banks are subject to certain federal consumer protection, tax, and antidiscrimination laws, in addition to a range of Federal Reserve and FDIC regulations. A number of other legal developments have caused the regulatory treatment of national banks and state banks to converge. Beginning in the 1960s, many states passed so-called \"wild card\" statutes granting their banks the power to engage in any activities permitted for national banks. Statutes extending the powers of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have also ensured competitive equality in the opposite direction. In 1980, Congress enacted legislation requiring all state-chartered banks\u2014including those that do not join the FRS\u2014to abide by reserve requirements set by the Federal Reserve, eliminating the competitive advantage conferred by lower state-law reserve requirements. Similarly, in 1991, Congress enacted legislation prohibiting FDIC-insured state banks from engaging as a principal in activities that are not permitted for national banks absent permission from the FDIC. Because all states require the banks they charter to obtain FDIC insurance, the legislation \"had the ultimate effect of unifying the state and the federal banking systems.\" Finally, some federal statutes either explicitly or implicitly preempt state laws in ways that eliminate unequal regulatory treatment for national and state banks."

DOL estimates that the average annual cost for medical treatment in fiscal year 2017 was approximately $6,980 per miner. There were about 25,700 total beneficiaries (primary and dependents) receiving black lung benefits during fiscal year 2017 (see fig. 1). The decrease in the number of beneficiaries over time has resulted from a combination of declining coal mining employment and an aging beneficiary population, according to DOL officials. Further, black lung beneficiaries could increase in the near term due to the increased occurrence of black lung disease and its most severe form, progressive massive fibrosis, particularly among Appalachian coal miners, according to HHS officials. Black lung claims are processed by DOL\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs. Contested claims are adjudicated by DOL\u2019s Office of Administrative Law Judges, which issues decisions that can be appealed to the Benefits Review Board. Claimants and mine operators may further appeal these agency decisions to the federal courts. If an award is contested, claimants can receive interim benefits, which are generally paid from the Trust Fund according to DOL officials, while their claims are in the appeals process. Final awards are either funded by mine operators\u2014who are identified as the responsible employers of claimants\u2014or the Trust Fund, when responsible employers cannot be identified or do not pay. In fiscal year 2017, black lung claims had an approval rate of about 29 percent, according to DOL data. Of the 19,430 primary black lung beneficiaries receiving benefits during fiscal year 2017, 64 percent (12,464) were paid from the Trust Fund, 25 percent (4,798) were paid by liable mine operators, and 11 percent (2,168) were receiving interim benefits, according to DOL officials."

As a result, the estimate does not demonstrate that the program can meet its $11.4 billion cost cap. Cost growth for the lead ship was driven by challenges with technology development, design, and construction, compounded by an optimistic budget estimate."

    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "This, and the possibility of procuring carriers on 3- or 3.5-year centers, raises the possibility of using a block buy contract to procure three aircraft carriers: For example, if procurement of aircraft carriers were shifted to 3- or 3.5-year centers, a block buy contract for procuring CVN-80, CVN-81, and CVN-82 could span seven years (with the first ship procured in FY2018, and the third ship procured in FY2024) or eight years (with the first ship procured in FY2018 and the third ship procured in FY2025). The percentage cost reduction possible under a three-ship block buy contract could be greater than that possible under a two-ship block buy contract, but the offsetting issue of reducing congressional flexibility for changing aircraft carrier procurement plans in coming years in response to changing strategic or budgetary circumstances could also be greater. Appendix C. Cost Growth and Managing Costs Within Program Cost Caps This appendix presents additional background information on cost growth in the CVN-78 program, Navy efforts to stem that growth, and Navy efforts to manage costs so as to stay within the program's cost caps. October 2018 CBO Report An October 2018 CBO report on the potential cost of the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan states the following regarding the CVN-78 program: The Navy's current estimate of the total cost of the Gerald R. Ford , the lead ship of the CVN-78 class, is $13.0 billion in nominal dollars appropriated over the period from 2001 to 2018, an amount that is equal to the cost cap set in law. CBO used the Navy's inflation index for naval shipbuilding to convert that figure to $15.5 billion in 2018 dollars, or 23 percent more than the corresponding estimate when the ship was first authorized in 2008. Neither the Navy's nor CBO's estimate includes the $5 billion in research and development costs that apply to the entire class. Because construction of the lead ship is finished, CBO used the Navy's estimate for that ship to estimate the cost of successive ships in the class."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "Focus on high-risk retailers: We also found in 2006 that FNS had not conducted analyses to identify characteristics of retailers at high risk of trafficking and to target its resources\u2014a shortcoming FNS has since taken some steps to address. For example, we reported that some stores may be at risk of trafficking because one or more previous owners had been found trafficking at the same location. However, FNS did not have a system in place to ensure that these retailers were quickly targeted for heightened attention. In addition, once a store was authorized to participate in the program, FNS staff typically would not inspect the store again until it applied for reauthorization 5 years later. We recommended that FNS identify the stores most likely to traffic and provide earlier, more targeted oversight to those stores. In 2009, FNS began establishing risk levels for each authorized retailer, identifying high-risk stores as those with a prior permanent disqualification at that location or a nearby location. In 2013, FNS required all high-risk retailers to go through reauthorization and to provide additional documentation regarding store ownership. That same year, FNS also consolidated its retailer management functions, including those for authorizing stores and analyzing EBT transaction data, into a single national structure known as the Retailer Operations Division. FNS officials told us that this structure enables the agency to identify and deploy their investigative resources to the areas of highest risk nationally, rather than within a given region. Penalties to deter retailer trafficking: We also found in our 2006 report that FNS\u2019s penalties for retailer trafficking may be insufficient to deter traffickers, and since then, FNS has proposed\u2014but not finalized\u2014rules to increase them. FNS imposes administrative penalties for retailer trafficking\u2014generally a permanent disqualification from the program or a monetary penalty.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "Over time, USDA\u2019s FMD planned approach has evolved from relying solely on stamping out to including vaccination strategies as it became apparent that in many potential scenarios, reliance on stamping out alone would not be effective or feasible. Specifically, in 2010, USDA\u2019s Foot-and- Mouth Disease Response Plan: The Red Book (Red Book) first stated that APHIS would consider vaccination strategies such as vaccinate-to- slaughter and vaccinate-to-live. In 2014 APHIS updated the Red Book with the addition of a vaccinate-to-kill strategy to better distinguish what would happen to animals if they were not eligible for slaughter. By 2016, USDA had determined that complete stamping out of anything beyond a small FMD outbreak was not a viable, effective, or sustainable response strategy for the United States, according to USDA\u2019s FMD vaccination policy. Experiences in preparedness exercises and foreign outbreaks of FMD influenced a shift in USDA\u2019s planned approach toward vaccination strategies. In 2010, Japan and South Korea both experienced FMD outbreaks and initially relied on stamping out combined with strict movement restrictions. Japan stamped out about 300,000 cattle and swine, and South Korea stamped out about 150,000 cattle and 3 million swine\u2014a third of the country\u2019s total swine population. Despite these efforts, FMD continued to spread in both countries until they implemented vaccination strategies, according to USDA documents. A 2007 FMD preparedness exercise, sponsored by the Texas Animal Health Commission and USDA, found that killing and disposing of infected animals in a livestock-dense area like the Texas panhandle would not be feasible in a timely manner because of the large number of animals on infected premises (e.g., 50,000 to 75,000 head of cattle on large cattle feedlots). USDA learned that having vaccination strategies in place would be necessary to effectively respond to an FMD outbreak. If an FMD outbreak occurred, APHIS would select a response strategy or multiple strategies, or it would modify strategies to achieve its FMD response goals based on the unique circumstances of the outbreak, according to agency planning documents."

The process varies depending on an officer\u2019s grade and functional specialty, and State uses a variety of incentives to encourage Foreign Service employees to bid on difficult-to-fill posts. State groups countries of the world\u2014and corresponding U.S. overseas posts in these countries\u2014into areas of responsibility under six geographic regional bureaus: Bureau of African Affairs Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs Overseas posts report to State headquarters through their respective regional bureaus. For example, because the Bureau of African Affairs has responsibility for developing and managing U.S. policy concerning parts of the African continent, U.S. overseas posts in Nigeria report through the bureau to State headquarters. According to State officials, State maintains personnel data on State employees in its GEMS database. GEMS includes information on Foreign Service and Civil Service positions; in particular, it shows the total number of authorized Foreign Service positions at State and whether each position is currently filled or vacant. As displayed in figure 1, the GEMS data show that the majority of Foreign Service employees (73 percent) work in positions at overseas posts. However, some Foreign Service staff (27 percent) are assigned to positions in the United States, where they may complete required language or other training, serve as desk officers for the regional bureaus, or work in other functions at State headquarters. According to State data, the number of both staffed and vacant overseas Foreign Service positions increased between 2008 and 2018.

    "documentation": [
      "In 2019, Medicare also pays 63% of the cost of generic drugs dispensed during the coverage gap and enrollees pay 37%. (See Figure 2 .) By 2020, through a combination of manufacturer discounts and increased Medicare coverage, Part D enrollees will be responsible for 25% of the costs for brand-name and generic drugs in the coverage gap (the same as during the initial coverage period). Most plans offer actuarially equivalent benefits rather than the standard package, including alternatives such as reducing or eliminating the deductible, or using tiered cost sharing with lower cost sharing for generic drugs. Medicare's payments to plans are determined through a competitive bidding process, and enrollee premiums are tied to plan bids. Plans are paid a risk-adjusted monthly per capita amount based on their bids during a given plan year. Part D plan sponsors determine payments for drugs and are expected to negotiate prices. The federal government is prohibited from interfering in the price negotiations between drug manufacturers, pharmacies, and plans (the so-called \"non-interference clause\"). Part D also provides enhanced coverage for low-income enrolled individuals, such as persons who previously received drug benefits under Medicaid (known as \"dual eligibles\"\u2014enrollees in both Medicare and Medicaid). Additionally, certain persons who do not qualify for Medicaid, but whose incomes are below 150% of poverty, may also receive assistance for some portion of their premium and cost-sharing charges. The MMA included significant incentives for employers to continue to offer coverage to their retirees by providing a 28% federal subsidy. In 2019, the maximum potential subsidy per covered retiree is $2,264 for employers or unions offering drug coverage that is at least actuarially equivalent (called \"creditable\" coverage) to standard coverage. Employers or unions may select an alternative option (instead of taking the subsidy) with respect to Part D, such as electing to pay a portion of the Part D premiums."

      "According to OPM, to implement this authority, each agency must select one fixed retention period between 4 and 7 years and publish the retention in the agency\u2019s records disposition manual. We determined that some offices are misinterpreting OPM and NARA guidance by not selecting a specific number of years in their record- retention schedules. For example, three of the six policy record-retention schedules we reviewed did not establish a specific number of years for record retention. Specifically, record-retention policies for the Office of Information and Technology, VACO staff offices, and VBA specified the record-retention period for adverse action files as a range between 4 to 7 years rather than selecting a fixed retention period. For example, we found that the Records Control Schedule pertinent to VACO was dated June 30, 1967, without references to new or revised items since 1969. Our results are consistent with an October 2016 inspection conducted by NARA. The inspection report contained 16 findings and 19 recommendations for improvement of the records-management program at VA. Among the findings and recommendations were the following. Finding: The VA records management program has not ensured that the VACO maintains a current Records Management Handbook and a current Records Control Schedule, which together establish program objectives, responsibilities, and authorities for the creation, maintenance, and disposition of agency records. Recommendation: The Department Records Office must update and maintain the VACO handbook and the Records Control Schedule for Central Office Staff Offices and the Offices of the Assistant Secretaries to include specific Records Management roles and responsibilities for all VACO staff and to include mandates for implementation of records management policies and procedures in accordance with Federal statutes and regulations.

      "More specifically for the Coast Guard, without such data sharing, future TAP evaluations may not be able to assess the effectiveness of TAP delivery, hindering the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to make program adjustments to better prepare its servicemembers to successfully transition to life after military service. Coast Guard officials said migrating to DOD\u2019s TAP-IT Enterprise System will facilitate information sharing with interagency partners and that improving data completeness and reliability is a top priority for 2018. Given the sacrifices servicemembers have made to serve their country, it is imperative they are afforded every chance to adequately prepare for civilian life before leaving military service. In order to make a successful transition, servicemembers need to be well-positioned to get a job or make an informed decision about whether to pursue additional education or start a small business. As such, the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) serves a critically important function\u2014to give servicemembers the tools and information they need to successfully transition to life outside the military. Federal law requires that the Coast Guard ensure all eligible servicemembers participate in the program, but thousands of Coast Guard servicemembers may have transitioned without the support provided by TAP. Reliably tracking participation has proven to be a challenge for the Coast Guard, in part because it lacks a current Commandant Instruction that defines the roles and responsibilities of staff responsible for implementing TAP and ensuring complete and reliable data are collected. In preparing to issue an updated Commandant Instruction, the Coast Guard has taken a positive step toward addressing the limitations of its current TAP data, and will be better positioned to ensure compliance with VOW Act requirements using reliable data. In addition to collecting reliable data, the Coast Guard could further demonstrate its commitment to meeting TAP requirements by establishing formal performance goals that measure the extent to which Coast Guard servicemembers participate in TAP."

      "Because the Army has this additional data field, it can capture information on multiple types of harassment that may occur in a single incident. The other military services, in contrast, do not have this capability in their respective databases. To illustrate, if one case of sexual harassment involved both verbal and nonverbal forms of sexual harassment, the Army could choose a more specific characterization to describe the incident, while the other military services would characterize the incident in more general terms. ODMEO officials are considering adapting an existing system to track instances of sexual harassment department-wide. That system, called Force Risk Reduction (FR2), is currently used to track safety issues like military injuries, civilian workers\u2019 compensation claims, and casualty notifications at DOD. ODMEO recently completed a pilot of the system with the Marine Corps, the Navy, and the Army to test whether it would be useable for adaptation for sexual harassment data, and is planning a second pilot to include the Air Force and the National Guard Bureau. According to ODMEO officials, their adaptation of FR2 is intended to collect aggregate-level sexual harassment data from the military services, and the military services will continue to operate and rely on their individual databases to maintain more detailed case-level information on incidents. For example, ODMEO\u2019s adaptation of FR2 would not have details such as descriptions of specific incidents, or information on dates associated with investigations or appeals. These types of data will continue to be maintained in the service systems. ODMEO officials told us that their new data system, if implemented, is not designed to collect case-level details in order to avoid personally identifiable information.

For example, health care providers told us that in Washington, two to three infants may share a nursery room where trained caregivers provide them with non-pharmacologic treatment. In West Virginia, health care providers said infants are typically placed in individual nursery rooms where nurses provide them with non- pharmacologic treatment. The rooms in the West Virginia facility are also equipped with a rocking chair to encourage mothers to visit and provide this care as well. Health care providers told us that the facility currently offers one nursery room equipped with a bed to help prepare mothers on what to expect after discharge; they also said that they encourage mothers to spend the night prior to the infant\u2019s discharge from the facility. (See text box below). Treating infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in a neonatal withdrawal center One health care provider from a neonatal withdrawal center told us that the practice of rooming-in helps to facilitate the bond between the mother and infant. He also said that rooming-in allows health care providers to model care for the mothers and for mothers to learn how to care for their infants with NAS. Health care providers told us that the facility currently offers one nursery room equipped with a bed to help prepare mothers on what to expect after discharge and that they encourage mothers to spend the night prior to the infant\u2019s discharge from the facility. One health care provider told us that one mother, after staying overnight with her infant, realized that she was not prepared to take care of her infant and consequently gave up custody of the infant. Because of rooming-in, health care providers were able to ensure that the infant was safe because the mother came to this realization at the facility, rather than alone at home. Although the lack of physical space at the facility currently makes it difficult to accommodate rooming-in for the entire course of the infant\u2019s treatment, these providers noted the importance of this practice and that they are committed to parental involvement when treating infants with NAS at their facility."

      "However, because the United States was not in a state of war and the suspended transactions were primarily domestic, the President's authority to issue such an order was dubious. Despite the tenuous legality, Congress ratified Roosevelt's actions by passing the Emergency Banking Relief Act three days after his proclamation. The act amended Section 5(b) of TWEA to read: During time of war or during any other period of national emergency declared by the President , the President may, through any agency that he may designate, or otherwise, investigate, regulate, or prohibit.... This amendment gave the President the authority to declare that a national emergency existed and assume extensive controls over the national economy previously only available in times of war. By 1934, Roosevelt had used these extensive new powers to regulate \"Every transaction in foreign exchange, transfer of credit between any banking institution within the United States and any banking institution outside of the United States.\" With America's entry into the Second World War in 1941, Congress again amended TWEA to grant the President extensive powers over the disposition of private property, adding the so-called \"vesting\" power, which authorized the permanent seizure of property. Now in its most expansive form, TWEA authorized the President to declare a national emergency and, in so doing, to regulate foreign exchange, domestic banking, possession of precious metals, and property in which any foreign country or foreign national had an interest. The Second World War ended in 1945. Following the conflict, the allied powers constructed institutions and signed agreements designed to keep the peace and to liberalize world trade. However, the United States did not immediately resume a peacetime posture with respect to emergency powers. Instead, the onset of the Cold War rationalized the continued use of TWEA and other emergency powers outside the context of a declared war. Over the next several decades, Presidents declared four national emergencies under Section 5(b) of TWEA and assumed expansive authority over economic transactions in the postwar period."

It then uses examples from past federal action on election administration to illustrate some of the ways the duties and structures of state and local election systems interact with federal activity. It closes by introducing some considerations that may be relevant to Members interested in election administration. This report focuses on the administration of federal elections in the states by executive and legislative branches of state and local government. Much of the discussion applies to nonfederal as well as federal elections, but the report is intended explicitly to address only federal elections. The report also does not cover the federal role in administering federal elections, election administration in the U.S. territories, the role of law enforcement and the courts in election administration, or issues of constitutional or legal interpretation. The typical federal election process has three main parts: voter registration, vote casting, and vote counting. This report focuses on those three parts of the process rather than on other aspects of campaigns and elections, such as campaign finance and redistricting. Finally, the way federal elections are administered varies between and within states. A full accounting of the variations is beyond the scope of this report. Instead, the report describes general patterns and illustrates them with examples. Examples appear in text boxes like the box below, which describes the role the text boxes play in the report in more detail. Election administration involves making decisions about the rules of elections, such as whether voters should be able to register online, whether they should be required to show photo identification at the polls, and whether election results should be audited. It also involves conducting elections in accordance with those decisions and paying for the activities and resources required to conduct them."

    "documentation": [
      "While an improved model may provide a more realistic calculation of the MPL, by changing the resulting estimates it can also change the balance between the federal government\u2019s exposure to liability costs and the amount of insurance launch companies are required to purchase. For example, if the more realistic results produced by the revised methodology increased the MPL estimates, this would increase insurance costs for the launch companies and reduce the federal government\u2019s exposure, thereby shifting the balance of costs between the two and suggesting a reevaluation of the thresholds. In addition, FAA officials told us that they had not reevaluated the probability thresholds upon implementing the revised MPL methodology, although defining these thresholds is their primary mechanism for adjusting the balance of risk between launch companies and the federal government. Agency officials acknowledged that an examination of the thresholds\u2019 continued appropriateness would be warranted in the future. However, they told us that changing the probability thresholds would require significant effort because it would require them to change federal regulations and that resources are currently allocated to other rulemaking priorities. Nevertheless, without evaluating the appropriateness of the probability threshold as part of the mandated evaluation of the MPL methodology, FAA cannot ensure that the federal government is not exposed to greater liability costs than intended or that launch companies are not required to purchase more insurance coverage than necessary. CSLCA also required FAA to consider the cost impact on both the commercial space launch industry and the federal government of implementing an updated MPL methodology. In its report to Congress, the agency discussed indirect costs to launch applicants and the federal government. For example, FAA discussed indirect data burden costs on launch company applicants and FAA analysts associated with the agency\u2019s risk profile method implementation."

      "For example, USAID/OFDA responded to the effects of Hurricane Matthew in Haiti in October 2016, as seen in figure 4, including helping temporarily displaced people. DOD assists in the U.S. government response to overseas disasters, including helping people displaced by such disasters, regardless of the cause of the disaster. These efforts are not specific to climate change as a driver of migration. For example, officials from DOD\u2019s geographic combatant commands said that, to the extent they address climate change, migration is not a focus of those efforts and they view migration as caused by security and economic issues. Between fiscal years 2014 and 2018, Congress has appropriated to DOD between $103 and $130 million per year for Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid. Officials said that the geographic combatant commands use most of this funding for steady state humanitarian assistance related to health, education, basic infrastructure, and disaster preparedness with a smaller amount set aside for immediate disaster assistance although that varies based on emergency requirements. DOD officials said that they have not seen any changes to this funding or associated activities with the change of administrations in fiscal year 2017. DOD officials we spoke with also emphasized that USAID/OFDA is the lead agency for the U.S. government\u2019s response to disasters overseas. USAID/OFDA formally requested DOD support on about 10 percent of the foreign disaster assistance provided by USAID/OFDA, according to USAID data for fiscal year 2014 through June 2018 and DOD officials. DOD assistance is typically provided for the largest, most complex disasters, according to agency officials. According to a July 2015 assessment conducted by the geographic combatant commands, while their activities vary, each command works with partner nations to increase their abilities to reduce the risks and effects from environmental impacts and climate-related events, including severe weather and other hazards."

      "HUD\u2019s public housing and Section 8 databases contain information on such households. Second, as previously mentioned, HUD plans to review resident logs only when there is a risk of noncompliance, but they collect household information in their databases on a rolling basis. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government require agencies to use quality information to achieve their objectives, and obtain and evaluate relevant and reliable data in a timely manner for use in effective monitoring. Without a comprehensive review of household information\u2014one based on information in HUD data systems as well as resident logs\u2014HUD cannot reasonably assess the effects of ongoing and completed RAD conversions on residents and compliance with resident safeguards, as discussed in the next section. HUD has not yet developed monitoring procedures for certain resident safeguards under the RAD program. RAD requirements include those intended to ensure that residents whose units are converted through RAD are informed about the conversion process; can continue to live in a converted property following RAD conversion; are afforded certain protections carried over from the public housing are afforded a phase-in of any rent increases under Section 8 program requirements. Currently, based on HUD notice requirements, PHAs must document compliance with three safeguards (PHA plan amendments, resident notification, and procedural rights) in their RAD application and other conversion paperwork. For example, PHAs must submit comprehensive written responses to resident comments received in connection with the required resident meetings with their RAD application. For one safeguard, PHAs are not required to report to HUD but must retain documentation of compliance to be made available to HUD as part of the monitoring for the program. For others, the HUD notice does not specify reporting and monitoring requirements. Based on our review of files for selected conversions, which we previously discussed, we found PHAs generally submitted documentation of their efforts to inform residents about RAD conversion, such as providing evidence to HUD of meetings with residents and written responses to resident questions as required."

    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "FEMA\u2019s mission is to help people before, during, and after disasters. It provides assistance to those affected by emergencies and disasters by supplying immediate needs (e.g., ice, water, food, and temporary housing) and providing financial assistance grants for damage to personal or public property. FEMA also provides non-disaster assistance grants to improve the nation\u2019s preparedness, readiness, and resilience to all hazards. FEMA accomplishes a large part of its mission through awarding grants to state, local, and tribal governments and nongovernmental entities to help communities prevent, prepare for, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from disasters and terrorist attacks. As previously mentioned, for fiscal years 2005 through 2014, the agency obligated about $104.5 billion in disaster relief grants. In addition, as of April 2018, the four major disasters in 2017\u2014hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria; and the California wildfires\u2014had resulted in over $22 billion in FEMA grants. The current FEMA grants management environment is highly complex with many stakeholders, IT systems, and users. Specifically, this environment is comprised of 45 active disaster and non-disaster grant programs, which are grouped into 12 distinct grant categories. For example, one program in the Preparedness: Fire category is the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program, which provides grants to fire departments, nonaffiliated emergency medical service organizations, and state fire training academies to support firefighting and emergency response needs. As another example, the Housing Assistance grant program is in the Recovery Assistance for Individuals category and provides financial assistance to individuals and households in geographical areas that have been declared an emergency or major disaster by the President. Table 1 lists FEMA\u2019s non-disaster and disaster-based grant categories. According to FEMA, the processes for managing these different types of grants vary because the grant programs were developed independently by at least 18 separate authorizing laws that were enacted over a 62-year period (from 1947 through 2009)."

      "D) Variations in how agencies handle non-response cases during their improper payment estimation processes can affect the comparability of estimates across programs."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A)",
    "documentation": [
      "Although the OMB guidance was revised in October 2014 to implement this requirement, IRS has not updated its estimation methodology for EITC. By not updating its guidance and continuing to remove EITC overpayments that may be subsequently recovered, IRS is understating its improper payment estimate and potentially limits its ability to address these types of improper payments before they occur. Improper payments are a long-standing, significant problem in the federal government. Estimation of improper payments is key to understanding the extent of the problem and to developing effective corrective actions to address it. Among the six agencies we reviewed, processes to estimate improper payments in their programs varied, and certain differences in these processes may affect the quality of the resulting estimates and consequently these agencies\u2019 efforts to reduce improper payments. Specifically, policies and procedures for DOD\u2019s Military Pay and OPM\u2019s Retirement programs\u2019 improper payment estimation methodologies do not address certain key risks, like eligibility, in part because these agencies have not fully assessed their processes. Further, although OMB guidance addresses requirements for sampling, it does not address how agencies test to identify improper payments. Without such assessments and guidance, there is increased risk that agencies\u2019 processes may not address key risks of improper payments in their programs, calling into question the improper payment estimates for such programs and their usefulness for developing effective corrective actions. Additionally, for agencies we reviewed that contact outside entities as part of their improper payment estimation processes, the treatment of cases of nonresponse varied. OMB guidance does not specifically address the appropriate treatment of nonresponse cases for improper payment estimation purposes. Without clearer guidance there is increased risk that agencies\u2019 improper payment estimates may be understated and that estimates for similar programs may not be comparable."

    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "In fact, in the Spratlys, no state has made a specific legal claim about its maritime entitlements around the features it occupies. In other words, not only are there no \"excessive claims,\" there are no clear claims to jurisdiction over water space at all. Jurisdictional claims by a coastal state begin with an official announcement of baselines\u2014often accompanied by detailed geographic coordinates\u2014to put other states on notice of the water space the coastal state claims as its own. China has made several ambiguous claims over water space in the South China Sea. It issued the notorious 9-dashed line map, for instance, and has made cryptic references that eventually it might claim that the entire Spratly Island area generates maritime zones as if it were one physical feature. China has a territorial sea law that requires Chinese maritime agencies only to employ straight baselines (contrary to international law). And it formally claimed straight baselines all along its continental coastline, in the Paracels, and for the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, which China claims and Japan administers. All of these actions are contrary to international law and infringe on international navigational rights. These have all been subject to American FONOPs in the past\u2014and rightly so. They are excessive claims. But China has never specified baselines in the Spratlys. Accordingly, no one knows for sure where China will claim a territorial sea there. So for now, since there is no specific legal claim to push against, a formal FONOP is the wrong tool for the job. The U.S. Navy can and should simply exercise the full, lawful measure of high seas freedoms in and around the Spratly Islands. Those are the right tools for the job where no actual coastal state claim is being challenged. Second, the conflation of routine naval operations with the narrow function of a formal FONOP needlessly politicizes this important program, blurs the message to China and other states in the region, blunts its impact on China's conduct, and makes the program less effective in other areas of the globe."

      "If a court does not order restitution, or orders partial restitution, it is required to provide the reason for its decision and to provide that reason to USSC, but our analysis showed USSC did not always have these data. Specifically, from fiscal years 2014 through 2016, we found that restitution was not ordered\u2014and no reason was documented in USSC data for that decision\u2014for 9,848 offenders (5 percent of the 214,578 offenders sentenced during this time period). Information on offenders\u2019 sentences, including restitution, assists USSC in its continuous reexamination of its guidelines and policy statements and ensures that various sentencing practices are achieving their stated purposes. Further, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that management should evaluate issues identified through monitoring activities or reported by personnel to determine whether any of the issues rise to the level of an internal control deficiency. In response to our questions about the missing information on reasons why restitution was not ordered, AOUSC and USSC officials stated that they were unaware of the missing information or why it was missing. Judiciary officials stated that because various entities within the judiciary participate in the process of collecting and recording information on reasons restitution was not ordered, they did not know which entities could take action to improve USSC data. However, as previously discussed, if the court does not order restitution, or orders only partial restitution, the judge must provide the reason, and judges usually do so in a written Statement of Reasons form. The Judicial Conference, along with USSC, has developed guidance to help judges fill out the Statement of Reasons form and AOUSC supports the Judicial Conference in carrying out its policies. Further, courts must provide USSC the written Statement of Reasons form for sentences imposed. USSC is also responsible for collecting, analyzing, and distributing information on federal sentences provided by each district court, including information related to orders for restitution."

      "A May 2018 report by Insight Crime identified more than 120 high-level Venezuelan officials who have engaged in criminal activity. The report analyzes how the Venezuelan military, particularly the National Guard, has been involved in the drug trade since 2002 and colluded with other illegally armed groups. Another Bacrim, Los Rastrojos, reportedly controls important gasoline smuggling routes between Venezuela and Colombia in 2018. Similarly, in the past year, ELN guerrillas reportedly have moved from seeking safe haven in Venezuela to taking control of illicit gold mining areas near Venezuela's border with Guyana. Both the ELN, which is still engaged in armed conflict with the Colombian government, and its rival, the Popular Liberation Army (EPL), reportedly recruit Venezuelans to cultivate coca in Colombia. Human trafficking and sexual exploitation of Venezuelan migrants throughout Colombia is prevalent. Dissident FARC guerrillas are using border areas and other remote areas in the countryside to regroup and could eventually seek to consolidate into a more unified organization or coordinate with other criminal groups sheltering in Venezuela. The State Department's 2017 terrorism report published in April 2018 maintained that the number of terrorist incidents in Colombia\u2014carried out by the FARC and ELN\u2014decreased significantly, by 40%, over the already much-diminished level of 2016. ELN aggression included high-impact attacks, such as launching mortars at police stations and bombing pipelines, although the report also states that ELN demobilizations and surrenders have increased. The humanitarian crisis in Venezuela has set in motion a mass exodus of desperate migrants, who have come temporarily (or for extended stays) to Colombia. Although Venezuela has experienced hyperinflation (the highest in the world), a rapid contraction of its economy, and severe shortages of food and medicine, as of November 2018 Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has refused most international humanitarian assistance."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "The first 28 ships are known as Flight I/II DDG-51s. The next 34 ships, known as Flight IIA DDG-51s, incorporate some design changes, including the addition of a helicopter hangar. No DDG-51s were procured in FY2006-FY2009. The Navy during this period instead procured three Zumwalt (DDG-1000) class destroyers. The DDG-1000 design does not use the Aegis system and does not include a capability for conducting BMD operations. Navy plans do not call for modifying the three DDG-1000s to make them BMD-capable. Procurement of DDG-51s resumed in FY2010, following procurement of the three DDG-1000s. A total of 20 DDG-51s were procured in FY2010-FY2019. DDG-51s procured in FY2017 and subsequent years are being built to a new version of the DDG-51 design called the Flight III version. The Flight III version is to be equipped with a new radar, called the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) or the SPY-6 radar, that is more capable than the SPY-1 radar installed on all previous Aegis cruisers and destroyers. Sales of the Aegis system to allied countries began in the late 1980s. Allied countries that now operate, are building, or are planning to build Aegis-equipped ships include Japan, South Korea, Australia, Spain, and Norway. Most of Japan's Aegis-equipped ships are currently BMD-capable, and Japan plans to make all of them BMD-capable in coming years. The Aegis-equipped ships operated by South Korea, Australia, Spain, and Norway are not BMD-capable. Aegis ships are given a capability for conducting BMD operations by incorporating changes to the Aegis system's computers and software, and by arming the ships with BMD interceptor missiles. In-service Aegis ships can be modified to become BMD-capable ships, and DDG-51s procured in FY2010 and subsequent years are being built from the start with a BMD capability. The Aegis BMD system exists in several variants. Listed in order of increasing capability, these include (but are not necessarily limited to) 3.6.X variant, the 4.0.3 variant, the 4.1 variant (also known as the Aegis Baseline [BL] 5.4 variant), the 5.0 CU (Capability Upgrade) variant (also known as the BL 9.1 variant), the 5.1 variant (also known as the BL 9.2 variant), and the 6.X variant (also known as the BL 10 variant)."

      "Moreover, in recent years, we have found that many of the projects within the agency\u2019s major project portfolio have improved their cost and schedule performance. Nevertheless, the extent to which NASA has adopted some of the following lessons learned within its portfolio of major projects is mixed, and NASA has an opportunity to strengthen its program management of major acquisitions, including its space telescopes, by doing so. Manage Cost and Schedule Performance for Large Projects to Limit Implications for Entire Portfolio. In 2013, following JWST\u2019s cost increases and schedule growth, we found that though cost and schedule growth can occur on any project, increases associated with NASA\u2019s most costly and complex missions can have cascading effects on the rest of the portfolio. For example, we found that the JWST cost growth would have reverberating effects on the portfolio for years to come and required the agency to identify $1.4 billion in additional resources over fiscal years 2012 through 2017, according to Science Mission Directorate officials. NASA identified approximately half of this required funding from the four science divisions within the Science Mission Directorate account. The majority of the cuts were related to future high priority missions, missions in the operations and sustainment phase, and research and analysis. In essence, NASA had to mortgage future high priority missions and research to address JWST\u2019s additional resource needs. Similarly, the National Academy of Sciences has concluded in the past that it is important for NASA to have a clearly articulated and consistently applied method for prioritizing why and how its scarce fiscal resources are apportioned with respect to the science program in general and on a more granular level among component scientific disciplines. The academy noted that failure to do so could result in a loss of capacity, capability, and human resources in a number of scientific disciplines and technological areas that may take a generation or more to reconstitute once eliminated."

    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "Similarly, some tribal stakeholders stated that providers heavily redacted deployment information (which providers may consider proprietary) or required the tribe sign non-disclosure agreements to access deployment data. According to one tribal stakeholder, these non-disclosure agreements could possibly require tribes to waive tribal sovereign immunity in order to view the data. Some of the industry stakeholders we interviewed stated that they attempt to engage with tribes but the level of responsiveness from tribes varies. For example, some stakeholders stated that they send letters and do not hear back from tribes. One stakeholder stated that they make repeated attempts to contact tribes when they do not hear back after their initial contact, while another stated that a provider meets regularly with some tribes. Although FCC stated in its 2012 guidance that it would update the tribal engagement guidance and develop best practices based on feedback from tribal governments and broadband providers, it has taken limited steps to obtain such feedback from providers and tribal governments to determine whether its guidance is enabling meaningful tribal engagement. Additionally, FCC has not updated the guidance or issued best practices. Thus, FCC has limited information regarding whether its tribal engagement requirement is fulfilling its intended purpose. FCC officials we interviewed said that the Office of Native Affairs and Policy (ONAP) provided information and, in some cases, held training sessions about the tribal engagement obligation during workshops with tribal representatives, and encouraged representatives to contact ONAP with any concerns. ONAP officials also noted that they handle complaints from tribes regarding a lack of provider engagement and reach out to providers to address tribal concerns. ONAP officials stated that they have had internal discussions about whether the guidance is clear or needs revision, but this has not gone beyond internal discussions. A few of the tribal stakeholders provided examples of the benefits of providers engaging with tribes to ensure tribal representatives have access to information regarding broadband availability on their lands."

    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "That figure includes: 11,958 primarily in Afghanistan (OFS); 5,765 primarily in Iraq and Syria (OIR); 59,463 for in-theater support; and 16,610 primarily in the continental United States (CONUS) or otherwise mobilized (see Figure 10 ). The number of personnel actually in-country or in-theater at any given time may exceed or fall below those assumed levels. The FY2019 force level assumes an increase of 3,153 personnel (3.5%) from the FY2018 assumed level, all of which is assumed for in-theater support. (For analysis of troop level and budget trends, see the section, \" Trends in OCO Funding and Troop Levels ,\" earlier in this report.) As previously discussed, DOD acknowledges \"OCO funding has not declined at the same rate as the in-country troop strength \u2026 due to the fixed, and often inelastic, costs of infrastructure, support requirements, and in-theater presence to support contingency operations.\" The departments lists the following as OCO cost drivers: In-theater support, including infrastructure costs like command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) and base operations for U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) locations; Persistent demand for combat support such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets used to enhance force protection; Equipment reset, which lags troop level changes and procurement of contingency-focused assets like munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles and force protection capabilities that may not be linked directly to in-country operations; and International programs and deterrence activities, which are linked to U.S. engagement in contingency operations and support U.S. interests but are not directly proportional to U.S. troop presence. DOD also breaks down the FY2019 OCO budget request by functional category (see Table 3 ). By this measure, the largest portion of OCO funding was $20 billion for in-theater support, followed by operations and force protection (including the incremental cost of military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and other countries), at $14.7 billion; and unspecified classified programs, at $9.9 billion."

    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "That attack killed at least 305 people, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in Egypt's modern history. Combating terrorism in the Sinai is particularly challenging due to an array of factors, including the following: Geograph y : The peninsula's interior is mountainous and sparsely populated, providing militants with ample freedom of movement. Demograph y and Culture : The Sinai's northern population is a mix of Palestinians and Bedouin Arab tribes whose relationship to the state is filled with distrust. Sinai Bedouin have faced discrimination and exclusion from full citizenship and access to the economy. In the absence of development, a black market economy based primarily on smuggling has thrived, further contributing to the popular portrayal of Bedouin as outlaws. State authorities charge that the Sinai Bedouin seek autonomy from the central government, while residents insist on obtaining basic rights, such as property rights, full citizenship, and access to government services such as education and health care. Econom ics : Bedouins claim that Egypt has underinvested in northern Sinai, channeling development toward southern tourist destinations that cater to foreign visitors. Northern Sinai consists of mostly flat desert terrain inhospitable to large-scale agriculture without significant investment in irrigation. For decades, the Egyptian state has claimed to follow successive Sinai development plans. However, Egyptian governance and development of the Sinai has been hampered by corruption. Diploma cy : The 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty limits the number of soldiers that Egypt can deploy in the Sinai, subject to the parties' ability to negotiate changes as circumstances necessitate. Egypt and Israel mutually agree upon any short-term increase of Egypt's military presence in the Sinai. Since Israel returned control over the Sinai to Egypt in 1982, the area has been partially demilitarized, and the Sinai has served as an effective buffer zone between the two countries."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "If an agency has not submitted a disputed action to Congress, it is possible that this inaction was the result of the agency's view that the rule was not subject to the CRA. A GAO opinion stating that an agency action does constitute a rule, while not itself rendering a rule ineffective, may be the first indication to the agency that the rule did not \"take effect\" because the agency did not fulfill the CRA submission requirement. But in the context of agency rules that inherently lack legal effect, the determination that they lack \"effect\" under the CRA may not have much practical impact. In the context of rulemaking, to \"take effect\" usually means that something has become legally effective. As noted, however, the CRA encompasses some non-legislative rules that inherently lack legal effect. The fact that the CRA requires agencies to submit some agency statements that lack legal effect suggests that the term \"effect,\" as used in the CRA's submission requirement, means something other than legal effect. While reviewing notice-and-comment rulemakings, some courts have held that the CRA suspends a rule's operation notwithstanding the fact that a rule may technically have become effective. With respect to rules such as general policy statements that generally lack legal force, however, even if an agency failed to comply with the CRA's submission requirement and erroneously regarded the rule as being operative, it is less likely that the operation of the statement had a discernible and independent effect on the agency's actions. This section briefly summarizes each of the 21 GAO opinions to date on whether certain agency actions were rules and, thus, eligible for disapproval under the CRA. When GAO appeared to consider one or more of the CRA exceptions to the definition of \"rule\" as fundamental to its analysis, the summaries identify which exception GAO focused on in its opinion. The opinions are listed in chronological order by the date on which GAO issued the opinion. For a more concise summary of each of these opinions, see the table in Appendix B ."

      "D) User fees are the only way to fund programs that provide special benefits to identifiable recipients above and beyond the general public."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A)",
    "documentation": [
      "In other cases, federal agencies rely on broader authorities to impose user fees. User fees have several advantages as a means of financing public activities. They are voluntary, they connect the burden of financing activities to those who directly benefit from them, and they can help decentralize decisionmaking by bypassing centralized allocation of resources. At times, proposals to raise fees may encounter less political resistance than proposals to raise an equivalent sum via taxes. On the other hand, the flow of user fees and charges may reflect fluctuations in economic conditions, which may complicate the financing of government operations. Some are also concerned that funding arrangements may bypass regular congressional scrutiny and dilute Congress's power of the purse. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) defines a user fee as a fee assessed to users for goods or services provided by the federal government. User fees generally apply to federal programs or activities that provide special benefits to identifiable recipients above and beyond what is normally available to the public. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines the term user charge to include transactions not normally considered fees, such as land or asset sales. OMB's budget preparation documents state that user charges include not only proceeds from selling postage stamps, electricity, and Medicare Part B premiums, but also sales of assets and natural resources, among other categories. The federal government, which operates on a modified cash accounting basis, does not recognize in its budgetary accounts the loss of asset values when it sells assets or natural resources, as a private firm would using typical business accounting methods. For instance, if the government were to sell oil at a price of $60 per barrel that it bought at $120 per barrel, only the current revenues would be reflected in budget accounts. A private firm would normally adjust its balance sheet to reflect a loss. OMB designates whether each account receives collections associated with user charges, and that information is contained within OMB's MAX budget data system."

It is for this reason that the act authorizes the Administration to determine within any industry the concerns which are to be designated small-business concerns for the purposes of the act. The report did not provide specific guidance concerning what the committee might consider to be small, but it did indicate that data on industry employment, as of March 31, 1948, \"reveals that on the basis of employment, small business truly is small in size. Of the approximately 4 million business concerns, 87.4% had fewer than 8 employees and 95.2% of the total number of concerns, employed fewer than 20 people.\" Initially, the SBA created two sets of size standards, one for federal procurement preferences and another for the SBA's loan and management training services. At the request of federal agencies, the SBA adopted the then-prevailing small business size standard used by federal agencies for procurement, which was no more than 500 employees. The SBA retained the right to make exceptions to the no more than 500 employee procurement size standard if the SBA determined that a firm having more than 500 employees was not dominant in its industry. For the SBA's loan and management training services, the SBA's staff reviewed economic data provided by the Census Bureau to arrive at what Wendell Barnes, SBA's Administrator, described at a congressional hearing in 1956 as \"a fairly accurate conclusion as to what comprises small business in each industry.\""

      "Our 2017 survey data also indicate that agencies may not be effectively communicating to their employees about contributions to CAP goals or progress toward achieving APGs. Of the estimated 54 percent of federal managers who indicated they were familiar with CAP goals, 23 percent reported that their agency has communicated to its employees on those goals to a great or very great extent. Of the 74 percent of federal managers who indicated familiarity with APGs, 44 percent reported that their agency has communicated on progress toward achieving those goals to great or very great extent. Our prior work has shown that agencies should consider users\u2019 differing needs\u2014for accessibility, accuracy, completeness, consistency, ease of use, timeliness, and validity, among others things\u2014to ensure that performance information will be both useful and used. GPRAMA introduced several requirements that could help to address aspects of usefulness, such as requiring agencies to disclose more information about the accuracy and validity of their performance data and actions to address limitations to the data. However, agencies face challenges in ensuring their performance information is useful, with one instance from our past work described in the text box below. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Could Improve Usefulness of Information in Planned Grantee Portal EPA monitors performance reports and program-specific data from grantees to ensure that grants achieve environmental and other program results. However, in July 2016, we found that EPA\u2019s 2014 internal analysis of its grants management business processes identified improvements that, if implemented into EPA\u2019s planned web-based portal, could improve the accessibility and usefulness of information in grantee performance reports for EPA, grantees, and other users. We recommended, among other actions, that EPA incorporate expanded search capability features, such as keyword searches, into its proposed web- based portal for collecting and accessing performance reports to improve their accessibility."

    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "Domestic coal production has declined from about 1.2 billion tons in 2008 to about 728 million tons in 2016, according to EIA. Based on these projections, our moderate simulation shows that Trust Fund annual revenue may continue to decrease from about $298 million in fiscal year 2019 to about $197 million in fiscal year 2050 (see fig. 4). With the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease, our moderate case simulation suggests that expected revenue will likely be insufficient to cover combined black lung benefit payments and administrative costs, as well as debt repayment expenditures. Specifically, our moderate case simulation suggests that revenue may not be sufficient to cover beneficiary payments and administrative costs from fiscal years 2020 through 2050 (see fig. 5). For instance, in fiscal year 2029, simulated benefit payments and administrative costs will likely exceed simulated revenue by about $99 million. These annual deficits will likely decrease over time to about $4 million by fiscal year 2050 due, in part, to the assumed continued net decline in total black lung beneficiaries. Our simulation also therefore suggests that Trust Fund revenue may not be enough to also cover the debt repayment expenditures it must continue to make through fiscal year 2040, per the payment schedule established following the 2008 EIEA. Our moderate simulation suggests that the amount borrowed by the Trust Fund will likely increase from about $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2019 to about $15.4 billion in fiscal year 2050 (see fig. 6). Although the Trust Fund\u2019s legacy debt decreases through fiscal year 2040, total Trust Fund expenditures\u2014including combined benefit payments and administrative costs as well as debt repayments\u2014will likely continue to exceed revenue which will require continued annual borrowing from Treasury\u2019s general fund. However, the amount borrowed by the Trust Fund could vary depending, in part, on future coal production and the number of new beneficiaries and could range between about $6 billion and about $27 billion in 2050, according to our simulations (see appendix II)."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "Running away from home is not a recent phenomenon. Folkloric heroes Huckleberry Finn and Davy Crockett fled their abusive fathers to find adventure and employment. Although some youth today also leave home due to abuse and neglect, they often endure far more negative outcomes than their romanticized counterparts from an earlier era. Without adequate and safe shelter, runaway and homeless youth are vulnerable to engaging in high-risk behaviors and further victimization. Youth who live away from home for extended periods may become removed from school and systems of support. Runaway and homeless youth are vulnerable to multiple problems while they are away from a permanent home, including untreated mental health disorders, drug use, and sexual exploitation. They also report other challenges including poor health and the lack of basic provisions. Congress began to hear concerns about the vulnerabilities of the runaway population in the 1970s due to increased awareness about these youth and the establishment of runaway shelters to assist them in returning home. Congress and the President went on to enact the Runaway Youth Act of 1974 as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act ( P.L. 93-415 ) to assist runaways through services specifically for this population. Since that time, the law has been updated to authorize services to provide support for runaway and homeless youth outside of the juvenile justice, mental health, and child welfare systems. The Runaway Youth Act\u2014now known as the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act\u2014authorized federal funding to be provided through annual appropriations for three programs that assist runaway and homeless youth: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). Together, the programs make up the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP), administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF)."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "Although the number of sickness beneficiaries stayed relatively stable over time, the number of unemployment insurance beneficiaries increased significantly during and after the most recent economic recession from 2007 to 2009. Railroad unemployment and sickness benefits are financed solely by railroad employers' payroll taxes, based on the taxable earnings of their employees. Employers' tax rates depend on the past rates of unemployment and employees' sickness claims. For calendar year 2018, the employer tax rate ranges from 2.2% to 12.0% on the first $1,560 of each employee's monthly earnings. The payroll tax proceeds not needed immediately for unemployment and sickness insurance benefits or operating expenses are deposited in the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account maintained by the Treasury. This account, together with similar unemployment insurance accounts for each state, forms a Federal Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund whose deposits are invested in U.S. government securities, and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account receives interest based on these deposits. During FY2017, payroll tax contributions from railroad employers totaled $126.4 million and interest income was about $4 million. The RUIA provides for employers to pay a surcharge if the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account falls below an indexed threshold amount. The surcharge is added to the employer's tax rate. However, the total tax rate plus the surcharge cannot exceed the maximum rate of 12.0%, unless the surcharge is 3.5%, in which case the maximum tax rate is increased to 12.5%. From 2004 through 2010, the surcharge was 1.5%. The surcharge in 2011 was 2.5% and 1.5% in 2012 with no surcharges in 2013 or 2014. The surcharge in 2018 was 1.5%, the same as the level in the past three years. Eligibility for railroad unemployment and sickness benefits is based on recent railroad service and earnings. The annual benefit year begins on July 1. Eligibility is based on work in the prior year, or the base year."

      "While Congress required the State Department to expand the number of fellows participating in the Rangel and Pickering programs by 10 apiece pursuant to Section 706 of the Department of State Authorities Act, 2017 ( P.L. 114-323 ), it has provided the department the discretion to fund these programs at levels it deems appropriate from monies appropriated for Human Resources. P.L. 116-6 , like the House and Senate committee bills, continued to provide such discretion to the State Department. In addition, the House committee report indicated support for department efforts to increase diversity in hiring, including through the Rangel and Pickering programs. It also encouraged the Secretary of State to explore more opportunities to further the goal of increasing workforce diversity. The Senate committee report recommended the continued expansion of the department's workforce diversity programs and directed that qualified graduates of the Rangel and Pickering programs shall be inducted into the Foreign Service. While neither P.L. 116-6 nor the accompanying joint explanatory statement addressed the Rangel and Pickering programs specifically or Foreign Service diversity more generally, the joint explanatory statement did not negate any of the language in the House and Senate committee reports.

    "documentation": [
      "That interest, Justice Powell observed, was not only \"essential to the quality of higher education,\" but had also long \"been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment.\" Thus the \"right to select those students who will contribute the most to the robust exchange of ideas\" not only allowed a university \"to achieve a goal that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission,\" it also represented a \"countervailing constitutional interest\" that, in Justice Powell's view, called for the Court's respect. In Bakke , Justice Powell set out the basic theory for why diversity could justify an affirmative action policy, at least \"in the context of a university's admissions program. But he gave few details about what that interest encompassed. As he saw it, that interest must have its limits: pursuing diversity would not allow a university to resort to racial quotas, for example, nor could the school disregard other \"constitutional limitations protecting individual rights.\" But Justice Powell declined to indicate where those other limitations fell or how they circumscribed the goals a university could permissibly seek in the name of a diverse student body. And because the Bakke Court fractured as it did, with no one opinion commanding a majority of the Justices' votes, the lessons of that case have been hard to discern, especially after the Court appeared to decline a similar diversity rationale in later cases outside higher education. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the lower courts soon came to reflect this uncertain division of opinion in later cases involving affirmative action programs at other public universities. Some clarity over Bakke 's diversity theory came in 2003, with a pair of decisions reviewing affirmative action policies of the University of Michigan: Grutter v. Bollinger , challenging the university's law school admission program, and Gratz v. Bollinger , challenging the policy used by the university's undergraduate program. Grutter , especially, helped clarify what an interest in diversity involved, and how a university could rely on that interest to defend a race-conscious admissions policy."

Specifically, FRA and FHWA are coordinating with DOT\u2019s Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office to develop pilot technology that would enable crossing infrastructure or trains to communicate wirelessly with vehicles. Vehicles can use this information to warn the driver that a crash or violation is imminent, or integrate with onboard active safety systems. According to FRA officials, they completed a proof of concept in 2013 and completed and tested a prototype of the technology in 2017. DOT officials said that DOT does not have a time frame for when automakers might begin incorporating such connected vehicle technologies and noted that retrofitting older cars with new equipment will likely make this a long-term effort. FRA shares information on its research in various ways with state DOTs, because states are responsible for deciding which safety measures to install at grade crossings. Specifically, FRA and FHWA jointly hold quarterly webinars with stakeholders, including state DOT officials, and conduct presentations at highway-rail safety workshops. Information on safety measures such as grade-crossing devices, signs, and markings are also included in the Railroad-Highway Grade Crossing Handbook. According to DOT officials, the handbook was developed jointly by FHWA and FRA. The last version of the handbook was updated in 2007 and includes some out of date information. FRA and FHWA officials said they began working on an update in 2017, but missed the July 2018 target completion date. According to FHWA officials, updating the handbook is a complex undertaking that has taken more time than they anticipated due to the extensive collaboration required among stakeholders.

      "Health care practitioners prescribe opioid medications to treat pain and sometimes for other health problems, such as severe coughing. Opioid medications are available as immediate or extended release and in different forms, such as a pill, liquid, or a patch worn on the skin. Opioids slow down some processes of the body, such as breathing and heartbeat, by binding with certain receptors in the body. Over time, the body becomes tolerant to opioids, which means that larger doses of opioid medications are needed to achieve the same effect. People may use opioids in a manner other than as prescribed\u2014that is, they can be misused. Because opioids are highly addictive substances, they can pose serious risks when they are misused, which can lead to addiction and death. Symptoms of an opioid use disorder include a strong desire for opioids, the inability to control or reduce use, and continued use despite interference with major obligations or social functioning. Another concern associated with prescribed opioids is the potential for diversion for illegal purposes, such as nonmedical use or financial gain. Research has shown that MAT\u2014which combines behavioral therapy and the use of certain medications (methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone)\u2014can be more effective in reducing opioid use and increasing retention (i.e., reducing dropouts) compared to abstinence based treatment\u2014that is when patients are treated without medication. Three medications are currently approved by FDA for use in MAT for opioid use disorders\u2014methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Methadone: Methadone is a full opioid agonist, meaning it binds to and activates opioid receptors to help prevent withdrawal symptoms and reduce drug cravings. It has a long history of use for the treatment of opioid dependence in adults. Methadone suppresses withdrawal symptoms during detoxification therapy, which involves stabilizing patients who are addicted to opioids by withdrawing them in a controlled manner. Methadone also controls the craving for opioids during maintenance therapy, which is ongoing therapy meant to prevent relapse and increase treatment retention."

(Recommendation 2) The Secretary of the Army should assess existing Army policy for laboratory initiated research authority and determine whether to implement changes to eliminate disincentives for lab usage of the authority. (Recommendation 3) We provided a draft of this report to DOD, Energy, and NASA for review and comment."

    "question": "Considering the potential impact of scrubber adoption on fuel prices and the uncertainty surrounding future IMO regulations, what is the most likely scenario for the economic benefits of scrubber installation for vessel operators in the near future?",
    "choices": [
      "A) Scrubbers will always provide significant fuel cost savings because high-sulfur fuel will become increasingly expensive.",
      "B) The economic benefits of scrubbers will be maximized if a large number of vessels adopt them, leading to increased demand for low-sulfur fuel and higher prices.",
      "C) The economic benefits of scrubbers will be minimal because the initial investment cost will outweigh the potential savings, regardless of fuel price fluctuations.",
      "D) The economic benefits of scrubbers will depend on a complex interplay of factors, including the rate of scrubber adoption, future IMO regulations, and fuel supply and demand dynamics, making it difficult to predict with certainty."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "Therefore, while using a scrubber will allow a ship to continue using (currently) cheaper high-sulfur fuel, it may take years to recover the initial investment. For example, one industry study estimates that, in the case of a typical tanker, a scrubber installation could cost $4.2 million with a payback time of approximately 4.8 years. Furthermore, scrubbers installed to capture sulfur emissions might have to be further refitted or replaced to comply with any future IMO standards for GHG emissions. The rate of scrubber adoption could affect the financial impacts of installing them in terms of fuel costs. Scrubbers ultimately offset some or all of their initial costs because they allow vessel operators to continue using relatively inexpensive high-sulfur fuel. However, the return on investment for scrubbers depends on the relative prices of high- and low-sulfur bunker fuels. The demand\u2014and therefore, prices\u2014for low-sulfur and high-sulfur fuels will be affected by how many vessels use the respective fuels under the IMO standards that take effect in 2020. For example, limited scrubber adoption could result in more vessels demanding more low-sulfur fuel oil, creating upward pressure on low-sulfur fuel prices. Under such a scenario, scrubbers would provide greater fuel cost savings for vessels that installed them. Alternatively, high-sulfur fuel could become more costly due to refinery production cutbacks (because shippers will not be allowed to burn it without scrubbers). In this case, the economic benefits of scrubbers would be diminished. Given the uncertain fuel supply and demand dynamics, it is difficult for vessel operators to know how big the market distortions from scrubber installation could be or how many other operators may choose to install scrubbers. As of September 2018, there were approximately 660 ships retrofitted with scrubbers and over 600 ships under construction with plans to install scrubbers. By 2020, projecting additional construction orders, some analysts predict about 2,000 vessels could have scrubbers installed."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "Federal courts have also adopted broad interpretations of an NBA provision authorizing national banks to dismiss officers \"at pleasure.\" In Schweikert v. Bank of America , N.A. , the Fourth Circuit held that this provision preempted a state law claim for wrongful discharge brought by a former officer of a national bank. Similarly, the Ninth Circuit has held that this provision preempted a claim brought by a former officer of a national bank for breach of an employment agreement, reasoning that \"[a]n agreement which attempts to circumvent the complete discretion of a national bank's board of directors to terminate an officer at will is void as against [federal] public policy.\" Finally, in Wiersum v. U.S. Bank, N.A. , the Eleventh Circuit relied on Barnett Bank and the Fourth Circuit's reasoning in Schweikert to conclude that this \"at pleasure\" provision preempted a wrongful-termination claim brought by a former officer of a national bank under a state whistleblower statute. While federal courts have accordingly adopted expansive views of the circumstances in which state laws \"significantly interfere\" with national banks' powers, they have also recognized certain general limits on the preemptive scope of federal banking statutes and regulations. In Gutierrez v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA , for example, the Ninth Circuit held that federal banking regulations did not preempt a generally applicable state law prohibiting certain types of fraud. The Gutierrez litigation involved a national bank's use of a bookkeeping method known as \"high-to-low\" posting for debit-card transactions, whereby the bank posted large transactions to customers' accounts before small transactions. In Gutierrez , customers of the bank brought a variety of state law claims based on the theory that the bank adopted high-to-low posting for the sole purpose of maximizing the overdraft fees it could charge customers. In response, the bank argued that OCC regulations preempted the state law claims. The Ninth Circuit held that the OCC regulations preempted some, but not all, of the customers' claims."

      "While we generally received too few responses from charter school districts to report their data separately, we are able to estimate that about 36 percent of charter school districts tested for lead in school drinking water. To learn more about experiences of charter schools, we visited one charter school district and interviewed representatives of the DC Public Charter School Board (DC PCSB). The charter school district we visited consisted of one charter school in a building it leased. The school had 10 sources of consumable water, all of which were tested in 2016 and were found to have lead below the district\u2019s selected action level of 15 parts per billion. Before testing, district officials met with the building owner who agreed to cover the cost of any remediation. Officials with the DC PCSB told us that it paid to have tests conducted in every charter school in the District of Columbia. According to DC PCSB officials, between March and June 2016, 95 charter schools were tested, and lead above their action level of 15 parts per billion was discovered in 20 schools. Officials estimated their testing costs to be about $100,000, which was subsequently reimbursed by the District of Columbia\u2019s Office of State Superintendent of Education. They also said that charter schools were responsible for taking steps to remediate the lead and recommended schools flush their water systems and use filters.

      "Fish and Wildlife also updated its guidance to grant awarding offices instructing them to perform a potential overlap and duplication review of all selected applicants prior to award. Our Action Tracker provides details on the status of actions from our annual reports. Within the 133 crosscutting areas, since 2011 we have identified 315 targeted actions where opportunities exist to better manage fragmentation, overlap, and duplication, including 29 new actions in our most recent report issued in April 2017. We found that the executive branch and Congress addressed 145 (46 percent) of the 315 actions. For example, in November 2014, we recommended that the U.S. Coast Guard and Consumer Product Safety Commission establish a formal approach to coordination (such as a memorandum of understanding) to facilitate information sharing; better leverage their resources; and address challenges, including those related to fragmentation and overlap that we identified. In response to this recommendation, the two agencies signed a formal policy document to govern their coordination in May 2015. This policy document outlined procedures for determining jurisdictional authority for recreational boat-associated equipment and marine safety items. Specifically, the procedures clarified that upon receiving notice of a possible defect, the agency receiving such notice shall determine whether the item properly falls within its jurisdiction, and if not, initiate discussions to determine the appropriate jurisdiction. These new procedures should help the agencies share information and leverage each other\u2019s resources so they can better ensure that recreational boat-associated equipment and marine safety items are fully regulated. However, more work is needed on the remaining 170 actions (54 percent) that have not been fully addressed.

    "documentation": [
      "The CUES agreement in effect supplements the 1972 COLREGs Convention (see previous section); it does not cancel or lessen commitments that countries have as parties to the COLREGS Convention. Two observers stated that \"the [CUES] resolution is non-binding; only regulates communication in 'unplanned encounters,' not behavior; fails to address incidents in territorial waters; and does not apply to fishing and maritime constabulary vessels [i.e., coast guard ships and other maritime law enforcement ships], which are responsible for the majority of Chinese harassment operations.\" DOD stated in 2015 that Going forward, the Department is also exploring options to expand the use of CUES to include regional law enforcement vessels and Coast Guards. Given the growing use of maritime law enforcement vessels to enforce disputed maritime claims, expansion of CUES to MLE [maritime law enforcement] vessels would be an important step in reducing the risk of unintentional conflict. U.S. Navy officials have stated that the CUES agreement is generally working well, and that the United States (as noted in the passage above) is interested in expanding the agreement to cover coast guard ships. Officials from Singapore and Malaysia reportedly have expressed support for the idea.

      "D) DSTs create significant economic distortions by favoring larger multinational corporations while potentially harming smaller businesses and consumers through higher prices or reduced service availability."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "If one of those companies sells luxury cars and another sells consumer household goods, the DST has more progressive effects in the former case and more regressive effects in the latter. In the aggregate, though, there is little reason to assume that final consumers of goods and services sold through taxable activities in digitized business models are disproportionately higher-income. Thus, it can be expected that a DST affecting a broad range of goods and services is more likely to be regressive than not, especially when compared to a tax on corporate profits. DSTs create unequal economic treatment between similarly situated firms inside and outside of the digital economy. Firms outside of the digital economy can earn just as much global or local revenue as firms taxed under DSTs without being subject to an additional layer of tax on their revenue. Firms outside or inside the digital economy can also engage in profit shifting and \"aggressive\" transfer pricing to reduce their taxes owed in a country. DSTs, as they have been presented thus far, also create inequalities for firms of similar size based on certain exemptions and thresholds. For example, each of the specific European DST proposals use different or multiple thresholds based on total cross-border profits, revenue generated from covered business activities, \"clicks\" or interaction based from local users, etc. While proponents of these DSTs with minimum thresholds might have other policy goals in mind (e.g., exempting smaller businesses from potentially costly tax compliance burdens), the exact levels at which these thresholds are drawn among larger MNCs are arbitrary from a policy perspective. Critics of DSTs would argue that the thresholds are drawn to exclude domestic MNCs or to target the taxes to a narrow set of foreign MNCs. Regardless of their rationale, these thresholds create concerns of inequitable treatment between different sectors. In the situation where the tax is fully passed along to consumers, digital firms either charge a higher price (reducing demand) or exit the industry."

    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "Still other opponents might argue that providing additional authority to sureties to approve and monitor bonds could increase the risk of defaults and program losses. Throughout the program's history, both congressional testimony and GAO examinations have indicated that smaller contracting firms, and especially minority-owned and women-owned small business contracting firms, often have a more difficult time accessing surety bonds in the private marketplace than larger firms. For example, in 1995, GAO reported that \"it is not unusual for a small construction company to have some difficulty in obtaining a surety bond.\" GAO found that about one in three of the smallest contracting firms it surveyed, compared with about one in six of the larger contracting firms it surveyed, reported that they were required to provide collateral. GAO also reported The experiences of the minority-owned firms differed from those of the firms not owned by minorities in several areas. For example, these firms were more likely to be asked to provide certain types of financial documentation, as well as to provide collateral or to meet other conditions; were more likely to be denied a bond and to report losing an opportunity to bid because of delays in processing their request for a bond; and were more likely to depend on jobs requiring bonds for a higher proportion of their revenues. The women-owned firms differed from the firms not owned by women in a few key respects. For example, they \u2026 were more likely to be asked to provide more types of financial or other documentation to obtain a bond. In addition, the minority-owned firms reported more often than the firms not owned by minorities that they had to (1) establish an escrow account controlled by the surety company, (2) hire a CPA or a management or consulting firm selected by the surety company to manage the contract, and (3) enter into an arrangement that allows the surety company to manage the job even when the firm is not in default. Although congressional testimony and GAO examinations have supported the need for a program such as the SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program, that testimony and GAO's surveys of businesses have been somewhat less useful in helping Congress determine the appropriate size for the program."

During 2014, the United States joined Saudi Arabia in demanding that Houthi forces reverse their campaign to occupy the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, but the rapid onset of hostilities in March 2015 forced the Obama Administration to react quickly. At the start of the Saudi-led intervention on March 25, 2015, the Administration announced that the United States would provide \"logistical and intelligence support\" to the coalition's operations without taking \"direct military action in Yemen in support of this effort.\" Soon thereafter, a joint U.S.-Saudi planning cell was established to coordinate military and intelligence support for the campaign. At the United Nations Security Council, the United States supported the passage of Resolution 2216 (April 2015), which, among other things, required member states to impose an arms embargo against the Houthi-Saleh forces and demanded that the Houthis withdraw from all areas seized during the current conflict. Since the March 2015 Saudi-led coalition intervention in Yemen, Congress has taken an active role in debating and overseeing U.S. policy in the Arabian Peninsula. Members have considered legislative proposals seeking to reduce Yemeni civilian casualties resulting from the coalition's operations; improve deteriorating humanitarian conditions; end restrictions on the flow of goods and humanitarian aid; combat Iranian support for the Houthis; preserve maritime security in the Bab al Mandab Strait; and/or support continued Saudi-led coalition and U.S. efforts to counter Al Qaeda and Islamic State forces in Yemen.

      "These activities would be hampered without the identification numbers. For example, Iowa and Texas regulations do not require producers to register all of their animals with the state. Also, record keeping varies at individual farms and ranches, where some producers have electronic records, but others have no written records or rely on hand-written paper documents, according to USDA documents. Searching through records by hand at individual farms could take days rather than the hours that it would take if the records were electronic, according to a USDA planning document. Without timely and accurate tracing through the use of premises and animal identification numbers, USDA may face challenges controlling and containing an FMD outbreak and facilitating continuity of commerce in uninfected animals. In addition, some animals have identification numbers on ear tags that must be read visually, which could slow USDA\u2019s efforts to control and contain an outbreak. In an outbreak, responders would need to inspect animals with such ear tags to manually read and record the identification numbers for individual animals. In contrast, for animals with electronic tags, responders could use electronic readers, which can accurately read identification numbers for a group of animals from a distance of up to 12 feet, according to a 2016 USDA study on electronic identification for livestock. One industry representative said that the beef cattle industry has not widely implemented electronic identification because it is difficult for many operators to justify the added cost of purchasing and attaching an electronic tag for each animal. In an FMD outbreak, USDA would likely face biosecurity challenges including lack of sufficient biosecurity on some premises, difficulty in implementing biosecurity measures for certain species, and lack of documentation (such as a written plan) specifying what measures are currently in place. A majority (20 of 29) of respondents to our questionnaire indicated that USDA would face significant challenges in this area."

We made three recommendations, with which the Navy agreed to take steps to improve its management of capital investment in the shipyards. However, we noted that at current average funding levels it would take at least 19 years and a Navy-estimated $4.86 billion to clear the backlog of restoration and modernization projects at the shipyards. Furthermore, this estimate does not include the $9 billion that the Navy estimates it will need for capacity and capability upgrades over the next 12 years to support maintenance operations for the current fleet. In September 2016, we found that although DOD has stated that readiness rebuilding is a priority, implementation and oversight of department-wide readiness rebuilding efforts did not fully include key elements of sound planning, and the lack of these elements puts the overall rebuilding efforts at risk.

The Navy identified carrier strike groups and amphibious ready groups as key force elements in its plan for readiness recovery and had set 2020 for reaching a predictable and sustainable level of global presence and surge capacity by implementing the optimized fleet response plan. However, we found in 2016 that the Navy faced significant challenges, such as delays in completing maintenance and emerging demands, in achieving its readiness recovery goals for carrier strike groups and amphibious ready groups, and projections show that the Navy will not meet its time frames for achieving readiness recovery. As a result, we recommended that DOD and the services establish comprehensive readiness goals, strategies for implementing them, and associated metrics that can be used to evaluate whether readiness recovery efforts are achieving intended outcomes."

    "question": "What was the primary factor contributing to CSPF's inability to meet its funding target by the end of 2009?",
    "choices": [
      "A) The 2008 market downturn significantly reduced CSPF's assets, and the subsequent market rebound in 2009 was insufficient to recoup those losses.",
      "B) The withdrawal of UPS in 2007, which resulted in a $6.1 billion withdrawal liability payment, negatively impacted CSPF's investment returns.",
      "C) CSPF's investment return over the period from 2000 to 2009 was significantly lower than the assumed rate of return used in the plan's projections.",
      "D) A combination of investment losses, exceeding benefits and expenses, and a decline in contributions led to CSPF having less than $20 billion in assets available for investment returns by the end of 2009."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "While the plan used an assumed rate of return of 7.5 to 8.0 percent per year between 2000 and 2014, our analysis of the plan\u2019s regulatory filings shows that the plan\u2019s weighted-average investment return over this period was about 4.9 percent per year. CSPF officials said the 2008 downturn significantly reduced CSPF\u2019s assets and it was unable to sufficiently recoup those losses when the market rebounded in 2009. Plan assets declined from $26.8 billion at the beginning of 2008 to $17.4 billion at the beginning of 2009, with $7.5 billion of the decline attributable to investment losses. Despite reporting a 26 percent return on assets during 2009, CSPF had only $19.5 billion in assets at the end of 2009 because benefits and expenses exceeded the contributions it collected and because it had fewer assets generating returns for the plan. By the end of 2009, CSPF\u2019s funding target was $35.9 billion but the fund had less than $20 billion that could be used to generate investment returns. If CSPF\u2019s portfolio had returned 7.5 percent per year over the 2000-2014 period, instead of the approximately 4.9 percent we calculated, we estimate that the portfolio value would have exceeded $32.0 billion at the end of 2014, or 91 percent of its Actuarial Accrued Liability. In addition to the factors mentioned that affected many multiemployer plans, stakeholders we interviewed also noted the unique effect of the UPS withdrawal on CSPF. In 2007, UPS negotiated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for a withdrawal from CSPF and paid a withdrawal liability payment of $6.1 billion. This payment was invested just prior to the 2008 market downturn. Moreover, the loss of UPS, CSPF\u2019s largest contributing employer, reduced the plan\u2019s ability to collect needed contributions if the plan became more underfunded. A UPS official said that, following the market decline of 2001-2002, the company considered whether it should withdraw from all multiemployer plans because it did not want to be the sole contributing employer in any plan."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "For FY2000, Congress included explicit report language concerning the local match. The conferees agree that the $331,650,000 provided to communities or other entities for construction of water and wastewater treatment facilities and for groundwater protection infrastructure shall be accompanied by a cost-share requirement whereby 45 percent of a project's cost is to be the responsibility of the community or entity consistent with long-standing guidelines for the Agency. These guidelines also offer flexibility in the application of the cost-share requirement for those few circumstances when meeting the 45 percent requirement is not possible. Similar report language concerning local cost-share requirements accompanied the conference reports on the appropriations bills from FY2001 through FY2005. Beginning with FY2004, Congress specified in the appropriations legislation that the local share of project costs shall be not less than 45%. Similarly, beginning with the FY2003 appropriations legislation, Congress also specified that, except for those limited instances in which an applicant meets the criteria for a waiver of the cost-share requirement, the earmarked grant shall provide no more than 55% of an individual project's cost, regardless of the amount appropriated. The practice of earmarking special project water infrastructure grants continued to change. First, in FY2007, Congress applied a one-year moratorium on earmarks in all appropriations bills. For the next three years, special project grants were allowed in appropriations bills\u2014including EPA's\u2014but again in FY2011, no special project funding was provided for congressional projects. Following the 2010 midterm election and during subsequent months while FY2011 appropriations were under consideration (discussed below), the general issue of congressional earmarks of specific projects had become highly controversial because of the overall growing number of them, concern over the influence of special interests on spending decisions, and lack of congressional oversight."

      "In any cases where there was a disagreement, the analysts discussed any discrepancies. If they were not resolved, a third analyst reviewed the assessments. To assess the extent to which there may be additional opportunities for facility consolidations, we obtained DLA Document Services data on revenue reported by each facility, which DOD Document Services officials told us they used in determining which facilities to consolidate as a part of their transformation plan. We analyzed the share of mission specialty revenue reported by facilities that (1) were retained by DLA Document Services for a given mission specialty, (2) were retained but not for a given specialty, and (3) were not retained. We further divided those facilities retained for a given specialty into quartiles to better understand the concentration of revenue in those facilities. To assess the reliability of these data, we interviewed DLA Documents Services officials regarding how the data were gathered, analyzed, reported, and used. We found that these data were reliable for the purpose of analyzing the shares of mission specialty revenue represented by each facility or group of facilities. To compare the cost of print devices offered by DLA Document Services, the Army, and the Air Force, we gathered and analyzed data on the monthly cost of multifunction devices with comparable specifications. We compared costs for similar devices based on device specifications including print speeds, monthly volumes, and paper capacities. Because Army and Air Force costs are estimated and there might be other differences in device specifications, approaches to obtaining devices, and which associated services were included, this analysis does not allow us to conclude which sources provide the greatest value. However, it illustrates differences in the cost of print devices across sources. For DLA Document Services, we used DLA Document Services\u2019 standard monthly pricing for 2018 for various categories of multifunction devices. For the Army, Army officials were unable to provide data on the cost of multifunction devices purchased by Army customers."

Kentucky state CPS officials told us that the local organizations and service providers that they collaborate with to develop the plan of safe care also vary based on the family\u2019s needs. For example, Kentucky will only collaborate with substance use treatment providers to develop the plan of safe care when families have substance use disorders. Similarly, during our site visits, officials from two states told us that the decision to place an infant in foster care is based on the individualized needs of the infant and caregiver. For example, Massachusetts state officials told us that their decision to remove a baby from the home depends on a myriad of factors and is determined on a case-by-case basis. Officials explained that if a mother is discharged from the hospital and begins using drugs again and does not have adequate supports in place to care for her baby, CPS may decide to place the infant in foster care. However, if a mother has existing support systems in place to mitigate safety risks, CPS may decide to keep the baby in the home. In our survey, all 51 states reported that their agencies either always or sometimes refer parents or caregivers to substance use treatment programs, and most states reported that they always or sometimes refer parents or caregivers to parenting classes or programs (49), and other supportive services (49). CPS officials in each of the three states that we visited told us that their plans of safe care include referrals to address not only the immediate needs of the infants, but also the needs of the parent or caregiver. For example, officials from a local Kentucky CPS agency told us that staff refer mothers of substance-exposed infants to a program called Sobriety Treatment and Recovery Team (START)."

DHS officials also stated that IBC did not consistently update the IMS to ensure that it accurately reflected all required tasks, the completion status, and the resources required to complete them. Concerns related to meeting milestones and updating the IMS were discussed during periodic status update meetings that included DHS, IBC, OMB, FIT, and USSM officials.

      "Primary Airports. The apportionment for airports that board more than 10,000 passengers each year is based on the number of boardings (also referred to as enplanements) during the prior calendar year. The amount apportioned for each fiscal year is equal to double the amount that would be received according to the following formulas: $7.80 for each of the first 50,000 passenger boardings; $5.20 for each of the next 50,000 passenger boardings; $2.60 for each of the next 400,000 passenger boardings; $0.65 for each of the next 500,000 passenger boardings; and $0.50 for each passenger boarding in excess of 1 million. The minimum allocation to any primary airport is $1 million. The maximum is $26 million. Cargo Service Airports. Some 3.5% of AIP funds subject to apportionment are apportioned to airports served by all-cargo aircraft with a total annual landed weight of more than 100 million pounds. The allocation formula is the proportion of the individual airport's landed weight to the total landed weight at all cargo service airports. General Aviation Airports. General aviation, reliever, and nonprimary commercial service airports are apportioned 20% of AIP funds subject to apportionment. From this share, all airports, excluding all nonreliever primary airports, receive the lesser of the following: $150,000; or one-fifth of the estimated five-year costs for airport development for each of these airports as listed in the most recent NPIAS. Any remaining funds are distributed according to a state-based population and area formula. FAA makes the project decisions on the use of these funds in consultation with the states. Although FAA has ultimate control, some states view these funds as an opportunity to address general aviation needs from a statewide, rather than a local or national, perspective.

      "D) The firm relies on consumer perception of value, creating artificial differences in product quality to justify higher prices for certain segments."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A)",
    "documentation": [
      "Many consumer products\u2014such as deodorants, shaving products, and hair care products\u2014are differentiated to appeal specifically to men or women through differences in packaging, scent, or other product characteristics (see fig. 1). These differences related to gender can affect manufacturing and marketing costs that may contribute to price differences in products targeted to different genders. However, firms may also charge consumers different prices for the same (or very similar) goods and services even when there are no differences in costs to produce. To maximize profits, firms use a variety of techniques to charge prices close to the highest price different consumers are willing to pay. Firms may attempt to get segments of the consumer market to pay a higher price than another segment by slightly altering or differentiating the product. Based on the differentiated products, consumers self-select into different groups according to their preferences and what they are willing to pay. For example, some consumer goods have different versions of what is essentially the same product\u2014except for differences in packaging or features, such as scent\u2014with one version intended for women and another version intended for men. The two products may be priced differently because the firm expects that one gender will be willing to pay more for the product than the other based on preference for certain product attributes. Firms may also use some group characteristic, such as age or gender, to charge different prices because some groups may have differences in willingness or ability to pay. For example, a firm may offer discounted movie tickets to students or seniors, as they may have less disposable income. For the seller the cost of providing the movie is the same for any customer, but the seller is able to maximize its profits by offering tickets to different groups of customers at different prices. A firm\u2019s ability to differentiate prices depends on multiple factors, such as the firm\u2019s market power (so that competitors cannot put downward pressure on prices to eliminate the price differences), the presence of consumer segments with different demands and willingness to pay, and control over the sale of its product so it cannot be easily resold to exploit price differences."

Somalia lacks effective national governance and maintains an informal economy largely based on livestock, money transfer companies, and telecommunications. In the absence of a formal banking sector, money transfer companies have sprung up throughout the country, handling up to $1.6 billion in remittances annually. According to a 2016 State report, Somalia remained a safe haven for terrorists who used their relative freedom of movement to obtain resources and funds, recruit fighters, and plan and mount operations within Somalia and neighboring countries. The United States maintains a targeted list-based Somalia sanctions program. Organizations providing humanitarian assistance may apply for a specific license to engage in transactions that otherwise would be prohibited by the Somalia sanctions regulations. The United States has provided approximately $1.2 billion in humanitarian assistance for Somalia since 2012. Haiti. Currently the poorest country in the western hemisphere, Haiti has experienced political instability for most of its history. Remittances are the primary source of foreign exchange, equivalent to more than a quarter of GDP, and nearly double the combined value of Haitian exports and foreign direct investment. In January 2010, a catastrophic earthquake killed an estimated 300,000 people and left close to 1.5 million people homeless. Hurricane Matthew, the fiercest Caribbean storm in nearly a decade, made landfall in Haiti on October 4, 2016, creating a new humanitarian emergency.

      "Most recently, on May 15, 2018, the President signed Executive Order 13833, Enhancing the Effectiveness of Agency Chief Information Officers. Among other things, this executive order is intended to better position agencies to modernize their IT systems, execute IT programs more efficiently, and reduce cybersecurity risks. The order pertains to 22 of the 24 Chief Financial Officer Act agencies: the Department of Defense and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are exempt. For the covered agencies, the executive order strengthens the role of agency CIOs by, among other things, requiring to report directly to their agency head; to serve as their agency head\u2019s primary IT strategic advisor; and to have a significant role in all management, governance, and oversight processes related to IT. In addition, one of the cybersecurity requirements directs agencies to ensure that the CIO works closely with an integrated team of senior executives, including those with expertise in IT, security, and privacy, to implement appropriate risk management measures. In the February 2017 update to our high-risk series, we reported that agencies still needed to complete significant work related to the management of IT acquisitions and operations We stressed that OMB and federal agencies should continue to expeditiously implement FITARA and OMB\u2019s related guidance, which include enhancing CIO authority, consolidating data centers, and acquiring and managing software licenses. Our update to this high-risk area also stressed that OMB and agencies needed to continue to implement our prior recommendations in order to improve their ability to effectively and efficiently invest in IT. Specifically, from fiscal years 2010 through 2015, we made 803 recommendations to OMB and federal agencies to address shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations. In addition, in fiscal year 2016, we made 202 new recommendations, thus, further reinforcing the need for OMB and agencies to address the shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations."

    "question": "What was the primary shift in the approach to funding war-related activities between the Bush and Obama Administrations?",

      "B) The Obama Administration sought to exempt war-related funding from budget caps, while the Bush Administration did not.",
      "C) The Obama Administration began using regular budget processes to fund war-related activities, moving away from supplemental requests.",
      "D) The Obama Administration used the term \"Global War on Terror\" to describe war-related funding, while the Bush Administration used \"Overseas Contingency Operations.\""

      "By comparison, during the conflict in Vietnam\u2014the only other to last more than a decade\u2014DOD funding designated for non-base activities averaged 6% of the department's total budget authority. Supplemental appropriations can provide flexibility for policymakers to address demands that arise after funding has been appropriated. However, that flexibility has caused some to question whether supplementals should only be used to respond to unforeseen events, or whether they should also provide funding for activities that could reasonably be covered in regular appropriations acts. Congress used supplemental appropriations to provide funds for defense and foreign affairs activities related to operations in Afghanistan and Iraq following 9/11, and each subsequent fiscal year through FY2010. Initially understood as reflecting needs that were not anticipated during the regular appropriations cycle, supplemental appropriations were generally enacted as requested, and almost always designated as emergency requirements. Beginning in FY2004, DOD received some of its war-related funding in its regular annual appropriations; these funds were designated as emergency. When funding needs for war and non-war-related activities were higher than anticipated, the Bush Administration submitted supplemental requests. In the FY2011 appropriations cycle, the Obama Administration moved away from submitting supplemental appropriations requests to Congress for war-related activities and used the regular budget and appropriation process to fund operations. This approach implied that while the funds might be war-related, they largely supported predictable ongoing activities rather than unanticipated needs. In concert with this change in budgetary approach, the Obama Administration began formally using the term Overseas Contingency Op erations in place of the Bush Administration's term Global War on Terror . Both the Obama and Trump Administrations requested that OCO funding be designated in a manner that would effectively exempt such funding from the BCA limits on discretionary defense spending."
