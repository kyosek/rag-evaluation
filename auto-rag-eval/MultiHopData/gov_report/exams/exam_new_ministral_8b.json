      "In addition to our site visits, we selected 12 additional stakeholders that included health care providers or administrators in non-hospital settings across the United States; officials from medical specialty societies; and experts. Specifically, we spoke with (1) health care providers (including physicians or nurses) or administrators from four non-hospital settings in Arizona, Ohio, Washington, and West Virginia, which were selected based on recommendations from stakeholders we interviewed and on the availability of such settings and their experience treating NAS; (2) health care providers from five medical specialty societies, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, MedNAX (a network of physicians that specialize in neonatal care, including NAS treatment), and the National Association of Neonatal Nurses; and (3) three experts, including the authors of published literature we reviewed. We interviewed each of these 32 stakeholders and requested information from stakeholders about treating infants with NAS, including the utilization of available hospital and non-hospital care settings and associated costs of treatment services. For example, we requested protocols for screening and treating infants with NAS from hospital and non-hospital care settings. We reviewed available protocols provided by hospitals and a non-hospital care setting. We also reviewed available information reported by state officials, hospital and non-hospital providers, and state perinatal collaboratives on the utilization of hospital and non-hospital care settings, the facilities\u2019 cost of treating NAS in hospital and non-hospital settings, the lengths of stay for treating infants with NAS, or the amount of Medicaid payments for treating infants with NAS. We discussed the information provided by stakeholders and examined the information for obvious errors. The information obtained from these stakeholders is not generalizable to other states or other hospital and non-hospital settings.",
      "Figure 2 depicts nursery rooms in the neonatal withdrawal center in West Virginia. Efforts are also underway to open a neonatal withdrawal center in Arizona and Ohio, according to stakeholders we interviewed. Stakeholders we interviewed and the literature we reviewed suggest some limitations as well as benefits of treating infants with NAS in non- hospital settings, including factors to consider in these settings. Health care providers from one of the hospitals we visited in Vermont told us that their hospital is the only one in the state that allows infants with NAS to complete pharmacologic treatment through the Vermont outpatient clinic because they have established the necessary infrastructure to ensure families\u2019 compliance and safe practices at home. These providers said that they worked with one local pharmacy to ensure proper dispensing of the medication. Additionally, these providers measured the amount of medication left over at each follow- up visit with the families. Some state and perinatal collaborative officials told us that neonatal withdrawal centers may not be the best environment to treat infants with NAS because these settings may limit a mother\u2019s access to her infant, since she may not always be allowed to reside with the infant. Such limits, according to officials, do not facilitate bonding between mother and infant. Another state perinatal collaborative official, as well as health care providers and staff, told us that neonatal withdrawal centers may be better for treating infants with NAS because the environment is quieter and less stimulating than hospital settings, such as NICUs. Several studies we reviewed also emphasized that the inpatient-to- outpatient approach requires ongoing coordination, communication, and commitment from multidisciplinary providers, as well as the families. These studies highlighted instances in which these approaches reduced the length of the infants\u2019 stay in a hospital, though the studies emphasized that more work needs to be done to determine whether these are the optimal approaches for infants with NAS, as well as the potential long-term benefits of such approaches."

      "C) The executive order automatically lowered the Member pay adjustment rate to 1.0%.",
      "D) The executive order increased the GS base pay by 0.5%, which automatically lowered the Member pay adjustment rate to 0.5%."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "The executive order included a 0.5% increase for GS base pay, which automatically lowered the maximum potential Member pay adjustment from 1.1% to 0.5%. As in prior years, schedule 6 of the 2012 executive order listed the pay rate for Members of Congress for the upcoming year. This executive order indicated that an annual adjustment would take effect after the expiration of the freeze included in P.L. 112-175 . As stated above, the annual adjustments take effect automatically if legislation is not enacted preventing them. The executive order, however, by establishing the GS pay adjustment at a lower rate than the scheduled Member pay adjustment, automatically lowered the Member pay adjustment rate since by law Member pay adjustments cannot be higher than GS pay adjustments. Subsequently, a provision in H.R. 8 , the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was enacted on January 2, 2013 ( P.L. 112-240 ), froze Member pay at the 2009 level for 2013. The language was included in S.Amdt. 3448 , a substitute amendment agreed to by unanimous consent. The bill, as amended, passed the Senate (89-8, vote #251) and the House (257-167, roll call #659) on January 1, 2013. This freeze was subsequently reflected in Executive Order 13641, which was signed April 5, 2013. This represented the second time, the first being in 2006, that Member pay was statutorily frozen for only a portion of the following year at the time of the issuance of the executive order. In both instances, the executive order listed new pay rates and indicated an effective date following the expiration of the statutory freeze. Pay adjustments in both years were further frozen pursuant to subsequent laws. As stated above, projected Member pay adjustments are calculated based on changes in the ECI. The projected 2011 adjustment of 0.9% was known when the BLS released data for the ECI change during the 12-month period from December 2008 to December 2009 on January 29, 2010. This adjustment would have equaled a $1,600 increase, resulting in a salary of $175,600.",
      "The President issued an alternate pay plan for civilian federal employees on August 30, 2013. This plan called for a January 2014 across-the-board pay increase of 1.0% for federal civilian employees, the same percentage as proposed in the President's FY2014 budget. Legislation was not enacted to prohibit or alter the GS adjustment, and Executive Order 13655, issued on December 23, 2013, implemented a 1.0% increase for GS employees. Had the Member pay adjustment not been prohibited by law, the GS base pay adjustment would have automatically limited a salary adjustment for Members of Congress to 1.0% ($1,700). The maximum potential 2013 pay adjustment of 1.1%, or $1,900, was known when the BLS released data for the change in the ECI during the 12-month period from December 2010 to December 2011 on January 31, 2012. The adjustment takes effect automatically unless (1) denied statutorily by Congress or (2) limited by the GS base pay adjustment, since the percentage increase in Member pay is limited by law to the GS base pay percentage increase. The President's budget, submitted on February 13, 2012, proposed an average (i.e., base and locality) 0.5% adjustment for GS employees. President Obama later stated in a letter to congressional leadership on August 21, 2012, that the current federal pay freeze should extend until FY2013 budget negotiations are finalized. Section 114 of H.J.Res. 117 , the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013, which was introduced on September 10, 2012, extended the freeze enacted by P.L. 111-322 through the duration of this continuing resolution. H.J.Res. 117 was passed by the House on September 13 and the Senate on September 22. It was signed by the President on September 28, 2012 ( P.L. 112-175 ). A delay in the implementation of pay adjustments for GS employees automatically delays any scheduled Member pay adjustment. On December 27, 2012, President Obama issued Executive Order 13635, which listed the rates of pay for various categories of officers and employees that would be effective after the expiration of the freeze extended by P.L. 112-175 ."

      "D) The regulatory authority is required to approve a permit for a coal mine only if the operator provides sufficient financial assurances to cover all anticipated costs, including long-term water pollution."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "SMCRA allows an individual state or Indian tribe to develop its own program to implement the act if the Secretary of the Interior finds that the program is in accordance with federal law. A state with an approved program is said to have \u201cprimacy\u201d for that program. To obtain primacy, a state or Indian tribe submits to the Secretary of the Interior for approval a program that demonstrates that the state or tribe has the capability of carrying out the requirements of SMCRA. The program must demonstrate that the state or Indian tribe has, among other things, a law that provides for the regulation of the surface effects of coal mining and reclamation in accordance with the requirements of SMCRA, and a regulatory authority with sufficient personnel and funding to do so. Of the 25 states and four Indian tribes that OSMRE identified as having active coal mining in 2017, 23 states had primacy, and OSMRE manages the coal program in 2 states and for the four Indian tribes. SMCRA requires a mine operator to obtain a permit before starting to mine. The permit process requires operators to submit plans describing the extent of proposed mining operations and how and on what timeline the mine sites will be reclaimed. In general, an operator must reclaim the land to a use it was capable of supporting before mining or to an alternative postmining land use that OSMRE or the state regulatory authority deems higher or better than the premining land use. In reclaiming the mine site, operators must comply with regulatory standards that govern, among other things, how the reclaimed area is regraded, replanting of the site, and the quality of water flowing from the site. Specifically: Operators are generally required to return mine sites to their approximate original contour unless the operator receives a variance from the regulatory authority. To return to this contour, the surface configuration achieved by backfilling and grading of the mined area must closely resemble the general surface configuration of the land before mining and blend into and complement the drainage pattern of the surrounding terrain, with all highwalls and spoil piles eliminated.",
      "Under SMCRA, OSMRE is required to evaluate each primacy state\u2019s coal program annually to ensure that it complies with SMCRA. SMCRA includes a requirement that the regulatory authority secure necessary financial assurances to assure the reclamation of each permitted mine site. While OSMRE\u2019s directive on oversight of state and tribal regulatory programs does not instruct the agency to review state regulatory authority calculations of financial assurance amounts, it instructs OSMRE to focus on the state programs\u2019 success in achieving the overall purposes of SMCRA. For example, OSMRE, in conducting its oversight, is to evaluate the states\u2019 effectiveness in successfully reclaiming lands affected by mining and in avoiding negative effects outside of areas authorized for mining activities. If OSMRE\u2019s review of a state program identifies an issue that could result in the state not effectively implementing, administering, enforcing, or maintaining all or any portion of its approved coal program, OSMRE can work with the state regulatory authority to develop an action plan to correct the issue. If a state regulatory authority does not take the necessary corrective action, OSMRE may begin the process of withdrawing approval for a part or all of the state\u2019s primacy. In addition to annually evaluating state programs, OSMRE can conduct national or regional reviews on specific topics. For example, OSMRE conducted a national review in 2010 that examined how state regulatory authorities calculated the required amount of financial assurances for coal mine reclamation. The review examined financial assurance practices in 23 states and reported that on the basis of the sample of mining permits reviewed, OSMRE was unable to determine if the amount of financial assurances was adequate for at least one of the permits it reviewed in 10 of the 23 states. Among the potential issues OSMRE identified were errors in the methods state regulatory authorities used to calculate financial assurance amounts and insufficient information in the reclamation plan upon which to calculate reclamation costs.",
      "Operators are required to demonstrate successful revegetation of the mine site for 5 years (in locations that receive more than 26 inches of rain annually) or 10 years (in drier areas). States have requirements for what vegetation may be planted depending on the approved postmining land use. For example, West Virginia\u2019s regulations call for sites with a postmining land use of forest land to be planted with at least 500 woody plants per acre. The state specifies that at least five species of trees be used, including at least three of the species being higher value hardwoods, such as oak, ash, or maple. SMCRA requires that financial assurances be sufficient to ensure reclamation compliant with water quality standards, including those established by the Environmental Protection Agency or the states under the Clean Water Act. SMCRA\u2019s implementing regulations also contain additional water protection requirements. For example, the regulations require that all surface mining and reclamation activities be conducted to minimize disturbance of the hydrologic balance within the permit and adjacent areas and to prevent material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area. The federal government also enacted SMCRA, in part, to implement an abandoned mine land program to promote the reclamation of mined areas left without adequate reclamation prior to 1977, when SMCRA was enacted, and that continue to substantially degrade the quality of the environment, prevent or damage the beneficial use of land or water resources, or endanger the health or safety of the public. Specifically, Congress found that a substantial number of acres of land throughout the United States had been disturbed by surface and underground coal mining on which little or no reclamation was conducted. Further, it found that the impacts from these unreclaimed lands imposed social and economic costs on residents in nearby areas as well as impaired environmental quality. Since the abandoned mine land program was created, approximately $3.9 billion has been spent to reclaim abandoned mine lands, and there is at least $10.2 billion in remaining reclamation costs for coal mines abandoned prior to 1977, as of September 30, 2017, according to OSMRE.",
      "Similar issues involving bankruptcies of hardrock mining operators led the Bureau of Land Management to implement regulations in 2001 eliminating the use of self-bonding for hardrock mining. In doing so, the Bureau of Land Management determined that a self-bond is less secure than other types of financial assurances, especially in cases where commodity prices fluctuate. The agency also noted that operators that would otherwise be eligible to self-bond should not have a significant problem obtaining another type of financial assurance. In our previous work examining other types of environmental cleanup, we found that the financial risk to the government and the amount of oversight needed for self-bonds are relatively high compared to other forms of financial assurances. Furthermore, we also previously reviewed federal financial assurance requirements for coal mining, hardrock mining, onshore oil and gas extraction, and wind and solar energy production and found that of these activities coal mining is the only one where self-bonding was allowed. Because SMCRA explicitly allows states to decide whether to accept self-bonds, eliminating the risk that self-bonding poses to the federal government and states would require that SMCRA be amended. Unanticipated reclamation costs, such as those related to long-term treatment for water pollution, may arise late in a mine\u2019s projected lifespan, and the operator may not have the financial means to cover the additional costs, according to OSMRE officials. Under SMCRA, OSMRE and state regulatory authorities are not to approve a permit for a coal mine if the regulatory authority expects the mine to result in long-term water pollution. As a result, since long-term water pollution is not anticipated to occur, the cost of addressing it would not be included in the initial financial assurance that the operator provides. If the regulatory authority later determines that long-term water treatment is needed, the regulatory authority must adjust the amount of financial assurance that the operator is required to provide."
