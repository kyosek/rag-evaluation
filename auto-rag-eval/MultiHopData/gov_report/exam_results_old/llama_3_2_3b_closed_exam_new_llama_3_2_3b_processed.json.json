    "question": "The Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988 established the foundation for the current U.S. policy to potentially provide federal payment for a portion of claims by third parties for injury, damage, or loss that results from a commercial launch or reentry accident. A stated goal of the act was to provide a competitive environment for the U.S. commercial space launch industry. The act also provided for, among other things, government protection against some losses\u2014referred to as indemnification\u2014while still minimizing the cost to taxpayers. All FAA-licensed commercial launches and reentries by U.S. companies, whether unmanned or manned and from the United States or overseas, are covered by federal indemnification for third-party damages that result from the launch or reentry.\n\nAccording to agency officials, in 2016 FAA issued five active licenses, which had an average third-party MPL of about $51 million and ranged from $10 million to $99 million. The amount of insurance coverage that FAA requires launch companies to purchase\u2014the MPL value\u2014is intended to reflect the greatest dollar amount of loss to third parties and the federal government for bodily injury and property damage that can be reasonably expected to result from a launch or reentry accident.\n\nFAA calculates separate MPL values for potential damages to third parties and the federal government. For each launch license that it issues, FAA determines MPL values for third parties with the intent of estimating the greatest dollar amount of losses that reasonably could be expected from a launch or reentry accident, which have no less than a 1 in 10 million chance of occurring. For damages to the federal government, FAA determines MPL values with the intent of estimating the greatest dollar amount of losses that reasonably could be expected from a launch or reentry accident, which have no less than a 1 in 100,000 chance of occurring.\n\nAgency officials said that the current probability thresholds are set such that losses are very unlikely to exceed launch companies\u2019 private insurance and become potential costs for the government under CSLCA. FAA\u2019s process for determining the MPL value for a launch or reentry license generally includes three elements: 1. Number of casualties. Estimating the number of third-party casualties involves adding the number of direct and secondary casualties that could result from a launch accident. Direct casualty estimates include serious injuries and deaths. Secondary casualties include those resulting from fires and collapsing buildings. 2. Cost of casualties. FAA uses $3 million as an estimate of the average loss per casualty, which is multiplied by the number of estimated casualties. 3. Property damage. FAA applies a predetermined factor\u2014which it recently changed from 50 percent to 25 percent\u2014to the estimated cost of casualties to derive estimated losses from property damage.\n\nThe MPL is equal to the estimated cost of casualties plus property damage. FAA has revised two components of its MPL methodology since our 2012 report. For example, in April 2016, the agency adopted a new method for estimating the number of casualties, known as the risk profile method. This method uses different tools to simulate a range of possible scenarios to create a distribution of potential casualty numbers and the simulated probability of different levels of casualty numbers. The risk profile method replaced FAA\u2019s \u201coverlay method,\u201d which was a method it had used since the early 1990s which the agency said did not work well for launches of small launch vehicles in remote areas, or for reentries. In addition, FAA reduced the factor it uses to estimate losses due to property damage, based on tests of a new process for estimating such losses that showed the previous factor was too high.\n\nWe have previously reviewed FAA\u2019s MPL methodology in 2012 and 2017. In 2012 we examined the U.S. government\u2019s indemnification policy, the federal government\u2019s potential costs for indemnification, and the effects of ending indemnification on the competitiveness of U.S. launch companies, among other aspects of FAA\u2019s MPL methodology.",

    "question": "The FAA's AIP grant program has been criticized for its limitations in addressing the growing need for airport capacity enhancements. Some argue that the program's focus on noise mitigation and other non-capacity related projects is a distraction from the real issue. Others claim that the program's eligibility restrictions, such as the requirement that projects must \"enhance airfield capacity in terms of increased aircraft operations, increased aircraft seating or cargo capacity, or reduced airfield operational delays,\" are too narrow and do not account for the complex needs of modern airports. What is the primary concern of airports and air carriers regarding the AIP grant program?",

However, China's improving naval capabilities and island-building activities in the SCS pose a potential challenge to the U.S. Navy's ability to achieve and maintain control of blue-water ocean areas in wartime. This challenge is part of a broader Chinese military challenge to the long-standing status of the United States as the leading military power in the Western Pacific. In response to China's actions in the SCS, the United States should consider reviewing China's approach to the region, which appears to prioritize the assertion and defense of its maritime territorial claims in the SCS and ECS. This approach can be characterized as a \"salami-slicing\" strategy or gray zone operations, where China gradually strengthens its position in the SCS and imposes costs on the United States for its actions. The United States should also consider how to respond to China's strengthening position in the SCS, particularly in light of the potential for a U.S.-China crisis or conflict in the SCS and the broader U.S.-Chinese strategic competition.",

A third FON operation in the SCS was conducted on May 10, 2016, in which the destroyer William P. Lawrence conducted an innocent passage within 12 nautical miles of Fiery Cross Reef, a Chinese-occupied feature in the Spratly Islands that is also claimed by Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Philippines.\n\nChunk2: Unlike the USS Lassen operation, which appeared to be a challenge to some theoretical or \"phantom\" territorial sea, the Dewey transit properly reflects the high seas nature of the waters immediately surrounding Mischief Reef as high seas. As a feature on the Philippine continental shelf, Mischief Reef is not only incapable of ever generating a territorial sea but also devoid of national airspace.\n\nChunk3: A September 1, 2017, press report states that The Pentagon for the first time has set a schedule of naval patrols in the South China Sea in an attempt to create a more consistent posture to counter China's maritime claims there, injecting a new complication into increasingly uneasy relations between the two powers.\n\nChunk4: State Department officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. But Pentagon officials held the view that it was time to impose a cost on the Chinese for their behavior in the South China Sea, the officials said. A June 3, 2018, press report states the following: The United States is considering intensified naval patrols in the South China Sea in a bid to challenge China's growing militarization of the waterway, actions that could further raise the stakes in one of the world's most volatile areas.\n\nCorrect Answer: D",
