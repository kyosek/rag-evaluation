The firm can either exit the industry and pursue higher returns in other industries that are not subject to tax or pass along the tax in the form of higher prices to businesses that purchase advertising services. However, the firm's market power, which is influenced by factors such as lack of competition and the presence of complements and substitutes, may affect the economic incidence of the tax. In a perfectly competitive market, the economic burden of the tax is borne by the consumers of the digital services in the form of higher prices over the long term.

However, the current FR2 system is designed to collect aggregate-level data, and individual military service systems will continue to maintain more detailed case-level information on incidents. According to ODMEO officials, their adaptation of FR2 is intended to collect aggregate-level sexual harassment data from the military services, but it will not collect case-level details such as descriptions of specific incidents or information on dates associated with investigations or appeals. This approach is intended to avoid personally identifiable information. However, some critics argue that this approach may lead to inconsistent data across the military services, as each service has its own data elements and definitions for sexual harassment incidents. What is a potential consequence of implementing this approach, given the lack of standard data elements and definitions for sexual harassment data across the military services?",

Proponents of creating such a statute argue that it would encourage greater use of BBC, which could lead to increased savings in DOD procurement programs. However, opponents argue that a key advantage of BBC is that it is not governed by a permanent statute, which gives DOD and Congress full flexibility in determining when and how to use BBC. Additionally, the Coast Guard, as a military service, is already authorized to use MYP and BBC, and has the authority to do so under Section 311 of the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018. Which of the following best summarizes the potential impact of creating a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC on the flexibility of DOD and Congress to make changes in DOD procurement programs in future years?",

The program's cost estimate is based on a life-cycle cost analysis that includes both government and contractor costs over the program's full life cycle.

Despite these limitations, the agency's cost specialists have reviewed the estimate and found it to be technically reasonable. What is the primary concern with the agency's cost estimate?",
