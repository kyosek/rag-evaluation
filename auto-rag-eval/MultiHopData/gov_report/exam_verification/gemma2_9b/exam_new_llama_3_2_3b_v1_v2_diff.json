      "In addition to our site visits, we selected 12 additional stakeholders that included health care providers or administrators in non-hospital settings across the United States; officials from medical specialty societies; and experts. Specifically, we spoke with (1) health care providers (including physicians or nurses) or administrators from four non-hospital settings in Arizona, Ohio, Washington, and West Virginia, which were selected based on recommendations from stakeholders we interviewed and on the availability of such settings and their experience treating NAS; (2) health care providers from five medical specialty societies, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, MedNAX (a network of physicians that specialize in neonatal care, including NAS treatment), and the National Association of Neonatal Nurses; and (3) three experts, including the authors of published literature we reviewed. We interviewed each of these 32 stakeholders and requested information from stakeholders about treating infants with NAS, including the utilization of available hospital and non-hospital care settings and associated costs of treatment services. For example, we requested protocols for screening and treating infants with NAS from hospital and non-hospital care settings. We reviewed available protocols provided by hospitals and a non-hospital care setting. We also reviewed available information reported by state officials, hospital and non-hospital providers, and state perinatal collaboratives on the utilization of hospital and non-hospital care settings, the facilities’ cost of treating NAS in hospital and non-hospital settings, the lengths of stay for treating infants with NAS, or the amount of Medicaid payments for treating infants with NAS. We discussed the information provided by stakeholders and examined the information for obvious errors. The information obtained from these stakeholders is not generalizable to other states or other hospital and non-hospital settings.",
      "Figure 2 depicts nursery rooms in the neonatal withdrawal center in West Virginia. Efforts are also underway to open a neonatal withdrawal center in Arizona and Ohio, according to stakeholders we interviewed. Stakeholders we interviewed and the literature we reviewed suggest some limitations as well as benefits of treating infants with NAS in non- hospital settings, including factors to consider in these settings. Health care providers from one of the hospitals we visited in Vermont told us that their hospital is the only one in the state that allows infants with NAS to complete pharmacologic treatment through the Vermont outpatient clinic because they have established the necessary infrastructure to ensure families’ compliance and safe practices at home. These providers said that they worked with one local pharmacy to ensure proper dispensing of the medication. Additionally, these providers measured the amount of medication left over at each follow- up visit with the families. Some state and perinatal collaborative officials told us that neonatal withdrawal centers may not be the best environment to treat infants with NAS because these settings may limit a mother’s access to her infant, since she may not always be allowed to reside with the infant. Such limits, according to officials, do not facilitate bonding between mother and infant. Another state perinatal collaborative official, as well as health care providers and staff, told us that neonatal withdrawal centers may be better for treating infants with NAS because the environment is quieter and less stimulating than hospital settings, such as NICUs. Several studies we reviewed also emphasized that the inpatient-to- outpatient approach requires ongoing coordination, communication, and commitment from multidisciplinary providers, as well as the families. These studies highlighted instances in which these approaches reduced the length of the infants’ stay in a hospital, though the studies emphasized that more work needs to be done to determine whether these are the optimal approaches for infants with NAS, as well as the potential long-term benefits of such approaches."

      "When the 109 th Congress adjourned in December 2006, it had not completed action on appropriations legislation to fund EPA (or on nine other appropriations bills covering the majority of domestic discretionary agencies and departments) for the fiscal year that began October 1, 2006, thus carrying over this legislative activity into the 110 th Congress. In December 2006, Congress enacted a continuing resolution, P.L. 109-383 (the third such continuing resolution since the start of the fiscal year on October 1), providing funds for EPA and the other affected agencies and departments until February 15, 2007. The President's FY2007 budget request for clean water SRF capitalization grants was 22% less than the FY2006 appropriation for these grants and 37% below the FY2005 funding level. The request for drinking water SRF grants was essentially the same as in recent years ($4 million more than FY2006, $1.7 million less than FY2005). As in recent budgets, the Administration proposed no funding for congressionally designated water infrastructure grants, but, as noted above, it did seek a total of $40.6 million for Administration priority projects. Advocates of the clean water SRF program (especially state and local government officials) again contended, as they have for several recent years, that the cuts would impair their ability to carry out needed municipal wastewater treatment plant improvement projects. Administration officials responded that cuts for the clean water SRF in FY2007 were necessary because Congress boosted funds above the requested level in FY2005 and FY2006. On May 18, 2006, the House passed H.R. 5386 ( H.Rept. 109-465 ), providing the requested level of $687.6 million for clean water SRF grants and $841.5 million for drinking water SRF grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the same funding levels for these grant programs when it reported H.R. 5386 on June 29 ( S.Rept. 109-275 ), but the Senate did not act on this measure before the 109 th Congress adjourned in December.",
      "Before adjournment, Congress enacted a continuing resolution (CR), P.L. 109-383 (the third such CR since the start of the fiscal year on October 1), providing funds for EPA and the other affected agencies and departments until February 15, 2007. Funding levels provided under this CR followed a \"lowest level\" concept for individual programs; that is, programs were funded at the lowest level under either House-passed FY2007 appropriations, Senate-passed appropriations, or the FY2006 funding. For clean water SRF grants, the resulting appropriation through mid-February was $687.6 million, as in House-passed H.R. 5386 . For drinking water SRF grants, the appropriation level through mid-February was $837.5 million, the FY2006-enacted level. The CR included funds for congressionally earmarked water infrastructure project grants totaling $200 million, as in House-passed H.R. 5386 . Returning to these issues in 2007, in mid-February, Congress passed H.J.Res. 20 , a continuing appropriations resolution that provides funding for EPA and the other affected agencies through the end of FY2007. As passed, this full-year resolution held most programs and activities at their FY2006 appropriated levels. However, clean water SRF capitalization grants were one of the few programs that received a funding increase under the resolution: these grants received $1.08 billion ($197 million more than in FY2006, and $396 million more than the President requested for FY2007). The resolution further prohibited project grants for congressional earmarks, but not for special project grants requested in the President's budget. The action to ban earmarks in FY2007 occurred when leaders in the 110 th Congress sought to finish up appropriations actions that were unresolved at the end of the 109 th Congress, and at the same time the newly elected Congress moved to adopt rules and procedures to reform the congressional earmarking process for the future. (Water infrastructure project earmarks totaled $281 million in EPA's FY2006 appropriation.)",
      "According to subcommittee documents, the reduction was appropriate because, despite recent federal support, little progress has been made to reduce the known water infrastructure gap. The full committee did not complete markup of this bill. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies drafted an alternative bill that would have maintained funding for the clean water SRF program at $1.45 billion and funding for the drinking water SRF program at $907 million. There was no further action on this bill. Congress did not reach final agreement on FY2014 appropriations before the start of the fiscal year on October 1, but did agree to a short-term continuing appropriations measure ( P.L. 113-46 ), which provided funding through January 15, 2014. Final action on appropriations for EPA and all other federal agencies and departments occurred as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 ( H.R. 3547 , P.L. 113-76 ), signed by the President on January 17, 2014. This bill provides $1.45 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants (5% more than FY2013 funds and 32% higher than the President's FY2014 budget request) and $907 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants (5% more than FY2013 funds and 11% higher than the President's FY2014 budget request). The bill also provides $15 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border assistance, and $1.0 billion for state categorical grants, which generally support state and tribal implementation of a range of environmental programs. President Obama presented the Administration's FY2015 budget on March 4, 2014. It sought $7.89 billion overall for EPA, including $1.018 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants, $757 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants, $15 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border projects, and $1.13 billion for state categorical grants. The total amount requested for SRF capitalization grants was 25% below the FY2014 enacted level."

    "question": "The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request for the Department of Energy (DOE) includes a proposal to eliminate the Advanced Research Projects Agency—Energy (ARPA-E) and rescind $287 million of the agency's unobligated balances. However, Congress increased the program's funding in both FY2018 and FY2019. What is the primary reason for the Administration's decision to eliminate ARPA-E in the FY2020 budget request, despite the previous increases in funding, and how does this decision align with the Administration's stated goal of reducing the national debt?",
    "choices": [
      "A) The Administration believes that ARPA-E's research focus on fusion energy is not aligned with the country's energy priorities, and this decision is part of a broader effort to reduce the national debt by eliminating non-essential programs.",
      "B) The Administration is concerned that ARPA-E's funding is too high and is diverting resources away from other critical energy programs, but this concern is outweighed by the need to reduce the national debt.",
      "C) The Administration wants to consolidate DOE's research programs and eliminate redundancies, but this decision is not directly related to the national debt.",
      "D) The Administration is trying to reduce the national debt by eliminating a program that is not essential to the country's energy needs, but this decision is not supported by the Administration's stated goals."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A)",
    "documentation": [
      "Because ARPA-E provides advance funding for projects for up to three years, oversight and management of the program would still be required during a phaseout period. According to the Administration budget request, \"ARPA-E will utilize the remainder of its unobligated balances to execute the multi-year termination of the program, with all operations ceasing by FY 2022.\" The FY2020 budget request for DOE Weapons Activities is 12% greater than the FY2019 enacted level ($12.4 billion vs. $11.1 billion). Weapons Activities programs are carried out by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semiautonomous agency within DOE. Under Weapons Activities, FY2020 funding for nuclear warhead life-extension programs (LEPs) would increase by 10% ($2.1 billion vs $1.9 billion). The two most notable increases within that account are the funding request for W80-4 LEP, which increases by 37% ($898.6 million vs. $654.8 million) and the initiation of funding for the W87-1 LEP. The increase in the request for the W80-4 warhead, which is due to be carried on the new long-range standoff weapon (a new cruise missile), apparently is the result of a new budget estimate, as the Department of Defense is not accelerating development of the missile. The FY2020 request seeks $112 million for the W87-1 warhead (formerly the Interoperable Warhead 1, or IW-I), which received $53 million in FY2019. This warhead is to be carried by the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, a new land-based missile that is scheduled to enter the force in the 2030s. The FY2020 budget request seeks $10 million for the W76-2 LEP, down from $65 million in FY2019. Work on this warhead is nearly complete. It is a low-yield modification of the current W76 warhead carried by U.S. submarine-launched ballistic missiles. It remains controversial in Congress despite its relatively low price tag. In FY2020, NNSA is seeking $51.5 million, in the Stockpile Systems account, for surveillance efforts for the B83 gravity bomb, the most powerful bomb in the U.S. inventory.",
      "This effort represents a 47% increase over the $35 million request in FY2019. The Obama Administration had planned to retire this bomb, but the Trump Administration reversed that decision in its 2018 Nuclear Posture Review. This decision may also prove controversial, as several Senators have been vocal supporters of the plan to retire the bomb. Within the Strategic Materials account in the NNSA budget, funding for Plutonium Sustainment would increase 97%, from $361 million enacted for FY2019 to $712 million requested for FY2020. This increase would support the Administration's plans to produce plutonium pits (or cores) for nuclear warheads at two facilities—Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. The Administration is seeking $410 million to begin conceptual design and pre-Critical Decision (CD)-1 activities at Savannah River. For more information, see CRS Report R44442, Energy and Water Development Appropriations: Nuclear Weapons Activities , by Amy F. Woolf. DOE's Office of Environmental Management (EM) is responsible for environmental cleanup and waste management at the department's nuclear facilities. The total FY2020 appropriations request for EM activities of $6.469 billion would be a decrease of $706 million (-10%) from FY2019. The budgetary components of the EM program are Defense Environmental Cleanup (-9%), Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup (-20%), and the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund (-15%). The FY2020 request includes a proposal to transfer management of the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) from USACE to the Office of Legacy Management (LM), the DOE office responsible for long-term stewardship of remediated sites. The FY2020 LM budget request includes $141 million for FUSRAP, down from $150 million appropriated to USACE for the program in FY2019. According to the DOE budget justification, \"USACE will continue to conduct cleanup of FUSRAP sites on a reimbursable basis.\"",
      "(For more information, see CRS Report R44874, The Budget Control Act: Frequently Asked Questions , by Grant A. Driessen and Megan S. Lynch.) Several issues raised by the Administration's budget request could generate controversy during congressional consideration of Energy and Water Development appropriations for FY2020. The issues described in this section—listed approximately in the order the affected agencies appear in the Energy and Water Development bill—were selected based on the total funding involved, the percentage of proposed increases or decreases, and potential impact on broader public policy considerations. For USACE, the Trump Administration requested $4.827 billion for FY2020, which is $2.172 billion (-31%) below the FY2019 appropriation. The request includes no funding for initiating new studies and construction projects (referred to as new starts). The FY2020 request seeks to limit funding for ongoing navigation and flood risk-reduction construction projects to those whose benefits are at least 2.5 times their costs, or projects that address safety concerns. Many congressionally authorized USACE projects would not meet that standard. The Administration also proposes to transfer the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program from USACE to DOE. For Reclamation, FY2020 funding would be reduced by $461.6 million (29%) from the FY2019 level, to $1.11 billion. For more details, see CRS In Focus IF11137, Army Corps of Engineers: FY2020 Appropriations , by Nicole T. Carter and Anna E. Normand; CRS In Focus IF11158, Bureau of Reclamation: FY2020 Appropriations , by Charles V. Stern; and CRS Report R45326, Army Corps of Engineers Annual and Supplemental Appropriations: Issues for Congress , by Nicole T. Carter. DOE's FY2020 budget request includes three mandatory proposals related to the Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs)—Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and Western Area Power Administration (WAPA).",
      "On March 22, 2019, after the FY2020 budget request had been submitted, DOE provided $3.7 billion in additional Title 17 loan guarantees for two new reactors under construction at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia. The Vogtle project had previously received $8.3 billion in loan guarantees under the DOE program. The Administration's request for DOE includes $107 million in FY2020 for the U.S. contribution to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), which is under construction in France by a multinational consortium. \"ITER will be the first fusion device to maintain fusion for long periods of time\" and is to lay the technical foundation \"for the commercial production of fusion-based electricity,\" according to the consortium's website. The FY2020 DOE appropriation request, 19% below the FY2020 level, would pay for components supplied by U.S. companies for the project, such as central solenoid superconducting magnet modules. ITER has long attracted congressional concern about management, schedule, and cost. The United States is to pay 9% of the project's construction costs, including contributions of components, cash, and personnel. Other collaborators in the project include the European Union, Russia, Japan, India, South Korea, and China. The total U.S. share of the cost was estimated in 2015 at between $4.0 billion and $6.5 billion, up from $1.45 billion to $2.2 billion in 2008. DOE funding for the project was $122 million in FY2018 and $132 million in FY2019. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget would eliminate the Advanced Research Projects Agency—Energy (ARPA-E) and rescind $287 million of the agency's unobligated balances. ARPA-E funds research on technologies that are determined to have potential to transform energy production, storage, and use. \"This elimination facilitates opportunities to integrate the positive aspects of ARPA-E into DOE's applied energy research programs,\" according to the DOE request. The Administration also proposed to terminate ARPA-E in its FY2018 and FY2019 budget requests, but Congress increased the program's funding in both years.",
      "DOE science programs would be reduced by $1.039 billion (-16%). Programs targeted by the budget for elimination or phaseout include energy efficiency grants, the Advanced Research Projects Agency—Energy (ARPA-E), and loan guarantee programs. Funding would be reduced for USACE by $2.172 billion (-31%), and Reclamation and CUP by $462 million (-29%). Congress did not enact similar reductions included in the FY2018 and FY2019 budget requests. Congressional consideration of the annual Energy and Water Development appropriations bill is affected by certain procedural and statutory budget enforcement measures. These consist primarily of limits associated with the budget resolution on total discretionary spending and allocations of this amount that apply to spending under the jurisdiction of each appropriations subcommittee. Statutory budget enforcement is derived from the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ). The BCA established separate limits on defense and nondefense discretionary spending. These limits are in effect for each of the fiscal years from FY2012 through FY2021, and are primarily enforced by an automatic spending reduction process called sequestration, in which a breach of a spending limit would trigger across-the-board cuts within that spending category. The BCA's statutory discretionary spending limits were increased for FY2018 and FY2019 by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-123 ), enacted February 9, 2018. However, the BCA discretionary spending limits have not been increased for FY2020. As a result, the limits currently in place for FY2020 are substantially lower than the limits that were in place for FY2019. For discretionary defense spending, the FY2020 limit drops from $647 billion to $576 billion (-11%), while the nondefense limit drops from $597 billion to $542 billion (-9%). A bill to raise the defense and nondefense spending limits for FY2020 and FY2021 was reported by the House Budget Committee April 5, 2019 ( H.R. 2021 , H.Rept. 116-35 )."

Modernized Tax Return Database (MTRDB), which serves as the official repository of all electronic returns processed through IRS’s Modernized e-File system. Tax return data is stored immediately after returns are processed. International Compliance Management Model (ICMM)-FATCA International Returns (ICMM-FIR), which collects, parses, and stores data from incoming form reports–such as Forms 8938 and 8966–into the FATCA Database (FDB), which serves as the repository where ICMM-FIR stores data and from which downstream applications can pull data. Integrated Production Model (IPM), which is a downstream data repository that houses IMF data, information returns, and other data. According to IRS officials, data from IPM are consolidated and made available to a variety of downstream, security certified, systems for use in conducive analysis, case selection, and report preparation. Additionally, data from these and other IRS databases are copied to IRS’s Compliance Data Warehouse (CDW) periodically, which captures data from multiple production systems and organizes the data in a way that is conductive to analysis. Table 6 highlights several problems with the consistency and completeness of Form 8938 and relevant parent tax return data stored across the listed databases. Inconsistent and incomplete data on address and filing status of Form 8938 filers: As noted above, elements of parent tax returns— specifically the filer’s country of residence and filing status—are used to determine specified reporting thresholds for Form 8938 filers.",
      "For the three objectives described above, we assessed the reliability of data submitted on Forms 8938 filed by individuals for tax years 2015 and 2016, the most recent data available. These data were extracted from IRS’s Individual Return Transaction File (IRTF) and Modernized Tax Return Database (MTRDB) through IRS’s Compliance Data Warehouse (CDW). We also assessed the reliability of data from FBARs for calendar years 2015 and 2016 by (1) reviewing documentation about the data and the systems that produced them; (2) conducting electronic tests, such as identifying data with significant numbers of missing Form 8938 or FBAR records, or values of foreign financial assets reported outside an expected range; (3) tracing selections or random samples of data to source documents; and (4) interviewing IRS and FinCEN officials knowledgeable about the data. We also reviewed Form 8938 and relevant parent tax return data stored in IRS databases to determine whether IRS management is using quality information collected from Forms 8938 to achieve its objectives, as defined in our Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. We determined that data extracted from IRTF on characteristics of Form 8938 filers and from FBAR filings was sufficiently reliable for our purposes, subject to caveats identified in this report. However, we determined we could not obtain complete data on foreign financial assets reported on Forms 8938 filed on paper. For our fourth objective, we reviewed model international agreements and other documentation, and interviewed officials from Treasury, IRS, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to compare and contrast FATCA and CRS reporting requirements. We also used the collected information to identify what changes, if any, the United States and other countries could implement to align FATCA and CRS reporting requirements. For our fifth objective, we collected documentation and conducted focus groups and semi-structured interviews with 21 U.S. persons living abroad that were subject to FATCA reporting requirements."

      "In August 2017, CBP officials said they continually monitor system health through a 24/7 operations center and have established a group dedicated to addressing the issues related to the January 2, 2017, outage. In September 2017, DHS’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that nearly 100 outages, periods of latency, or degraded service were reported for three TECS Modernization applications between June 2016 and March 2017. The OIG also found that CBP’s monthly reports on TECS system availability did not include periods of slowness or service interruptions that were caused by external factors. For example, the January 2, 2017, incident was identified in CBP outage reports, but was not captured in the monthly report because it was caused by a change to an external feed to the TECS system. CBP officials clarified that the monthly reports only account for interruptions that result in a full loss of operations for all TECS system users. The OIG recommended that CBP develop a plan to address factors that contributed to challenges regarding availability of primary traveler screening applications, among other things. CBP concurred with the recommendations. On January 1, 2018, the TECS system experienced another major outage that caused long airport delays; CBP officials said this incident is under review. CBP officials provided technical comments on a draft of this assessment, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. LOGISTICS SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (LSCMS) FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA) LSCMS is a computer-based tracking system that FEMA officials use to track shipments during disaster-response efforts. It is largely based on commercial-off-the- shelf software. FEMA initially deployed LSCMS in 2005, and initiated efforts to enhance the system in 2009. According to FEMA officials, LSCMS can identify when a shipment leaves a warehouse and the location of a shipment after it reaches a FEMA staging area near a disaster location. FEMA now anticipates reaching full operational capability by June 2019, up to 6 months late.",
      "Recent testing shows progress, but additional operational testing delayed to May 2018. GAO last reported on this program in April 2017 (GAO-17-346SP). In November 2017, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership approved a revised acquisition program baseline (APB) after the LSCMS program experienced a schedule breach. In September 2017, FEMA officials notified DHS leadership that it would not complete all required activities—including follow-on operational test and evaluation (OT&E)—to achieve acquisition decision event (ADE) 3 and full operational capability (FOC) by its initial APB dates of September 2018 and December 2018, respectively. According to FEMA officials, the delay was primarily caused by the need to deploy LSCMS program personnel in support of response and recovery efforts during the 2017 hurricane season. The program now plans to achieve FOC by June 2019—up to 6 months later than initially planned. DHS leadership authorized LSCMS to resume all development and acquisition efforts in March 2016 after a nearly 2-year program pause following program management issues. In October 2017, FEMA officials told GAO that they had completed several development efforts—such as integration with DHS’s asset management system—and were in the process of adding Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) to allow LSCMS to interface with its partners’ information systems. The program’s annual life-cycle cost estimate (LCCE) update continued to be within its APB cost thresholds. However, the program’s APB thresholds are not adjusted to account for risk, which increases the chance that the program could experience a cost breach. As of November 2017, FEMA officials did not anticipate that its schedule delays would lead to a cost breach. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) LOGISTICS SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (LSCMS) The LSCMS program previously experienced significant execution challenges because of poor governance. FEMA initially deployed the enhanced LSCMS in 2013 without DHS leadership approval, a DOT&E letter of assessment, or a DHS-approved APB documenting the program’s costs, schedule, and performance parameters, as required by DHS’s acquisition policy."

      "The next largest groups were visas for students and exchange visitors and temporary workers, which accounted for an average of 9 percent and 6 percent, respectively, of all adjudications during this time period. Although adjudications for visas in some categories increased, others decreased over time. For example, as shown in figure 5, NIV adjudications for temporary workers increased by approximately 50 percent from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 (592,000 to 885,000). During the same time period, adjudications for tourist and business visitors also increased by approximately 20 percent overall (from 8.18 million to 9.97 million), but decreased from fiscal years 2016 to 2017. However, NIV adjudications for student and exchange visitor visas decreased by about 2 percent from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 (1.01 million to 993,000) overall, but experienced a peak in fiscal year 2015 of 1.2 million. Appendix I includes additional information on NIV adjudication by visa group from fiscal years 2012 through 2017. State officials identified reasons to explain these trends: Temporary Workers. Although there was an increase in adjudications across all types of temporary worker visas, the largest percentage increase was for H-2A visas, which are for foreign workers seeking to perform agricultural services of a temporary or seasonal nature. Specifically, adjudications of H-2A visas increased by 140 percent from fiscal years 2012 to 2017 (from about 71,000 to 170,000). State officials noted that H-2A visas are not numerically limited by statute. Further, State officials stated that they believe U.S. employers are increasingly less likely to hire workers without lawful status and are petitioning for lawfully admitted workers, which in part led to an increase in H-2A visa demand. Tourist and Business Visitors. State officials partly attributed the overall changes to tourist and business visitor visas to the extension of the validity period of such visas for Chinese nationals, which represented the largest single country of nationality for tourist and business visitor visas in fiscal year 2017 (17.7 percent).",

      "In its own backyard, however, Beijing is making it increasingly clear that it calls the shots. And for now, there is little sign anyone in Washington—or anywhere else—has the appetite to seriously challenge that assumption. An April 9, 2018, article from a Chinese media outlet states the following: The situation in the South China Sea has been developing in favor of China, said Chinese observers after media reported that China is conducting naval drills in the region, at the same time as \"three US carrier battle groups passed by\" the area. \"The regional strategic situation is tipping to China's side in the South China Sea, especially after China's construction of islands and reefs,\" Chen Xiangmiao, a research fellow at the National Institute for the South China Sea, told the Global Times on Sunday. China has strengthened its facilities in the region and conducted negotiations and cooperation on the South China Sea, which have narrowed China's gap in power with the US, while gaining advantages over Japan and India, according to Chen. U.S. Navy Admiral Philip Davidson, in responses to advance policy questions from the Senate Armed Services Committee for an April 17, 2018, hearing before the committee to consider nominations, including Davidson's nomination to become Commander, U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), stated the following in part (emphasis added): With respect to their actions in the South China Sea and more broadly through the Belt and Road Initiative, the Chinese are clearly executing deliberate and thoughtful force posture initiatives. China claims that these reclaimed features and the Belt and Road Initiative [BRI] will not be used for military means, but their words do not match their actions.... While Chinese air forces are not as advanced as those of the United States, they are rapidly closing the gap through the development of new fourth and fifth generation fighters (including carrier-based fighters), long range bombers, advanced UAVs, advanced anti-air missiles, and long-distance strategic airlift."

      "[I]n Oregon v. Mitchell (42 U.S. 112 (1970)), the Court upheld the power of Congress to reduce the voting age in presidential elections and to set a thirty-day durational residency period as a qualification for voting in presidential elections. Although the Justices were divided on the reasons, the rationale emerging from this case, considered with Williams v. Rhodes , (393 U.S. 20 1968)) is that the Fourteenth Amendment limits state discretion in prescribing the manner of selecting electors and that Congress in enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment may override state practices that violate that Amendment and may substitute standards of its own. Critics of the electoral college system have sought direct election of the President and Vice President without success for more than two centuries. The NPV initiative represents a novel effort to achieve this goal by use of an interstate compact that would circumvent the stringent requirements necessary for the proposal and ratification of constitutional amendments. Since its inception in 2006, NPV has achieved a degree of success: 14 states and the District of Columbia, controlling a total of 189 electoral votes, have joined the compact since 2008. Progress has arguably been sporadic, however, notwithstanding active campaigning by National Popular Vote Inc. Over the course of more than a decade, NPV has heretofore failed to develop a sustained momentum toward its stated goal of states controlling 270 electoral votes. The action of three states in joining NPV to date in 2019 marks the most activity in a single year since 2008; it remains to be seen whether this trend will continue. To date, certain Democratic-leaning states have joined the compact. The arguable lack of support in Republican-controlled state legislatures raises questions about further accessions to the compact in the immediate future, particularly given the fact that the GOP controlled both legislative chambers in 30 states following the 2018 elections. To date, while the NPV initiative has generated interest among supporters of direct popular election of the President, it does not appear to have gained widespread awareness among the public at large.",
      "Between 1949 and 1979, Congress considered amendments to reform the electoral college, or replace it with direct popular election, in committee and on the floor of both chambers. Proposed amendments must, however, meet the requirements of the Constitution's Article V, which calls for two-thirds approval by both houses of Congress, and ratification by three-fourths of the states; to date, no electoral college reform proposal has met these requirements. Proponents of the National Popular Vote initiative contend that their plan will achieve direct popular election while circumventing the requirements of Article V, and will guarantee that the popular vote winners will always be elected President and Vice President. The fundamentals of the electoral college system were established by Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution, and subsequently revised by the Twelfth Amendment. The Constitution's minimal provisions have been complemented over the past two centuries by a range of federal and state laws, political party procedures, and enduring political traditions, leading to the system as it exists today. The salient features of the contemporary system are detailed below. The electors are collectively known as the electoral college; although this phrase does not appear in the Constitution, it gained currency in the early days of the republic, and was recognized in federal law in 1845. The electoral college has no continuing existence; its sole purpose is to elect the President and Vice President. Each state is allocated a number of electors equal to the combined total of its U.S. Senate and House of Representatives delegations. The District of Columbia is also allocated three electors. At present, the total is 538, reflecting the combined size of the Senate (100 Members), the House (435 Members), and the District of Columbia electors. Any person may serve as an elector, except Senators and Representatives, or any other person holding an office of \"trust or profit\" under the United States.",
      "Since its founding in 2006, the National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative has promoted an agreement among the states, an interstate compact that would effectively establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President without a constitutional amendment, while retaining the structure of the electoral college system. The United States is unique among \"presidential\" republics by providing an indirect election to choose its chief executive. The President and Vice President of the United States are selected not by registered voters, but by the electoral college, electors appointed in the states \"in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.... \" Alexander Hamilton, who was \"present at the creation\" of the Constitution in 1787, commented favorably on the electoral college system in The Federalist : The mode of appointment of the Chief Magistrate of the United States is almost the only part of the system, of any consequence, which has escaped without severe censure, or which has received the slightest mark of approbation from its opponents.... I venture somewhat further, and hesitate not to affirm that if the manner of it be not perfect, it is at least excellent. It unites in an eminent degree all the advantages the union of which was to be wished for. Notwithstanding Hamilton's endorsement, the first proposal to change the electoral college system by constitutional amendment was introduced as early as 1800, and since that time more than 700 proposals to reform or eliminate the college have been introduced in Congress. Reform advocates have long focused on the fact that it does not provide for direct democratic election, that less-populous states are afforded an arithmetical advantage due to the assignment of two electors to each state, regardless of population, and that the winner-take-all system makes it possible for candidates to win an electoral college majority and the presidency, while gaining fewer votes than their principal opponents in the popular election.",
      "It should be noted, however, that a range of other political, social, cultural, and economic factors may also contribute to the disparity in turnout between battleground and non-battleground states. NPV further suggests that the disparity in participation may ultimately damage the ability to govern on the state and local levels and could have a negative impact on the legitimacy of public institutions: Diminished voter turnout in presidential races in non-battleground states weakens down-ballot candidates, thereby making the state even less competitive in the future. Governance—not just electioneering—is affected by the winner-take-all rule. National Popular Vote opponents oppose the compact on various grounds. Some argue that it is unconstitutional or \"anticonstitutional,\" that is, contrary to the Founders' intentions and the spirit of the nation's fundamental charter. It is also asserted that NPV would solve few of the electoral college system's alleged problem issues and would create some of its own. Finally, some observers note that the NPV compact is an interstate compact as defined in Article I, Section 10, clause 3 of the Constitution, and as such would be subject to congressional approval. This issue is examined in greater detail in a separate section of this report. On the most fundamental philosophical basis, opponents might argue that the NPV compact violates one of the basic principles of majoritarian democracy: it does not require that candidates win a majority of the popular vote in order to gain the presidency. Rather, it would anoint as winner the ticket that gains more popular votes than any other. A majoritarian democracy, it may be argued, should require a majority in order to elect; it may be further noted that the existing system, by comparison, requires a majority in the electoral college. As one commentary noted only the strictest of majoritarians desire a purely majoritarian presidential election system, and those individuals should be deeply troubled by the prospect of plurality presidencies, which the NPVC [sic] expressly countenances."

      "USDA did not have full documentation of any of the 10 monitoring activities we identified (see table 11). USDA demonstrated that it had partially documented 2 of the 10 monitoring activities (20 percent) by providing us with some, but not all, quarterly performance reports. For one of the agreements, USDA had no documentation of the monitoring activities for that agreement. For its other two agreements, USDA did not have full documentation of the required monitoring activities. USDA officials did not explain why they did not have full documentation. Without full documentation of the required monitoring activities, USDA may not have the information it needs to make appropriate budgetary and programmatic decisions. USAID did not have full documentation of 2 of the 11 total monitoring activities (18 percent) we identified across the three agreements we reviewed (see table 12). USAID had partial documentation of those 2 monitoring activities. For example, USAID provided us with some, but not all, records such as financial reports required by the terms of the monitoring activities in the agreements. According to USAID officials, the agencies’ lack of complete monitoring documentation was in part due to agency officials not following some of their agency’s requirements for managing agreement documents, such as placing all documents in a shared document management system. For example, for one of the agreements we reviewed, USAID officials stated that they stored some agreement documentation electronically—such as modifications, correspondence with the agreement recipient, and quarterly financial reports—but primarily maintained paper files. USAID officials told us they use the monitoring documents of these agreements, such as financial and progress reports, to inform future budgetary and programmatic decisions. For example, according to USAID officials, USAID uses monitoring documents to identify and address potential project delays or other “red flags.” For one of the agreements we reviewed, USAID officials stated these monitoring reports also assist them in determining whether to award additional funds and establish new indicators in subsequent agreements.",
      "Without full documentation of the required monitoring activities, USAID may not have the information it needs to make appropriate budgetary and programmatic decisions. State did not have full documentation for 5 of the 16 monitoring activities (31 percent) we identified across the three agreements we reviewed (see table 13). However, State had partial documentation of 4 of those 5 monitoring activities. For example, State had some, but not all, records such as standard reporting metrics, required by the terms of the monitoring activities in one of the agreements. State did not have documentation of one of the monitoring activities (site visits). According to State officials, the agency’s lack of complete monitoring documentation was in part due to agency officials not following some of the agency’s requirements for managing agreement documents, such as placing all documents in a shared document management system. For example, according to State officials, for one of the agreements we reviewed, the grants officer mistakenly had saved site visit reports and similar documents to personal folders because the officer did not know how to use State’s grant document storage system. As a result, neither the current grants officer nor other State officials could retrieve these documents. In May 2017, after awarding the agreements we reviewed, State took corrective action by issuing the Federal Assistance Directive to establish internal guidance, policies, and procedures for all domestic and overseas grant-making bureaus, offices, and posts within the department when administering federal financial assistance. The directive notes that State implemented a grant management system for domestic and overseas grants to resolve its “significant deficiency in the management of Federal financial assistance.” In addition, the directive indicates that officials from State’s Bureau of Administration, Office of the Procurement Executive, Federal Assistance Division will evaluate compliance with risk assessment requirements and review documentation for selected agreements each fiscal year."

Funds are transferred from a Federal Reserve Bank to a U.S. dollar bank account maintained by State, after which the funds are directed through a correspondent bank or a foreign exchange broker to a foreign bank account maintained by State. A correspondent bank serves as the intermediary between the bank sending a transfer, in this case a U.S. dollar denominated bank account, and the bank issuing payment to the recipient, in this case the State-held account in the recipient country.

      "At the beginning of FY2018, none of the 12 regular appropriations bills had been enacted, so the federal government operated under a series of CRs. The first, P.L. 115-56 , provided government-wide funding through December 8, 2017. The second, P.L. 115-90 , extended funding through December 22, and the third, P.L. 115-96 , extended it through January 19, 2018. In the absence of agreement on legislation that would further extend the period of these CRs, however, a funding gap began with the expiration of P.L. 115-96 at midnight on January 19. A furlough of federal personnel began over the weekend and continued through Monday of the next week, ending with enactment of a fourth CR, P.L. 115-120 , on January 22. At the beginning of FY2019, 5 of the 12 regular appropriations bills had been enacted in two consolidated appropriations bills. The remaining seven regular appropriations bills were funded under two CRs. The first CR, P.L. 115-245 , provided funding through December 7, 2018. The second CR, P.L. 115-298 , extended funding through December 21, 2018. When no agreement was reached on legislation to further extend the period of these CRs, a funding gap began with the expiration of P.L. 115-298 at midnight on December 21, 2018. Because of this funding gap, federal agencies and activities funded in these seven regular appropriations bills were required to shut down. The funding gap ended when a CR, P.L. 116-5 , was signed into law on January 25, 2019, which ended the partial government shutdown and allowed government departments and agencies to reopen. The funding gap lasted 34 full days.",
      "Similarly, 8 of 13 regular appropriations acts had been enacted prior to the three-day funding gap in FY1984. The most recent funding gaps—two in FY1996, one in FY2014, one in FY2018, and one in FY2019—all resulted in widespread cessation of non-excepted activities and furlough of associated personnel. The legislative history of these funding gaps are summarized below. The two FY1996 funding gaps occurred between November 13 and 19, 1995, and December 15, 1995, through January 6, 1996. The chronology of regular and continuing appropriations enacted during that fiscal year is illustrated in Figure 1 . In the lead-up to the first funding gap, only 3 out of the 13 regular appropriations acts had been signed into law, and budget authority, which had been provided by a CR since the start of the fiscal year, expired at the end of the day on November 13. On this same day, President Clinton vetoed a CR that would have extended budget authority through December 1, 1995, because of the Medicare premium increases contained within the measure. The ensuing funding gap reportedly resulted in the furlough of an estimated 800,000 federal workers. After five days, a deal was reached to end the shutdown and extend funding through December 15. Agencies that had been zeroed out in pending appropriations bills were funded at a rate of 75% of FY1995 budget authority. All other agencies were funded at the lower of the House- or Senate-passed level of funding contained in the FY1996 full-year appropriations bills. The CR also included an agreement between President Clinton and Congress regarding future negotiations to lower the budget deficit within seven years. During the first FY1996 funding gap and prior to the second one, an additional four regular appropriations measures were enacted, and three others were vetoed. The negotiations on the six remaining bills were unsuccessful before the budget authority provided in the CR expired at the end of the day on December 15, 1995. Reportedly, about 280,000 executive branch employees were furloughed during the funding gap between December 15, 1995, and January 6, 1996.",
      "A CR to provide benefits for veterans and welfare recipients and to keep the District of Columbia government operating was passed and signed into law on December 22, 1995. The shutdown officially ended on January 6, 1996, when the first of a series of CRs to reopen affected agencies and provide budget authority through January 26, 1996, was enacted. This funding gap commenced at the beginning of FY2014 on October 1, 2013. None of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2014 was enacted prior to the beginning of the funding gap. Nor had a CR to provide budget authority for the projects and activities covered by those 12 bills been enacted. On September 30, however, an ACR was enacted to cover FY2014 pay and allowances for (1) certain members of the Armed Forces, (2) certain Department of Defense (DOD) civilian personnel, and (3) other specified DOD and Department of Homeland Security contractors ( H.R. 3210 ; P.L. 113-39 , 113 th Congress). At the beginning of this 16-day funding gap, more than 800,000 executive branch employees were reportedly furloughed. This number was reduced during the course of the funding gap due to the implementation of P.L. 113-39 and other redeterminations of whether certain employees were excepted from furlough. Prior to the resolution of the funding gap, congressional action on appropriations was generally limited to a number of narrow CRs to provide funding for certain programs or classes of individuals. Of these, only the Department of Defense Survivor Benefits Continuing Appropriations Resolution of 2014 ( H.J.Res. 91 ; P.L. 113-44 ) was enacted into law. On October 16, 2013, the Senate passed H.R. 2775 , which had been previously passed by the House on September 12, with an amendment. This amendment, in part, provided interim continuing appropriations for the previous year's programs and activities through January 15, 2014. Later that same day, the House agreed to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2775 . The CR was signed into law on October 17, 2013 ( P.L. 113-46 ), thus ending the funding gap.",
      "This bill did not see action on the House floor. As some of the annual appropriations for FY2019 remained unfinished, a consolidated appropriations bill that included a continuing resolution was passed by Congress and signed into law on September 28, 2018, as P.L. 115-245 . The continuing resolution (Division C) continued funding for DHS at a rate of operations equal to that of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018, with some exceptions. The continuing resolution was extended through December 21, 2018, at which point it expired, and annual appropriations for DHS lapsed, resulting in a partial shutdown of DHS for 35 days. Continuing appropriations were restored at the FY2018 rate of operations with the enactment of P.L. 116-4 on January 25, 2019. On February 14, 2019, the House took up H.J.Res. 31 , a consolidated appropriations bill that included eight annual appropriations bills. Division A, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, included $49.41 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.69 billion (3.5%) more than had been provided for FY2018, and $2.04 billion more than had been requested by the Administration in February 2018. In addition to that total, the bill included $12 billion designated for the costs of major disasters—$5.35 billion (80.4%) more than had been requested, and the requested $165 million in OCO funding appropriated for the Coast Guard operating budget, rather than a transfer from the Navy. The bill passed the House by a vote of 300-128, and the Senate that same day by a vote of 83-16. The President signed it into law the next day. Generally, the homeland security appropriations bill includes all annual appropriations provided for DHS, allocating resources to every departmental component. Discretionary appropriations provide roughly two-thirds to three-fourths of the annual funding for DHS operations, depending how one accounts for disaster relief spending and funding for overseas contingency operations.",
      "Congress took only limited action on FY2011 funding for EPA before the start of the new fiscal year on October 1, 2010: a House Appropriations subcommittee approved a bill in July, but no further action followed. At the end of September, the House and Senate passed a continuing resolution to extend FY2010 funding levels for EPA and other federal agencies and departments until December 3, 2010, because no FY2011 appropriations bills had been enacted by October 1. President Obama signed the continuing resolution (CR) on September 30 ( P.L. 111-242 ). This bill was followed by six more short-term CRs before Congress came to final resolution of FY2011 spending on April 14, 2011, enacting a bill to provide funding for EPA and all other federal agencies and departments through September 30 ( P.L. 112-10 ). The final bill reduced overall funding for EPA 15% below the FY2010 level. The enacted bill included $1.522 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants; $963.1 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants; $19.96 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S. Mexico-border projects; and $1.254 billion for state categorical grant programs, which generally support implementation of a range of environmental programs. Policymakers began to consider the budget for FY2012 before finalizing the funding levels for FY2011. The President submitted the Administration's FY2012 budget request on February 14, 2011. It sought $9 billion total for EPA, a decrease of $1.3 billion from the FY2010 enacted level, but 3% higher than the FY2011 enacted level. The President's request included $1.55 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants, $990 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants, $20 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border assistance, and $1.2 billion for state categorical grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. For several days in July 2011, the House debated H.R. 2584 , providing FY2012 appropriations for EPA, but did not take final action on the bill before the August recess."

      "Procuring selected components in this manner under an MYP contract is called an economic order quantity (EOQ) purchase. EOQ purchases can reduce the procurement cost of the weapons being procured under the MYP contract by allowing the manufacturers of components to take maximum advantage of production economies of scale that are possible with batch orders. What gives the contractor confidence that the multiyear stream of business will materialize? At least two things give the contractor confidence that DOD will not terminate an MYP contract and that the multiyear stream of business consequently will materialize: For a program to qualify for MYP, DOD must certify, among other things, that the minimum need for the items to be purchased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the contract in terms of production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities. Perhaps more important to the contractor, MYP contracts include a cancellation penalty intended to reimburse a contractor for costs that the contractor has incurred (i.e., investments the contractor has made) in anticipation of the work covered under the MYP contract. The undesirability of paying a cancellation penalty acts as a disincentive for the government against canceling the contract. (And if the contract is canceled, the cancellation penalty helps to make the contractor whole.) Is there a permanent statute governing MYP contracting? There is a permanent statute governing MYP contracting—10 U.S.C. 2306b. The statute was created by Section 909 of the FY1982 Department of Defense Authorization Act ( S. 815 / P.L. 97-86 of December 1, 1981), revised and reorganized by Section 1022 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 ( S. 1587 / P.L. 103-355 of October 13, 1994), and further amended on several occasions since. For the text of 10 U.S.C. 2306b, see Appendix A . DOD's use of MYP contracting is further governed by DOD acquisition regulations. Under this statute, what criteria must a program meet to qualify for MYP? 10 U.S.C. 2306b(a) states that to qualify for MYP, a program must meet several criteria, including the following: Significant savings.",
      "A 2008 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report stated that DOD does not have a formal mechanism for tracking multiyear results against original expectations and makes few efforts to validate whether actual savings were achieved by multiyear procurement. It does not maintain comprehensive central records and historical information that could be used to enhance oversight and knowledge about multiyear performance to inform and improve future multiyear procurement (MYP) candidates. DOD and defense research centers officials said it is difficult to assess results because of the lack of historical information on multiyear contracts, comparable annual costs, and the dynamic acquisition environment. How does MYP potentially save money? Compared to annual contracting, using MYP can in principle reduce the cost of the weapons being procured in two primary ways: Contractor optimization of workforce and production facilities . An MYP contract gives the contractor (e.g., an airplane manufacturer or shipbuilder) confidence that a multiyear stream of business of a known volume will very likely materialize. This confidence can permit the contractor to make investments in the firm's workforce and production facilities that are intended to optimize the facility for the production of the items being procured under the contract. Such investments can include payments for retaining or training workers, or for building, expanding, or modernizing production facilities. Under annual contracting, the manufacturer might not have enough confidence about its future stream of business to make these kinds of investments, or might be unable to convince its parent firm to finance them. E conomic order quan tity (EOQ) purchases of selected long-leadtime components. Under an MYP contract, DOD is permitted to bring forward selected key components of the items to be procured under the contract and to purchase the components in batch form during the first year or two of the contract. In the hypothetical example introduced earlier, using MYP could permit DOD to purchase, say, the 20 engines for the 20 aircraft in the first year or two of the 5-year contract.",

(c) Contract Cancellations.-The regulations may provide for cancellation provisions in multiyear contracts to the extent that such provisions are necessary and in the best interests of the United States.

      "DOD must estimate that using an MYP contract would result in \"significant savings\" compared with using annual contracting. Realistic cost estimates . DOD's estimates of the cost of the MYP contract and the anticipated savings must be realistic. Stable need for the items. DOD must expect that its minimum need for the items will remain substantially unchanged during the contract in terms of production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities. Stable design for the items . The design for the items to be acquired must be stable, and the technical risks associated with the items must not be excessive. 10 U.S.C. includes provisions requiring the Secretary of Defense or certain other DOD officials to find, determine, or certify that these and other statutory requirements for using MYP contracts have been met, and provisions requiring the heads of DOD agencies to provide written notifications of certain things to the congressional defense committees 30 days before awarding or initiating an MYP contract, or 10 days before terminating one. 10 U.S.C. 2306b also requires DOD MYP contracts to be fixed-price type contracts. What is meant by \" significant savings\"? The amount of savings required under 10 U.S.C. 2306b to qualify for using an MYP contract has changed over time; the requirement was changed from \"substantial savings\" to \"significant savings\" by Section 811 of the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act ( S. 1356 / P.L. 114-92 of November 25, 2015).

The Senate amendment contained no similar provision. The Senate recedes with an amendment that would require that significant savings would be achieved before entering into a multiyear contract."

There is—yes, there is no other shipyard in the world that has the ability to construct a Ford or a Nimitz nuclear aircraft carrier other than what we have in Newport News and the capital investment to do that is prohibitive to set up a second source, so obviously we are—we are content, not with the lack of competition, but we are content with knowing that we're only going to have one builder for our aircraft carriers.

To assess the reliability of the cost, schedule, and agile-related data that were in DHS and the Secret Service’s program management and governance documentation for the IITT investment, we (1) analyzed related documentation and assessed the data against existing agency records to identify consistency in the information, and (2) examined the data for obvious outliers, incomplete, or unusual entries. We determined that the data in these documents were sufficiently reliable for our purpose, which was to evaluate the extent to which DHS and the Secret Service had implemented processes for monitoring the IITT investment’s performance and progress. We conducted this performance audit from May 2017 to November 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. As of June 2018, the Secret Service’s Information Integration and Technology Transformation (IITT) investment included two programs (one of which included three projects) and one project that had capabilities that were in planning or development and modernization, as described below: Enabling Capabilities. This program is intended to, among other things, (1) modernize and enhance the Secret Service’s information technology (IT) network infrastructure, including increasing bandwidth and improving the speed and reliability of the Secret Service’s IT system performance; (2) enhance cybersecurity to protect against potential intrusions and viruses; and (3) provide counterintelligence and data mining capabilities to improve officials’ ability to perform the Secret Service’s investigative mission.",
      "We reviewed the ISC’s best practices for planning for physical security resources within an agency budget process. Additionally, we reviewed the Office of Management and Budget’s and our leading practices in capital decision-making that provide agencies with guidance for prioritizing budget decisions such as “countermeasure projects.” We also reviewed Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government because internal controls play a significant role in helping agencies achieve their mission-related responsibilities. Our findings from our review of the selected agencies are not generalizable to all ISC member agencies, but provide insight into and illustrative examples about selected agencies’ facility risk-assessment methodologies. To determine what management challenges selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring results, we interviewed agencies’ security, maintenance, and budget officials. We requested agency security officials to provide portfolio- wide data on facility security assessments for our review in order to select sites to visit and analyze data for dates of assessments and the status of findings. We assessed the reliability of this data through interviews with knowledgeable agency staff and a review for completeness and any unexpected values. We compiled information from physical security assessments when no portfolio-wide agency data were available. We determined that these data were sufficient for the purpose of our reporting objectives and selected geographically dispersed sites with buildings with higher reported security levels per the ISC Standard, as these higher security levels have greater requirements and therefore the potential for greater resource needs. See appendix II for the 13 sites we selected. For these selected sites, we interviewed agency staff concerning the assessment process, site-specific findings, recommendations, justification for deviations from ISC’s baseline standards, and management challenges faced in addressing physical security needs.",

      "evaluated OMB’s agency risk management assessment ratings to make a determination on how agencies were managing risk to their enterprise. These conclusions were based on FISMA metrics, and are aligned with the five core security functions defined in the cybersecurity framework. interviewed knowledgeable OMB officials and staff to obtain their views on the reported effectiveness of the federal government’s approach and strategy to securing agency information systems. To assess the extent to which OMB and DHS have facilitated the use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to secure federal agency information systems, we determined the extent OMB and DHS fulfilled their requirements described in the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 by collecting and reviewing artifacts from OMB and DHS and comparing them to the provisions outlined in the act. We also interviewed knowledgeable officials from OMB and DHS regarding their efforts to fulfill their requirements described in the act. determined the effectiveness of corrective actions taken by DHS to address nine previously reported recommendations we made in our report related to NCPS. Specifically, we collected appropriate artifacts and assessed the artifacts against the criteria used in that report, and determined the extent to which the actions taken by DHS met the intent of the recommendations, and we met with DHS staff responsible for the remediation activities and obtained their views of the status of actions taken to address the recommendations. held semi-structured interviews with knowledgeable officials from the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies. During these interviews, we obtained the agency’s views on whether they need more training and guidance from DHS for NCPS and CDM. We also interviewed knowledgeable officials and staff at DHS to obtain their views on how DHS had improved the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities it provides to federal agencies. We also interviewed DHS officials to obtain their views on the training and guidance that the department makes available to agencies.",
      "Officials from 22 of 23 agencies stated that they wanted additional guidance as it relates to CDM implementation. For example, officials from one agency stated that they would like examples of best practices and successful deployments. These requests for additional training and guidance demonstrate that agencies are either unaware of the available training and guidance, or that the training may not meet their needs. Until DHS coordinates with agencies to determine if additional training and guidance are needed, agencies may not be able to fully realize the benefits of the capabilities provided by the NCPS and CDM programs. Although OMB took steps to report on agencies’ implementation of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, it did not report on all required actions. For example, the office did not submit DHS’s intrusion plan to Congress as required by the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015. In addition, OMB provided various reports to Congress that described agencies’ intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, but the reports did not always include all information required by the act. Further, OMB developed a draft policy and strategy that were intended to improve agency capabilities, but it had not finalized these documents. The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 requires OMB to submit the intrusion assessment plan developed by DHS to the appropriate congressional committees no later than 6 months after the date of enactment of the act. The act also required OMB to submit to Congress a description of the implementation of the intrusion assessment plan and the findings of the intrusion assessments conducted pursuant to the intrusion assessment plan no later than 1 year after the date of enactment of the act, and annually thereafter. Although DHS developed and documented an intrusion assessment plan, which described a defense-in-depth approach to security, OMB did not submit the plan to Congress, as called for in the act. Even though DHS submitted the plan to OMB in January 2017, OMB had not submitted it to Congress as of October 2018 (21 months after DHS submitted the plan and 28 months past the due date)."

      "In addition, we noted that SSA’s incremental development certification policy did not describe the CIO’s role in the certification process or how CIO certification would be documented. However, accurate agency CIO certification of the use of adequate incremental development for major IT investments is critical to ensuring that agencies are making the best effort possible to create IT systems that add value while reducing the risks associated with low-value and wasteful investments. As a result of these findings, we recommended that SSA ensure that its CIO (1) reports major IT investment information related to incremental development accurately, in accordance with OMB guidance; and (2) updates the agency’s policy and processes for the certification of incremental development and confirm that the policy includes a description of how the CIO certification will be documented. SSA agreed with our recommendations and implemented both of them. Thus, the agency should be better positioned to realize the benefits of incremental development practices, such as reducing investment risk, delivering capabilities more rapidly, and permitting easier adoption of emerging technologies. IT acquisitions. FITARA includes a provision to enhance covered agency CIOs’ authority through, among other things, requiring agency heads to ensure that CIOs review and approve IT contracts. OMB’s FITARA implementation guidance expanded upon this aspect of the legislation in a number of ways. Specifically, according to the guidance, CIOs may review and approve IT acquisition strategies and plans, rather than individual IT contracts, and CIOs can designate other agency officials to act as their representatives. In January 2018, we reported that most of the CIOs at 22 selected agencies, including SSA, were not adequately involved in reviewing and approving billions of dollars of IT acquisitions. In particular, we found that SSA’s process to identify IT acquisitions for CIO review did not involve the acquisition office, as required by OMB.",
      "Subsequently, FITARA codified a requirement that agency CIOs certify that IT investments are adequately implementing incremental development, as defined in the capital planning guidance issued by OMB. Later OMB guidance on the law’s implementation—issued in June 2015—directed agency CIOs to define processes and policies for their agencies which ensure that they certify that IT resources are adequately implementing incremental development. Between May 2014 and November 2017, we reported on agencies’ efforts to utilize incremental development practices for selected major investments. In November 2017, we noted that agencies reported that 62 percent of major IT software development investments were certified by the agency CIO as using adequate incremental development in fiscal year 2017, as required by FITARA. VA’s CIO certified the use of adequate incremental development for all 10 of its major IT investments. However, VA had not yet updated the department’s policy and process for the CIO’s certification of major IT investments’ adequate use of incremental development, in accordance with OMB’s guidance on the implementation of FITARA as we recommended. The department stated that it plans to address our recommendation to establish a policy and that the policy is targeted for completion in 2017. Federal agencies engage in thousands of licensing agreements annually. Effective management of software licenses can help organizations avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In addition, effective management can help avoid purchasing too few licenses, which results in noncompliance with license terms and causes the imposition of additional fees. Federal agencies are responsible for managing their IT investment portfolios, including the risks from their major information system initiatives, in order to maximize the value of these investments to the agency. OMB developed a policy that requires agencies to conduct an annual, agency-wide IT portfolio review to, among other things, reduce commodity IT spending."

      "Although the number of sickness beneficiaries stayed relatively stable over time, the number of unemployment insurance beneficiaries increased significantly during and after the most recent economic recession from 2007 to 2009. Railroad unemployment and sickness benefits are financed solely by railroad employers' payroll taxes, based on the taxable earnings of their employees. Employers' tax rates depend on the past rates of unemployment and employees' sickness claims. For calendar year 2018, the employer tax rate ranges from 2.2% to 12.0% on the first $1,560 of each employee's monthly earnings. The payroll tax proceeds not needed immediately for unemployment and sickness insurance benefits or operating expenses are deposited in the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account maintained by the Treasury. This account, together with similar unemployment insurance accounts for each state, forms a Federal Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund whose deposits are invested in U.S. government securities, and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account receives interest based on these deposits. During FY2017, payroll tax contributions from railroad employers totaled $126.4 million and interest income was about $4 million. The RUIA provides for employers to pay a surcharge if the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account falls below an indexed threshold amount. The surcharge is added to the employer's tax rate. However, the total tax rate plus the surcharge cannot exceed the maximum rate of 12.0%, unless the surcharge is 3.5%, in which case the maximum tax rate is increased to 12.5%. From 2004 through 2010, the surcharge was 1.5%. The surcharge in 2011 was 2.5% and 1.5% in 2012 with no surcharges in 2013 or 2014. The surcharge in 2018 was 1.5%, the same as the level in the past three years. Eligibility for railroad unemployment and sickness benefits is based on recent railroad service and earnings. The annual benefit year begins on July 1. Eligibility is based on work in the prior year, or the base year.",
      "To qualify in the benefit year beginning July 1, 2018, railroad workers must have base year earnings of $3,862.50 in calendar year 2017, counting no more than $1,545 per month. New railroad workers must also have at least five months of covered railroad work in the base year. To receive unemployment benefits, a worker must be ready, willing, and able to work. The maximum daily unemployment and sickness benefit payable in the benefit year that began July 1, 2018, is $77, and the maximum benefit for a biweekly claim is $770. However, due to sequestration pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-25 , as amended), the maximum daily benefit of $77 is reduced by 6.2% to $72.23 and the maximum biweekly benefit is reduced by 6.2% to $722.26 through September 30, 2019. Railroad workers receive these benefits only to the extent that they are higher than other benefits they receive under the RRA, the Social Security Act, or certain other public programs, including workers compensation. Unemployment and sickness beneficiaries may receive normal benefits for up to 26 weeks in a benefit year or until the benefits they receive equal their creditable earnings in the base year if sooner. Employees with at least 10 years of covered railroad service may qualify for extended benefits for 13 weeks after they have exhausted normal benefits. Table 2 displays the number and average weekly amount of RUIA benefits paid in June 2018. Workers who apply for unemployment benefits are automatically enrolled in a free job placement service operated by railroad employers and the RRB.",
      "The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), an independent federal agency, administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness insurance for railroad workers and their families under the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA). These acts cover workers who are employed by railroads engaged in interstate commerce and related subsidiaries, railroad associations, and railroad labor organizations. Lifelong railroad workers receive railroad retirement benefits instead of Social Security benefits; railroad workers with nonrailroad experience receive benefits either from railroad retirement or Social Security, depending on the length of their railroad service. The number of railroad workers has been declining since the 1950s, although the rate of decline has been irregular and recent years have seen increases in railroad employment after reaching an all-time low of 215,000 workers in January 2010. Recently, railroad employment peaked in April 2015 to 253,000 workers, the highest level since November 1999, and then declined through FY2017, falling to 221,000 workers. The total number of beneficiaries under the RRA and RUIA decreased from 623,000 in FY2008 to 574,000 in FY2017, and total benefit payments increased from $10.1 billion to $12.6 billion during the same time. During FY2017, the RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries. Almost $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits were paid to approximately 28,000 claimants. This report explains the programs under RRA and RUIA, including how each program is financed, the eligibility rules, and the types of benefits available to railroad workers and family members. It also discusses how railroad retirement relates to the Social Security system. For a quick overview of this topic, see CRS In Focus IF10481, Railroad Retirement Board: Retirement, Survivor, Disability, Unemployment, and Sickness Benefits .",
      "The RRA authorizes retirement, survivor, and disability benefits for railroad workers and their families. In December 2017, there were a total of 526,100 RRA beneficiaries, decreasing from 672,400 in 2001. This decline might partly result from the decline in railroad employment in the past five decades. The average monthly benefit for each beneficiary was about $1,986 in 2017, which increased from $1,043 in 2001, reflecting the growth in average wages and prices (see Figure 1 ). The railroad retirement, disability, and survivor program is mainly financed by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT) (see Figure 2 ), all of which accounted for 93.9% of the $12.7 billion gross funding of the RRA program during FY2017. The remaining 6.1% of the program was financed by federal income taxes levied on railroad retirement benefits, interest on investment and other revenue, and general appropriations to pay the costs of phasing out vested dual benefits. Payroll taxes, which provided 47.0% of gross RRA funding in FY2017, are the largest funding source for railroad retirement, survivor, and disability benefits. Railroad retirement payroll taxes are divided into two tiers—Tier I and Tier II taxes. The Tier I tax is the same as the Social Security payroll tax: railroad employers and employees each pay 6.2% on earnings up to $132,900 in 2019. The Tier II tax is set each year based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs. In 2019, the Tier II tax is 13.1% for employers and 4.9% for employees on earnings up to $98,700. Tier II taxes are used to finance Tier II benefits, the portion of Tier I benefits in excess of Social Security retirement benefits (such as unreduced early retirement benefits for railroad employees with at least 30 years of railroad service), and supplemental annuities. Tier I payroll taxes are deposited in the Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account (SSEBA), which pays the Social Security level of benefits and administrative expenses allocable to those benefits."

However, the Navy's plan to guide public shipyard capital investments and the hiring of a new workforce are not sufficient to address the long-term maintenance challenges posed by the increasing complexity of modern naval operations. As the Navy seeks to maintain a global presence and surge capacity, it must also contend with the growing demand for advanced technologies and the need for more efficient maintenance processes. What is the primary concern regarding the Navy's readiness recovery efforts, as identified in the 2016 report, and how does it relate to the Navy's goal of achieving a sustainable level of global presence and surge capacity in the face of emerging threats and technological advancements?",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "Specifically, we found that the shipyards will be unable to support 73—or about one-third—of 218 maintenance periods planned over the next 23 years. In addition, this estimate did not factor in planned increases to the fleet. We made three recommendations, with which the Navy agreed to take steps to improve its management of capital investment in the shipyards. However, we noted that at current average funding levels it would take at least 19 years and a Navy-estimated $4.86 billion to clear the backlog of restoration and modernization projects at the shipyards. Furthermore, this estimate does not include the $9 billion that the Navy estimates it will need for capacity and capability upgrades over the next 12 years to support maintenance operations for the current fleet. In September 2016, we found that although DOD has stated that readiness rebuilding is a priority, implementation and oversight of department-wide readiness rebuilding efforts did not fully include key elements of sound planning, and the lack of these elements puts the overall rebuilding efforts at risk. The Navy states that its overall goal for readiness recovery is to reach a predictable and sustainable level of global presence and surge capacity from year to year. The Navy identified carrier strike groups and amphibious ready groups as key force elements in its plan for readiness recovery and had set 2020 for reaching a predictable and sustainable level of global presence and surge capacity by implementing the optimized fleet response plan. However, we found in 2016 that the Navy faced significant challenges, such as delays in completing maintenance and emerging demands, in achieving its readiness recovery goals for carrier strike groups and amphibious ready groups, and projections show that the Navy will not meet its time frames for achieving readiness recovery. As a result, we recommended that DOD and the services establish comprehensive readiness goals, strategies for implementing them, and associated metrics that can be used to evaluate whether readiness recovery efforts are achieving intended outcomes.",
      "The Navy has started to address workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards. These efforts to address the Navy’s maintenance challenges are important steps, but they will require several years of sustained management attention to reach fruition. As we reported in September 2017, maintenance on ships and submarines may be delayed for numerous reasons, including workforce gaps and inexperience, the poor condition of facilities and equipment, parts shortages, changes in planned maintenance work, and weather. According to Navy officials, all of these issues continue to affect the Navy’s ability to complete attack submarine maintenance on time. According to officials, the Navy has begun to address some of these challenges. For example: The public shipyards have been hiring to address workforce shortages. The number of civilian full-time employees at the shipyards increased from 25,087 in 2007 to 34,160 in 2017, with a goal to reach 36,100 by 2020. Navy officials cautioned that this newly hired workforce is largely inexperienced and will require time to attain full proficiency. The Navy has released a plan to guide public shipyard capital investments. In September 2017 we reported that the Navy projected an inability to support 50 planned submarine maintenance periods over the ensuing 23 years, due to capacity and capability shortfalls at the public shipyards. We recommended that the Navy develop a comprehensive plan for shipyard capital investment. In February 2018 the Navy published its shipyard optimization plan, outlining an estimated $21 billion investment needed to address shipyard facility and equipment needs over 20 years to meet the operational needs of the current Navy fleet, but not the larger fleet size planned for the future. While the public shipyards have operated above capacity for the past several years, attack submarine maintenance delays are getting longer and idle time is increasing. The Navy expects the maintenance backlogs at the public shipyards to continue."

    "documentation": [
      "Rural migrants may settle in informal communities on the outskirts of cities, areas that have little resilience to natural disasters. Although the World Bank and others agree that climate change largely causes internal migration, some evidence shows that the impact of climate change contributes to cross-border migration in Asia. Large numbers of migrants, along with other destabilizing factors, may contribute to instability and conflict, according to the IPCC. The effects of climate change on livelihoods, for example, could increase migration, strain governance, and contribute to conflict as a result. Bangladesh is one example where decreased yields from agriculture and fisheries have contributed to migration to the country’s coastal cities, which face their own climate change challenges. Bangladesh’s high population density and geography make the country susceptible to the effects of climate change, according to the World Bank, and others. Bangladesh’s coasts and river banks are vulnerable to sudden-onset events such as tropical cyclones and flooding. Cyclone Aila in 2009, for example, caused widespread flooding in the southern coastal areas of Bangladesh and impacted millions of people. The storm washed away embankments that protected coastlines and caused severe damage to crops and livelihoods. Tropical Cyclone Mora in 2017 damaged thousands of homes and displaced an estimated 200,000 people. Increases in the number and intensity of tropical cyclones, which some predict will occur in a warmer climate, could have severe impacts on homes, livelihoods, and food security. Bangladesh also experiences many slow-onset climate change events, such as rising sea levels and increasingly severe droughts, which are projected to intensify with climate change. Bangladesh would lose an estimated 17.5 percent of its land if the sea level rose 1 meter, as the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has reported. Projected changes in precipitation levels could cause drought and food insecurity in the northwest and salt-water intrusion could reduce crop yields in the southwest.",
      "Migration is a common adaptation strategy to climate change in Bangladesh, according to the ADB. For example, some farmers have adapted to salt water intrusion and destroyed crops by switching to salt- tolerant rice production or shrimp cultivation. Others have migrated, often to Bangladesh’s cities to find work less dependent on agriculture. Many new migrants to Bangladesh’s cities live in informal settlements that lack the resilience to withstand sudden-onset climate events. The capital city, Dhaka, is a common destination for migrants displaced by salt-water intrusion, flooding, and river erosion, according to IOM. Dhaka, like many coastal cities in South Asia, is located on a low-lying riverbank and faces increasing risks of extreme flooding. For example, past floods in Dhaka have destroyed homes and contaminated drinking water, creating significant health hazards. In some cases, individuals migrate to cities temporarily for work and return home after the agricultural off season ends. Bangladeshis also provide a significant number of labor migrants to the Gulf States and Malaysia. Remittances from international migrants represent 5.4 percent of the country’s GDP, and may help to support resilience to climate change, according to IOM, and others. These migration trends may intensify in the future. One study estimates 9.6 million people will migrate from 2011 to 2050 due to the effects of climate change. Challenges in Stability and Security Migration due to climate change is cited as a potential destabilizing factor in Bangladesh by ADB, and others. The low-income population in Bangladesh is dependent on agriculture, making the effects of climate change—including impacts on food security—a particular concern. By 2030, these effects on livelihoods and food security could increase the poverty rate in Bangladesh by 15 percent, as the IPCC has reported. Given the proximity of Bangladesh to India, some individuals may also choose to cross the border. Increased migration to India is a potential concern, according to some sources, as India may not have the resources to absorb large numbers of Bangladeshi migrants.",
      "However, remittances from family members who leave Brazil’s northeast support resilience for those who remain and may help to reduce migration. Already environmental factors contribute to migration to cities, including to favelas, informal settlements often constructed in hilly areas and floodplains outside of Brazilian cities. A significant number of the favela residents in Rio de Janeiro are migrants from northeastern Brazil, according to IOM. These new migrants may be at risk of further displacement if heavy rainfall, flooding, and other climate change effects destroy their vulnerable homes. For example, heavy rainfall in April 2010 resulted in landslides across Rio de Janeiro, displacing an estimated 5,000 people, according to a report from the World Bank. Brazil is also a destination for migrants from other countries in the region. Migrants from Venezuela searching for jobs and improved food security have come in growing numbers in recent years, as have migrants from Haiti fleeing a series of natural disasters, as IOM has reported. Challenges in Stability and Security Although Brazil ranks 106th out of 178 countries on the Fragile States Index, the effects of climate change may contribute to challenges with water, food, and energy access according to the IPCC. Decreased rainfall could decrease agricultural productivity, with potential health impacts for poor populations. These conditions are of particular concern in northeastern Brazil, as extreme weather and low crop yields are associated with more violence, according to the IPCC. Brazil also receives about 70 percent of its electricity from hydroelectric power, according the United Nations Environment Programme, and recent droughts caused power cuts across many major cities. Although not linked to the effects of climate change, absorbing a growing number of migrants fleeing political and economic instability in Venezuela may impact the broader region, according to the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Intelligence Council.",
      "The effects of climate change in the Middle East and North Africa, including on its desert regions, may impact water access and compound migration and stability challenges, according to the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP). Over 60 percent of the population already experiences high or very high water stress, according to the World Bank. Coupled with unsustainable water use, climate change may further exacerbate challenges with water security. The region continues to experience rising temperatures and declining annual rainfall, trends that contribute to the severity and length of drought, land degradation, and desertification. Decreased water security affects the livelihood and quality of life of farmers in the region, contributing to an increase in their migration to the cities and more urbanization, according to the World Bank. In contrast, many people are expected to migrate away from coastal cities as a result of sea level rise, according to UNEP. These potential migrations would be taking place in a region that already hosts large numbers of migrants such as those displaced by conflict and violence, including 18 percent of the world’s refugees, according to the International Organization for Migration. Challenges in water security may put greater pressure on unstable governments in the region, by intensifying existing tensions and conflicts between populations and their governments as well as between countries that share sources of water. The conflict in Syria illustrates the complex nature of climate change, migration, and conflict in the region, and the challenges to accurately assessing the links among the three, as noted in a technical paper commissioned by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Rising temperatures and declining rainfall have contributed to recent droughts in Syria, a trend that may continue. The country underwent an extended drought from about 2006 until 2011. During the drought an estimated 60 percent of Syria experienced severe crop failure, and accompanying impacts on food security."

      "FNS officials anticipated releasing the framework in mid- 2018. Tools for monitoring e-commerce websites: We also found FNS- recommended tools for automatically monitoring potential SNAP trafficking on e-commerce websites to be of limited use and less effective than manual searches, and FNS has developed but not finalized guidance on using such tools. We recommended that FNS reassess the effectiveness of its current guidance and tools for states to monitor e-commerce and social media websites. In August 2017, FNS officials told us that they had developed revised guidance for states on using social media in detection of SNAP trafficking. According to FNS, the guidance will be incorporated into the SNAP Fraud Framework. Staff levels: During the time of our 2014 work, most of our 11 selected states reported difficulties conducting fraud investigations due to reduced or stagnant staff levels while numbers of SNAP recipients had greatly increased, but FNS decided not to make changes to address this issue. Specifically, 8 of the 11 states we reviewed reported inadequate staffing due to attrition, turnover, or lack of funding. Some states suggested changing the financial incentive structure to promote fraud investigations because agencies were not rewarded for cost-effective, anti-fraud efforts that could prevent ineligible people from receiving benefits. Specifically, when fraud by a SNAP recipient is discovered, a state may generally retain 35 percent of any recovered overpayments. However, there are no recovered funds when a state detects potential fraud by an applicant and denies the application. To help address states’ concerns about resources needed to conduct investigations, we recommended in our 2014 report that FNS explore ways that federal financial incentives could be used to better support cost-effective anti-fraud strategies.

According to USDA, the department also required individual states to develop corrective action plans to address issues identified and monitored progress to ensure states took identified actions. On June 30, 2017, USDA notified the states that the department would not release a national SNAP improper payment rate for benefits paid in fiscal year 2016 and remained focused on conducting the fiscal year 2017 review. FNS has increased its oversight of state anti-fraud activities in recent years by developing new guidance and providing training and technical assistance to states on detecting fraud by SNAP recipients and reporting on anti-fraud activities to FNS. In 2014, we reported on 11 selected states’ efforts to combat SNAP recipient fraud and made several recommendations to FNS to address the challenges states faced. We found that FNS and states faced challenges in the following areas: Guidance on use of data tools to detect fraud: States faced challenges using FNS-recommended data tools to detect fraud, and FNS is in the process of developing improved guidance to address this concern. Specifically, FNS’s guidance on the use of EBT transaction data to uncover potential patterns of benefit trafficking lacked the specificity states needed to uncover such activity, and we recommended FNS develop additional guidance. Since then, FNS contracted with a private consulting firm to provide 10 states with technical assistance in recipient fraud prevention and detection, which included exploring the use of data analytics to analyze and interpret eligibility and transaction data to identify patterns or trends and create models that incorporate predictive analytics. FNS officials also recently told us that the agency is developing a SNAP Fraud Framework to provide guidance to states on improving fraud prevention and detection."

      "Obtaining government clearances in a timely manner. Energy’s NNSA oversight officials and lab management staff, in particular, cited this challenge, which they stated has led to a backlog of people needing clearances. Government hiring freeze constraining overall hiring. Officials at Energy’s government-operated National Energy Technology Laboratory reported that as a result of a government hiring freeze, the lab has increasingly hired private contractor staff to the point that more than half of the total lab staff is now comprised of contractor employees. Major infrastructure challenges at Energy labs. Energy reported in July 2018 that over half of all national lab buildings are in either substandard or inadequate condition. The Energy Inspector General also identified infrastructure modernization as one of Energy’s top management challenges. This finding followed a mandated commission’s report in 2015 that facilities and infrastructure across Energy’s national lab network were hampered by high levels of deferred maintenance and excess facilities. The majority of NASA’s science and technology facilities are operated within the governance framework of government-operated research centers, similarly to most DOD labs. While government-operated, they have been granted additional legislative flexibilities for hiring employees beyond those normally available to government entities. NASA locates its science and technology staff at four government- operated research centers, one contractor-operated FFRDC, and at five NASA centers assisting space and space flight development. These centers and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory—NASA’s sole sponsored FFRDC—execute NASA’s research missions including technology development in exploration and aeronautics. The differences between these two governance approaches are described in Table 4. NASA also works with Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab, a UARC, to develop major space flight missions. The NASA Glenn Research Center—a government- operated laboratory—is currently developing solar electric propulsion technologies intended to allow manned and unmanned spacecraft to be propelled far beyond earth orbit using solar power.",
      "Energy’s national labs form the core of the agency’s scientific work and mission. This is in contrast to DOD-funded labs, which constitute a relatively small aspect of DOD’s overall mission. We have previously found that Energy’s labs can use funding for minor infrastructure improvements. NASA centers can also approve and fund certain facility projects, in accordance with NASA policies, and they have encountered significant challenges with aging infrastructure. Also, in some cases, energy and space research centers have significant challenges with hiring replacement staff and competing with private sector employers for staff. Energy’s labs can hire scientific personnel with the flexibility of private companies, while NASA centers were previously provided hiring flexibilities by Congress in 2004 to facilitate staff hiring. While Energy and NASA’s research entities follow their specific governance models, there are broad characteristics common across these agencies as well as DOD. Table 2 illustrates that while research centers are largely government-owned, the government is not always the operator. As we have reported, Department of Energy national labs are primarily operated by for-profit, non-profit and university FFRDC contractors using management and operating contracts, which are competed on a limited basis. Energy’s funding sponsors and headquarters officials are required to reevaluate FFRDC performance in increments not to exceed 5 years by federal acquisition regulations, which inform future decisions to renew the agreement. In 1990, we designated Energy’s contract management—including both contract administration and project management—a high-risk area because of Energy’s inadequate management and oversight of contractors, leaving the department vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. In 2009, we subsequently narrowed the focus of Energy’s high-risk designation to the National Nuclear Security Administration and Office of Environmental Management, which together oversee four national labs."

    "question": "A federal agency is considering implementing a telework program to reduce its office space. However, the agency's collective bargaining agreement requires that each employee retain an assigned workstation regardless of their type of telework agreement. Which of the following options is most likely to be a challenge for the agency in implementing the telework program?",
    "choices": [
      "A) The agency's mission requires office locations in certain areas, making it difficult to implement desk-sharing or hoteling.",
      "B) The agency's real estate market is highly competitive, making it easy to find alternative spaces that could allow for more effective space utilization.",

      "D) The agency's workforce is highly mobile, making it easy to implement flexible work arrangements."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "Officials said that while the interactions with the union groups were positive—including gaining input on issues such as ergonomics, the security of field offices, and overall implementation—at times, these negotiations caused delays to individual projects and complicated reduction efforts by requiring union buy-in. In addition, Labor reported in its fiscal year 2017 Plan that its collective bargaining agreement and agency mission requirements for offices and work stations do not always enable it to take advantage of the previously discussed GSA Consolidation Funding program as well as GSA’s Total Workplace Furniture & Information Technology program. For example, the Total Workplace Furniture & Information Technology program requires that cubicles and offices must not exceed a specified square footage. However, according to Labor officials, Labor’s Departmental Space Management Regulation requires a certain utilization rate per person which may make it challenging to also stay within the program’s square footage requirements. Workload growth: Eight of the 24 agencies noted that increases in their workload limited their ability to achieve overall agency space reductions. For example, according to the Department of Justice’s fiscal year 2017 Plan, the agency anticipated having to provide additional court rooms to support an increased volume of immigration cases and accommodate the additional immigration judges needed to handle that volume. The Department of Justice estimated that the space needed to accommodate the new judges and additional public areas could add about 155,000 square feet to its portfolio. Also, according to the Department of Health and Human Services’ fiscal years 2016 and 2017 Plans, the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals experienced a 30 percent growth in cases and expected 1.2- million new cases annually after 2017. The Department of Health and Human Services projected that the growth in cases and additional staff needed to process the cases required additional field offices, which would increase its total office space square footage.",
      "For example, the Fiscal Service reduced space by giving up several floors at its Hyattsville, MD, office starting in 2012. According to Fiscal Service officials, they accomplished these reductions by consolidating data centers to other locations, conducting targeted buyouts of employees, and, most recently, by implementing a new space standard of 183 USF per person through smaller workstations. The officials said that the most recent space reduction at this location resulted in savings in annual rent costs not attributable to telework. Looking forward, the Fiscal Service reported that it has started taking preliminary steps to promote efficient space utilization through telework. These steps have included: creating an Executive Space Management Council that discussed incorporating telework and desk-sharing into space management guidelines; implementing a voluntary, informal desk-sharing pilot in one program area for employees who already telework 50 percent or more of the time; and seeking information from GSA, including discussing and visiting GSA offices that have implemented hoteling as part of their space planning model. In addition, the Fiscal Service officials told us that the agency plans to negotiate the impact and implementation of desk-sharing and hoteling for telework employees with its union, but the Fiscal Service has not yet begun this effort. Our analysis of the survey responses from the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies identified three major planning challenges agencies face with using telework to reduce space: human capital issues such as negotiating workspace changes with collective bargaining units and managing organizational change; the suitability of telework to mission work requirements; and difficulty measuring cost savings that might result from space reductions attributable to telework. This measuring difficulty may include both gross savings as well as savings net of costs, such as for renovations or IT investments. See table 3 for examples of space-planning challenges related to telework reported by the 23 agencies.",
      "To address these challenges, nearly two thirds of the agencies we surveyed reported they would like guidance on using telework programs or other alternatives to meet the federal goals of reducing space or using space more efficiently. Our review of agency survey responses, Real Property Efficiency Plans, and other agency space-planning documents, found that human capital challenges to using telework in space planning generally fell into two categories: (1) requirements to negotiate space allocation changes with collective-bargaining units; and (2) managing department workforces in adapting to new workspace designs and altered workspace allocations. Collective-bargaining challenges: Of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies, 7 of 23 noted that changes to telework policy or workspace arrangements required negotiation with collective bargaining units, for example, The Small Business Administration (SBA) reported its greatest challenge to incorporating telework in office space planning has been with negotiating and securing agreement from all parties, including management and its union, on establishing space standards. HUD reported that it could not implement hoteling or desk-sharing as its collective-bargaining agreements require that each employee retain an assigned workstation regardless of an employee’s type of telework agreement. SSA reported that changing floor plans required negotiation with its three collective-bargaining units, which could extend the time needed for construction and relocation. DOT reported that collective-bargaining agreements posed a challenge to incorporating workforce mobility options, including telework. In addition, the collective-bargaining agreements we reviewed from the four agencies we reviewed in detail––GSA, OJP, CDC and Fiscal Service––required negotiations or the opportunity to negotiate changes to matters relating to workspace arrangements and in some cases, to telework policy. Managing change: Using telework as a strategic space-planning tool, particularly in conjunction with complementary space-saving efforts such as desk-sharing, hoteling, or open-space designs, generally involves a cultural change.",
      "Agency missions may require office locations in certain areas or require additional space to accommodate activities such as customer interactions. These requirements may preclude disposals or limit opportunities to reduce space. For example, in its fiscal year 2017 Plan, SSA stated that its efforts to reduce space are affected by its mission, which requires offices widely dispersed throughout the country to administer and support its benefit programs, among other things. SSA has about 1,500 office spaces nationwide, most of which require space to accommodate the public. SSA had an overall office space utilization rate of 301 square feet per person, which exceeded GSA’s recommended office space utilization rate range of 150 to 200 square feet per person. USDA’s fiscal year 2017 Plan stated that its missions require office space in rural areas to, among other things, provide program assistance and leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, nutrition, and related issues. In its fiscal year 2017 Plan, USDA also observed that the real estate market in rural areas is less competitive than in urban areas because there are fewer rental options, a situation that can also drive up rent costs. As such, USDA noted that these factors may contribute to difficulties identifying disposal opportunities and finding alternate spaces that could allow for more effective space utilization. Employee organization concerns: Ten of the 24 agencies reported that considering employee organizations’ concerns and addressing collective bargaining requirements when reconfiguring space can add time and affect the extent of their space reductions. For example, in its fiscal year 2017 Plan, SSA noted that the agency must meet with three employee unions when revising office space policies or design standards and collaborating with these organizations adds to the project’s implementation timeline. In July 2017, we reported that SSA officials met with employee union groups about the impact of potential changes to its space configuration or usage.",
      "This tool—the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool—is aimed at helping agencies quantify the benefits and costs of increased telework participation and implementing other alternative-work arrangements. When completed, the tool will enable users to quickly develop rough estimates of cost and space impacts resulting from workplace changes, particularly relating to desk-sharing, workspace reconfiguration, and consolidation. Key features include the ability to compare up to three scenarios, which in turn may be used to inform a more detailed design program. As of January 2018, GSA had not yet completed the tool. GSA officials said mission needs, resource constraints, and developmental adjustments have contributed to delays in the time frame for completing the tool. They added that during this time, GSA has diverted resources to space calculation tools for individual agencies. For example, GSA worked with DHS on its Space Calculation Tool as a way to help determine workplace space requirements in a manner consistent with DHS space policies. In January 2018, GSA officials told us that they plan to make the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool available to GSA staff in March 2018 along with training on how to use it. However, GSA officials have not decided whether to make the tool available to other federal agencies to use as a space-planning tool. Instead, the officials plan to assess GSA’s use of the tool and then determine in late 2018 if and how it should be released to other agencies for independent use. Given the absence of a government-wide tool, in our review, we found that some agencies had used their own resources to purchase similar tools for their space-planning needs from the private sector. Without such a government-wide resource, agencies may not be able to determine how best to reduce space or use it more efficiently. In responses to our survey, nearly two-thirds of agencies reported that they would find it helpful to have additional information, assistance, or resources to assist them in using telework as a space-planning tool."

      "According to State officials, because of ongoing information management vacancies, some required tasks—such as conducting planned network maintenance—were performed infrequently or not at all. In another example, staff at overseas posts said that because of vacancies, information management staff had been unable to regularly check their computer system logs to ensure that security breaches had not taken place. Post staff added that, if a breach did occur, vacancies could increase the amount of time needed to identify an attack and deploy countermeasures, further increasing the risks to posts’ computer networks. Inspections conducted by State’s OIG from fall 2014 to spring 2016 found that information management staff at 33 percent of overseas posts had not performed various required information management duties. According to State’s OIG, neglect of these duties may leave the department vulnerable to increased cybersecurity attacks. According to staff at overseas posts, the office management specialist position at overseas posts has evolved considerably over time; these specialists increasingly play a critical role in ensuring that the work of overseas posts is effectively completed. Post staff said that office management specialists provide administrative and other support services to other Foreign Service employees and are assigned to various sections of post. For example, staff at one post noted that office management specialists assigned to the Security Officer sections at overseas posts reduce the workload of security officers by completing more routine security tasks and allowing the security officers to focus on more challenging or involved tasks necessary to secure overseas posts. Post staff told us that vacancies in office management specialist positions reduce the amount of work that can be completed by other Foreign Service employees at overseas posts. For example, when office management specialist positions assigned to the Security Officer or Information Management sections of posts are vacant, these vacancies further exacerbate the higher number of vacancies that already exist in these sections.",
      "Among Foreign Service specialist skill groups with the highest number of vacant positions, security officer, office management specialist, and information management had the largest percentages of vacant positions—16 percent, 16 percent, and 14 percent, respectively—as of March 31, 2018. According to staff at overseas posts, vacancies in security officer positions at overseas posts reduce the amount of time that security staff can spend identifying, investigating, and responding to potential security threats to the post. Security officers are also responsible for identifying and analyzing host-country intelligence-gathering efforts at their respective overseas posts—and post staff told us that, because of vacancies in these positions, some security officers had been unable to complete this work for their posts, potentially increasing the risk of foreign government officials gaining access to sensitive information. Also, post staff told us that security officer vacancies limit the amount of time that security officers present at posts can devote to important security oversight activities, including regular training, drilling, and supervising of local guard forces and security contractors. Post staff noted, for example, that security officers at overseas posts should conduct regular training and drilling exercises to evaluate their local guard force’s effectiveness in searching a vehicle entering the post compound for explosive devices. According to post staff, when these important security oversight activities are not properly and regularly conducted, the level of security risk at these overseas posts may increase. According to State officials in headquarters and staff at overseas posts, as well as reporting by State’s OIG, vacancies in information management positions at overseas posts have increased the vulnerability of posts’ computer networks to potential cybersecurity attacks and other malicious threats. State officials told us that the Foreign Service had faced chronic shortages of information management staff available to fill these positions worldwide."

    "question": "Northern Trust's revised investment policy for the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (CSPF) aims to mitigate the impact of market volatility on the plan's funding ratio by shifting assets from equities to fixed income and cash-equivalent investments. However, this decision has been met with criticism from some stakeholders who argue that it may not be the most effective strategy to achieve the plan's long-term goals.

      "Northern Trust’s new investment policy specified the assets under its control would not be invested in nonpublicly traded securities, in order to manage risk and provide liquidity. CSPF Has Limited Options to Achieve Solvency As of March 2018, the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (CSPF) was projected to be insolvent on January 1, 2025. As of July 2017, CSPF officials said that the following measures (in isolation) could help the plan avoid insolvency: 18 percent year-over-year investment returns (infinite horizon), or 250 percent contribution increases (with no employer attrition), or 46 percent across-the-board benefit cut. However, CSPF officials said that investment returns and contribution increases of these magnitudes were untenable, and CSPF’s application to reduce accrued benefits under the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (MPRA) was denied in 2016. CSPF officials and Northern Trust representatives said these asset allocation changes are intended to provide participants greater certainty regarding their benefits and reduce the plan’s exposure to market risk and volatility until it is projected to become insolvent on January 1, 2025 (see fig. 15). Northern Trust is expected to continue to manage 50 percent of the plan’s investment assets until the plan becomes insolvent. While the total amount of assets in the passively-managed accounts will continue to constitute 50 percent of the plan’s assets, the trustees plan to transfer assets from the passively-managed domestic and international equity accounts into the passively-managed domestic fixed income account, which will be gradually transitioned to shorter-term or cash-equivalent fixed-income securities sometime before the end of March 2020 (see fig. 16). CSPF officials said the changes will reduce the amount of fees and transaction costs paid by the plan. Specifically, investment management fees are expected to generally decrease as the plan moves into shorter duration fixed income assets.",
      "After the market downturn in 2001, CSPF trustees told us that J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs explicitly increased the equity allocation in an attempt to generate higher investment returns and increase the plan’s funded ratio—the plan’s overarching investment objective. Between 2000 and mid-2010, when the plan had two named fiduciaries, equity assets increased from about 58 percent at the end of 2000 to between 66 and 70 percent at the end of 2001 and each year thereafter until the end of 2009, mostly based on the named fiduciaries’ decisions to increase the plan’s allocation to domestic equity assets. When Northern Trust became the sole named fiduciary in 2010, the proportion of equity assets declined from almost 72 percent at the end of 2010 to almost 63 percent at the end of 2016. During this time, Northern Trust generally decreased the plan’s allocation to domestic equity assets, increased the allocation to actively-managed fixed income, and started investing in global infrastructure assets. Northern Trust representatives said CSPF’s recent portfolio had been kept relatively aggressive in an attempt to achieve the returns the plan would need to become fully funded while balancing risk (see fig. 14). CSPF’s deteriorating financial condition precipitated a recent investment policy change that will move plan assets into fixed income and cash equivalent investments ahead of projected insolvency. In early 2017, Northern Trust representatives revised the plan’s investment policy because they, in consultation with the trustees, believed the plan had no additional options to avoid insolvency (see textbox). This change to the plan’s outlook led to a significant change in the plan’s investment objective, from a goal of fully funding the plan to instead forestalling insolvency as long as possible while reducing the volatility of the plan’s funding. Northern Trust representatives and CSPF officials revised applicable plan investment policy statements and started to gradually transition the plan’s “return seeking assets”—such as equities and high yield and emerging markets debt—to high quality investment grade debt and U.S. Treasury securities with intermediate and short-term maturities."

(Recommendation 10) We provided a draft of this report to CFPB, FDIC, FinCEN, the Federal Reserve, NCUA, and OCC. We received written comments from CFPB, FDIC, the Federal Reserve, NCUA, and OCC that we have reprinted in appendixes II through VI, respectively. CFPB, FDIC, FinCEN, the Federal Reserve, NCUA, and OCC also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.",
      "In its written comments, CFPB agreed with the recommendation to assess its TRID guidance to determine the extent to which it is understood. CFPB stated it intends to solicit public input on how it can improve its regulatory guidance and implementation support. In addition, CFPB agreed with the recommendation on issuing public information on its plan for reviewing regulations. CFPB committed to developing additional plans with respect to their reviews of key regulations and to publicly releasing such information and in the interim, CFPB stated it intends to solicit public input on how it should approach reviewing regulations. FDIC stated that it appreciated the two recommendations and stated that it would work with the Federal Reserve and OCC to find the most appropriate ways to ensure that the three regulators continue to enhance their rulemaking analyses as part of the EGRPRA process. In addition, FDIC stated that as part of the EGRPRA review process, it would continue to monitor the cumulative effects of regulation through for example, a review of the community and quarterly banking studies and community bank Call Report data. The Federal Reserve agreed with the two recommendations pertaining to the EGRPRA process. Regarding the need conduct and report on quantitative analysis whenever feasible to strengthen and to increase the transparency of the EGRPRA process, the Federal Reserve plans to coordinate with FDIC and OCC to identify opportunities to conduct quantitative analyses where feasible during future EGRPRA reviews. With respect to the second recommendation, the Federal Reserve agreed that the cumulative impact of regulations on depository institutions is important and plans to coordinate with FDIC and OCC to identify further opportunities to seek comment on bodies of regulations and how they could be streamlined. NCUA acknowledged the report’s conclusions as part of their voluntary compliance with the EGRPRA process; NCUA should improve its qualitative analysis and develop plans for continued reductions to regulatory burden within the credit union industry.",
      "The federal depository institution regulators (FDIC, Federal Reserve, OCC, as well as NCUA) also have opportunities to enhance the activities they undertake during EGRPRA reviews. Congress intended that the burden of all regulations applicable to depository institutions would be periodically assessed and reduced through the EGRPRA process. But because CFPB has not been included in this process, the regulations for which it is responsible were not assessed, and CFPB has not yet provided public information about what regulations it will review, and when, and whether it will coordinate with other regulators during EGPRA reviews. Until such information is publicly available, the extent to which the regulatory burden of CFPB regulation will be periodically addressed remains unclear. The effectiveness of the EGRPRA process also has been hampered by other limitations, including not conducting and reporting on depository institution regulators’ analysis of quantitative data and assessing the cumulative effect of regulations on institutions. Addressing these limitations in their EGRPRA processes likely would make the analyses the regulators perform more transparent, and potentially result in additional burden reduction. We make a total of 10 recommendations, which consist of 2 recommendations to CFPB, 2 to FDIC, 2 to the Federal Reserve, 2 to OCC, and 2 to NCUA. The Director of CFPB should assess the effectiveness of TRID guidance to determine the extent to which TRID’s requirements are accurately understood and take steps to address any issues as necessary. (Recommendation 1) The Director of CFPB should issue public information on its plans for reviewing regulations applicable to banks and credit unions, including information describing the scope of regulations the timing and frequency of the reviews, and the extent to which the reviews will be coordinated with the federal depository institution regulators as part of their periodic EGRPRA reviews. (Recommendation 2) The Chairman, FDIC, should, as part of the EGRPRA process, develop plans for their regulatory analyses describing how they will conduct and report on quantitative analysis whenever feasible to strengthen the rigor and transparency of the EGRPRA process."

    "documentation": [
      "With respect to HHS’ January 2017 guidance, state officials reported in our survey and during site visits that they found some terms unclear and were uncertain about what is required of them. In written responses to our survey, states reported challenges understanding how to define substance-affected under CAPTA. In addition, as we note in our report, the guidance about plans of safe care described the following: “While CAPTA does not specifically define a ‘plan of safe care,’ CARA amended the CAPTA state plan requirement . . . to require that a plan of safe care address the health and substance use disorder treatment needs of the infant and affected family or caregiver.” States reported in our survey and in follow-up discussions that this lack of specificity remained an ongoing challenge for them. For example, as we discuss in our report, one state that we followed up with in August 2017 was still unsure about whether its safety plans would meet CAPTA requirements for plans of safe care. In addition, as of October 2017, HHS confirmed that some state plans did not meet CAPTA requirements and that the states were asked to develop program improvement plans. Accordingly, a key ongoing challenge was not addressed by the January guidance. Regarding allowing states flexibility to meet CAPTA requirements, we acknowledge in our report that HHS said that states have flexibility. However, in our survey and site visits, states indicated that they would find it helpful for HHS to provide them with greater specificity around terms, including the degree of flexibility they are allowed. States added that this would include parameters within which they can develop policies and procedures that meet CAPTA requirements. We continue to believe that additional guidance addressing these concerns would benefit states and could be provided without imposing additional mandates. Concerning HHS’ third point that some of the issues raised in the report are not specific to CAPTA, the states we visited interpret CAPTA to require that plans of safe care be developed for all substance-affected infants who are referred to CPS.",
      "In addition, in April 2017, ACF issued a program instruction on reporting requirements, including changes in those requirements brought about by the 2016 amendments to CAPTA. ACF conducted limited monitoring of states prior to the amendments passed in 2016. According to ACF officials, if presented with evidence of potential deficiencies, the agency would attempt to learn more about the state’s activities. In one instance, ACF reviewed South Carolina’s policies and found them to not be in compliance with the notification and safe care plan requirements of CAPTA. It directed the state to develop a program improvement plan to bring it into full compliance, which South Carolina submitted in April 2016. In a recent progress report (February–April 2017), South Carolina reported that it was focused on updating statutes, developing policies and procedures, training child protective service workers, and building relations with health care providers. In response to the 2016 amendments to CAPTA that added the requirement for HHS to monitor state policies and procedures to address the needs of substance-affected infants, ACF officials told us that staff in regional offices will review states’ annual reports, submitted in June 2017. In its program instruction describing the reporting requirements, ACF asked each state to submit a new Governor’s Assurance, as well as a narrative explaining what they have done in response to the amendments. Specifically, ACF asked states to provide information on any changes that were made in state laws, policies, or procedures related to identifying and referring infants affected by substance abuse to CPS as a result of prenatal drug exposure. It also requested updates on states’ policies and procedures regarding the development of plans of safe care; a description of how states have developed systems to monitor plans of safe care; and a description of any outreach or coordination efforts the states have taken to implement the amendments, among other things.",
      "However, states have experienced challenges implementing new CAPTA requirements. Many states reported in our survey that they are not completely adhering to the law. This is reflected in ACF’s review of state plans, some of which are resulting in program improvement plans. States cite challenges that stem, in part, from ACF’s lack of specificity in providing guidance on implementing CAPTA requirements. Specifically, states report that ACF has not provided clear guidance about which substance-affected infants health care providers are required to notify CPS about, as well what a plan of safe care is and for whom it should be developed. Given the challenges that states reported facing in implementing the provisions, a majority reported wanting more help from ACF, such as trainings and teleconferences with other states, to help overcome their challenges. Additional guidance and assistance from HHS would help states better understand what they need to do to develop policies and procedures that meet the needs of children and families affected by substance use. The Secretary of HHS should direct ACF to provide additional guidance and technical assistance to states to address known challenges and enhance their understanding of CAPTA requirements, including the requirements for health care providers to notify CPS of substance- affected infants and the development of a plan of safe care for these infants. We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment. HHS’s comments are reproduced in appendix I. HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated into our report where appropriate. HHS did not concur with our recommendation. HHS stated that: in January 2017, ACF clarified in guidance several of the issues raised in the report, including the population of infants and families covered by the provision and the state flexibility inherent in determining which infants are “affected by” substance abuse, and the terminology used in the federal law of what a “plan of safe care” is; ACF believes it is necessary to allow states the flexibility to meet the requirements in the context of their state CPS program; several of the challenges that the GAO notes are not specific to CAPTA compliance with the safe care plan and notification requirements; and it does see the value in continuing to provide technical assistance to states to address known challenges and to enhance their understanding of CAPTA requirements.",
      "According to a local Kentucky CPS office, the number of babies that met criteria for being accepted for investigation has increased about 55 percent from 2011 to 2016, while the number of staff has remained the same. Similarly, hospitals reported being impacted by this challenge. For example, staff at four hospitals we visited told us that they have delayed discharging infants from the hospital because CPS social workers did not identify caregivers to whom infants may be released or make plans for infants in a timely manner. In addition, staff from three hospitals told us that some CPS workers are difficult to contact and not especially responsive to their questions. One hospital social worker told us that she is concerned that the changes to CAPTA that require notifying CPS of all substance-affected newborns will inundate the agencies with cases. Officials from two of the three states we visited anticipated that providing services to infants affected by the legal use of prescribed medications, but not likely to be at risk for child abuse and neglect, will result in an increase in the number of families referred to CPS. This, in turn, will require a plan of safe care and further strain limited resources. Twenty- five states reported in our survey that the plan they develop for substance-affected infants is the same as for other children in CPS care, suggesting that states devote the same level of resources to these infants as other cases. The states we visited interpret CAPTA to require that plans of safe care be developed for all substance-affected infants who are referred to CPS, including those who may not meet usual criteria to be accepted for an investigation. Some state officials we interviewed questioned whether the new CAPTA requirements would allow for the best use of limited resources. For example, one senior state CPS official questioned whether it would be a good use of resources to develop plans of safe care for mothers in substance use disorder treatment or mothers using opioid medications due to chronic pain.",
      "During our discussions with states and in responses to our survey, state officials did not delineate which federal requirement impacted their approach to serving children and families. As stated in our conclusion, vulnerable infants may be at risk for child abuse and neglect if adequate supports and services are not available to ensure their safety. Lastly, HHS indicated that it will continue to provide technical assistance to states and fund demonstration sites to establish or enhance collaboration across community agencies and courts. Although continuing to provide technical assistance to states should be beneficial, our findings demonstrate that additional guidance is also needed. For example, 38 states reported that additional guidance on requirements for health care providers to notify CPS of substance-affected infants would be extremely or very helpful. Similarly, 37 states reported that additional guidance on developing, implementing, and monitoring plans to ensure the safety and well-being of substance-affected infants would be extremely or very helpful. Overall, given the results of our review, we continue to believe our recommendation is warranted. Effective implementation of our recommendation should help states better implement protections for children.

      "Moreover, DOD commented that it factors in host nation support and burden sharing when preparing budget estimates for Congress. However, DOD does not state whether it will begin to provide Congress future estimates and any underlying assumptions with its budget submission. It is critical that DOD increase congressional visibility into ERI’s future costs and its underlying assumptions to facilitate congressional oversight and reasonably ensure that initiatives can be sustained over the long-term. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, and the Commander, U.S. European Command. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.

GAO staff who made major contributions to this report are listed in Appendix III. The Army and Air Force identified approximately $224 million in unspecified minor military construction and facilities maintenance and repair projects (hereafter, minor construction and repair) that were programmed or obligated for the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) in fiscal years 2015 through 2017. This includes $157 million for minor construction and repair projects identified by the Army and nearly $67 million for minor construction and repair projects identified by the Air Force. According to U.S. European Command officials, Navy and Marine Corps construction projects funded under ERI were either major military construction or exercise-related construction projects. The tables below do not include Navy and Marine Corps exercise-related construction projects. Using the data provided by the military services, we compiled the programmed and obligated funding for these minor construction and repair projects by fiscal year, country, location, and project name in tables 3 and 4.",
      "As a result, DOD is limiting congressional visibility into the resources needed to achieve ERI’s objectives. If DOD does not provide Congress with projections of the future costs of posture initiatives funded under ERI and information on its assumptions pertaining to host nation support and burden sharing, it will continue to impede congressional visibility into the resources that are needed to fully implement these initiatives. Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the subsequent threat of further aggression led DOD to establish and later expand ERI’s objectives and enhance posture in Europe to support a new U.S. strategy toward Russia. DOD has requested funding for these enhancements using its OCO budget; however, the processes DOD uses to develop its OCO budget were not designed to plan for and fund long-term, enduring initiatives such as ERI. By following a separate planning process when funding ERI with OCO, DOD is taking on risk by not reviewing and prioritizing ERI posture plans against other posture initiatives, estimating the costs for sustaining ERI initiatives, and providing Congress with estimates of ERI’s future costs. DOD risks making decisions that lack a strategic vision in comparison to other DOD priorities and may fund initiatives that cannot be sustained over the long term. Furthermore, Congress is likely to face challenges in assessing DOD’s estimated costs for ERI and the affordability of initiatives funded under ERI over the long term. To better ensure that DOD can target resources to its most critical initiatives and establish priorities across its base budget and overseas contingency operations budget, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense prioritize posture initiatives under ERI relative to those funded in its base budget as part of its established posture-planning processes. (Recommendation 1) To better enable decision makers to evaluate the full long-term costs of posture initiatives under ERI, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct EUCOM and the military services to develop estimates for the sustainment costs of prepositioned equipment and other infrastructure projects under ERI and ensure that the services plan for these long-term costs in future budgets.",
      "Additionally, officials said that EUCOM is trying to negotiate burden sharing agreements with host nations; however, it is unclear whether these negotiations will be successful or how any resulting agreements would affect DOD’s future costs. Without comprehensive estimates of the sustainment costs for the prepositioned equipment and major military construction projects in Europe, DOD decision makers have been limited in their ability to evaluate the affordability of these initiatives. Further, in the absence of these estimates, the services have been limited in their ability to plan for costs in future budgets, because they have an incomplete understanding of the magnitude of those costs and of when they are likely to be incurred. The funding plan that DOD submits to Congress for ERI does not contain information about ERI’s future costs. This is in contrast to the way DOD submits its funding plan for its base budget, where DOD provides Congress with cost projections over a 5-year period, by appropriation, leaving Congress with a better understanding of how and when to allocate resources. In reviewing the fiscal year 2018 ERI request, the Director for Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation assessed future costs associated with posture initiatives funded under ERI. We previously reported that DOD was not developing enduring requirements funded through its OCO budget as part of its budget and programming process. Officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation told us that DOD has not been required to provide estimates for future OCO costs for ERI to Congress previously. An official from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) told us that DOD does not plan to provide these future costs to Congress along with its fiscal year 2018 ERI budget submission. Additionally, in preparing its posture requirements, EUCOM did not identify assumptions regarding host nation and NATO burden sharing.",
      "For example, officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy said that DOD has submitted a request to the NATO Security Investment Programmé for $200 million in funding to build a facility in Poland to store Army equipment. Officials told us that, as a result, this construction project was identified as a lesser priority in EUCOM’s fiscal year 2018 request for funding. A senior Army officer told us that completion of a facility in Poland was critical to its plans in Europe. Officials from the U.S. Mission to NATO told us that as of July 2016 NATO had approved funding to complete preliminary architectural and engineering design for this project. Officials expect additional funding will be made available in July 2017 to complete final design and site preparation and the full cost of the project will be approved in early 2019. However, these officials noted that additional funding beyond what has been approved by NATO may be required to meet U.S.-specific requirements. Similarly, EUCOM officials said that they are working to identify opportunities to defray future costs through host nation contributions, but it is unclear how much funding—if any—host nations will provide moving forward. Congress has expressed interest in knowing the future costs of enduring activities being funded through DOD’s OCO budget. The Senate Appropriations Committee’s report accompanying a bill for DOD’s fiscal year 2015 appropriations stated that the committee does not have an understanding of enduring activities funded by the OCO budget. The committee further noted that there is a potential for risk in continuing to fund non-contingency-related activities through the OCO budget. Both GAO’s and other federal standards emphasize that agencies should provide complete and reliable information on the costs of programs externally, so that decision makers can make informed decisions when allocating resources. DOD has not provided Congress projections of future costs for posture initiatives funded under ERI because it is reviewing those requirements outside of its budget and programming processes, and DOD officials said that the department is not required to provide this information.",

The objectives of this report were to (1) compare the reported costs of a specific United Nations (UN) peacekeeping operation to the estimated costs of a hypothetical, comparable operation implemented by the United States; (2) identify factors that affect cost differences; and (3) identify stakeholder views on the relative strengths of UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations. To compare the reported costs of a specific UN peacekeeping operation to the estimated costs of a hypothetical, comparable operation implemented by the United States, we selected the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) as a case study. We compared the reported UN expenditures for MINUSCA, which included both military and civilian components, with estimated costs for a hypothetical U.S. operation with a similar level of military and civilian personnel. Our comparison covers a total of 3 years and 3 months—from MINUSCA’s establishment in April 2014 through June 30, 2017, the end of UN fiscal year 2017. We selected MINUSCA because it is in sub-Saharan Africa, where most UN peacekeeping operations established since 2003 have taken place, and has a typical scope and budget compared to other UN peacekeeping operations in sub-Saharan Africa, according to U.S. and UN officials."

      "The program is open to public and private schools. A reimbursable meal requires compliance with federal school nutrition standards, which have changed throughout the history of the program based on nutritional science and children's nutritional needs. Food items not served as a complete meal meeting nutrition standards (e.g., a la carte offerings) are not reimbursable meals, and therefore are not eligible for federal per-meal, per-snack reimbursements. Following rulemaking to implement provisions in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-296 ), USDA updated the nutrition standards for reimbursable meals in January 2012 (see \" Nutrition Standards \" for more information). Schools serving meals that meet the updated nutrition standards are eligible for an increased reimbursement of 6 cents per lunch. USDA-FNS administers the school meals programs federally, and state agencies (typically state departments of education) oversee and transmit reimbursements through agreements with school food authorities (SFAs) (typically local educational agencies (LEAs); usually these are school districts). Figure 1 provides an overview of the roles and relationships between these levels of government. There is a cost-sharing requirement for the programs, which amounts to a contribution of approximately $200 million from the states. There also are states that choose to supplement federal reimbursements with their own state reimbursements. The school meals programs and related funding do not serve only low-income children. All students can receive a meal at a NSLP- or SBP-participating school, but how much the child pays for the meal and/or how much of a federal reimbursement the state receives will depend largely on whether the child qualifies for a \"free,\" \"reduced-price,\" or \"paid\" (i.e., advertised price) meal. Both NSLP and SBP use the same household income eligibility criteria and categorical eligibility rules. States and schools receive the largest reimbursements for free meals, smaller reimbursements for reduced-price meals, and the smallest (but still some federal financial support) for the full-price meals.",
      "The term child nutrition programs refers to several U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS) programs that provide food to children in institutional settings. The largest are the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP), which subsidize free, reduced-price, and full-price meals in participating schools. Also operating in schools, the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program provides funding for fruit and vegetable snacks in participating elementary schools, and the Special Milk Program provides support for milk in schools that do not participate in NSLP or SBP. Other child nutrition programs include the Child and Adult Care Food Program, which provides meals and snacks in child care and after-school settings, and the Summer Food Service Program, which provides food during the summer months. The child nutrition programs were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA, P.L. 111-296 ). On September 30, 2015, some of the authorities created or extended by the HHFKA expired. However, these expirations had a minimal impact on program operations, as the child nutrition programs have continued with funding provided by annual appropriations acts. In the 114 th Congress, lawmakers began but did not complete child nutrition reauthorization, which refers to the process of reauthorizing and potentially making changes to multiple permanent statutes—the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, the Child Nutrition Act, and sometimes Section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935. Both committees of jurisdiction—the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce—reported reauthorization legislation ( S. 3136 and H.R. 5003 , respectively). This legislation died at the end of the 114 th Congress, as is the case for any bill that has not yet passed both chambers and been sent to the President at the end of a Congress. There were no significant child nutrition reauthorization efforts in the 115 th Congress; however, 2018 farm bill proposals and the final enacted bill included a few provisions related to child nutrition programs.",
      "However, the separate direct federal payments for administrative/operating costs (\"State Administrative Expenses,\" discussed in the \" Related Programs, Initiatives, and Support Activities \" section) are limited. In addition to the open-ended, appropriated entitlement funds summarized above, the child nutrition programs' funding also includes certain other mandatory funding and a limited amount of discretionary funding. Some of the activities discussed in \" Related Programs, Initiatives, and Support Activities ,\" such as Team Nutrition, are provided for with discretionary funding. Aside from the annually appropriated funding, the child nutrition programs are also supported by certain permanent appropriations and transfers. Notably, funding for the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program is funded by a transfer from USDA's Section 32 program, a permanent appropriation of 30% of the previous year's customs receipts. Federal subsidies do not necessarily cover the full cost of the meals and snacks offered by providers. States and localities help cover program costs, as do children's families by paying charges for nonfree or reduced-price meals/snacks. There is a nonfederal cost-sharing requirement for the school meals programs (discussed below), and some states supplement school funding through additional state per-meal reimbursements or other prescribed financing arrangements. Subsequent sections of this report delve into the details of how each of the child nutrition programs support the service of meals and snacks in institutional settings; first, it is useful to take a broader perspective of primary program elements. Table 1 is a top-level look at the different programs that displays distinguishing characteristics (what meals are provided, in what settings, to what ages) and recent program spending. Other relevant CRS reports in this area include CRS In Focus IF10266, An Introduction to Child Nutrition Reauthorization CRS Report R45486, Child Nutrition Programs: Current Issues CRS Report R42353, Domestic Food Assistance: Summary of Programs CRS Report R41354, Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization: P.L. 111-296 (summarizes the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010)",
      "In FY2017, the At-Risk Afterschool program served a total of approximately 242.6 million free meals and snacks to a daily average of more than 1.7 million children. Federal child nutrition laws authorize and program funding supports a range of additional programs, initiatives, and activities. Through State Administrative Expenses funding, states are entitled to federal grants to help cover administrative and oversight/monitoring costs associated with child nutrition programs. The national amount each year is equal to about 2% of child nutrition reimbursements. The majority of this money is allocated to states based on their share of spending on the covered programs; about 15% is allocated under a discretionary formula granting each state additional amounts for CACFP, commodity distribution, and Administrative Review efforts. In addition, states receive payments for their role in overseeing summer programs (about 2.5% of their summer program aid). States are free to apportion their federal administrative expense payments among child nutrition initiatives (including commodity distribution activities) as they see fit, and appropriated funding is available to states for two years. State Administrative Expense spending in FY2017 totaled approximately $279 million. Team Nutrition is a USDA-FNS program that includes a variety of school meals initiatives around nutrition education and the nutritional content of the foods children eat in schools. This includes Team Nutrition Training Grants, which provide funding to state agencies for training and technical assistance, such as help implementing USDA's nutrition requirements and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. From 2004 to 2018, Team Nutrition also included the HealthierUS Schools Challenge (HUSSC), which originated in the 2004 reauthorization of the Child Nutrition Act. HUSSC was a voluntary certification initiative designed to recognize schools that have created a healthy school environment through the promotion of nutrition and physical activity.",
      "Some schools offer (and anti-hunger groups have encouraged) models of breakfast service that can result in greater SBP participation, such as Breakfast in the Classroom, where meals are delivered in the classroom; \"grab and go\" carts, where students receive a bagged breakfast that they bring to class, or serving breakfast later in the day in middle and high schools. Unlike NSLP, commodity food assistance is not a formal part of SBP funding; however, commodities provided through NSLP may be used for school breakfasts as well. In addition to the school meals programs discussed above, other federal child nutrition programs provide federal subsidies and commodity food assistance for schools and other institutions that offer meals and snacks to children in early childhood, summer, and after-school settings. This assistance is provided to (1) schools and other governmental institutions, (2) private for-profit and nonprofit child care centers, (3) family/group day care homes, and (4) nongovernmental institutions/organizations that offer outside-of-school programs for children. (Although this report focuses on the programs that serve children, one child nutrition program (CACFP) also serves day care centers for chronically impaired adults and elderly persons under the same general per-meal/snack subsidy terms.) The programs in the sections to follow serve comparatively fewer children and spend comparatively fewer federal funds than the school meal programs. CACFP subsidizes meals and snacks served in early childhood, day care, and after-school settings. CACFP provides subsidies for meals and snacks served at participating nonresidential child care centers, family day care homes, and (to a lesser extent) adult day care centers. The program also provides assistance for meals served at after-school programs. CACFP reimbursements are available for meals and snacks served to children age 12 or under, migrant children age 15 or under, children with disabilities of any age, and, in the case of adult care centers, chronically impaired and elderly adults."

    "question": "A low hazard dam, which has not undergone an independent consultant inspection in the past 10 years, is proposed for alteration of its spillway. According to FERC's regulations and guidelines, the dam's original design information, including assumptions and calculations used to determine the dam's type and size, is no longer available. FERC staff have reviewed the dam's most recent hydrology studies within the past 5 years, but the studies were conducted by FERC staff, not an independent consultant. The dam's safety risks are deemed minimal by FERC staff, but the licensee proposes to modify the dam's operation to increase its water storage capacity. Which of the following is a necessary condition for FERC to request an engineering study for the low hazard dam?",
    "choices": [
      "A) The dam's age exceeds 20 years",
      "B) The dam's original design information is no longer available",
      "C) FERC staff have reviewed the study's most recent hydrology studies within the last 2 years",
      "D) The dam's safety risks are deemed minimal by FERC staff"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "Once developed, engineering studies we reviewed often remained in effect for a number of years, until FERC or the licensee and its consultant determined an update was required. For example, we found that the hydrology studies were 20 years or older for 17 of the 42 dams in our review, including for 9 of the 16 high hazard dams in our sample. FERC’s Engineering Guidelines states that studies should be updated as appropriate. For example, FERC’s Engineering Guidelines on hydrology studies state that previously accepted flood studies are not required to be reevaluated unless it is determined that a re-analysis is warranted. The Guidelines notes that FERC or the consultant may consider reanalyzing the study for several reasons, including if they identify (1) significant errors in the original study; (2) new data that may significantly alter previous study results; or (3) significant changes in the conditions of the drainage basin. FERC staff and consultants we interviewed stated that age alone is not a primary criterion to update or replace studies and that studies should be updated as needed depending on several factors including age, new or additional data, and professional judgment. Consultants we interviewed identified some limitations that can affect their ability to develop engineering studies for a dam. For example, they noted that some dams may lack original design information, used prior to construction of the dam, which includes the assumptions and calculations used to determine the type and size of dam, the amount of water storage capacity, and information on the pre-construction site geology and earthquake potential. FERC officials estimated that for a large percentage of the dams they relicense, the original information is no longer available. For example, according to the report from the independent forensic team investigating the Oroville Dam incident and as previously noted, some design drawings and construction records for the dam’s spillway could not be located and some other documents that were available were not included in the most recent independent consultant inspection report submitted to FERC.",
      "In general, for the dams we reviewed, we found that FERC staff reviewed engineering studies for dams subject to independent consultant inspections (which are typically high or significant hazard dams) more frequently than those engineering studies associated with dams for which FERC does not require an independent consultant inspection (typically low hazard dams). For example, we found FERC staff had reviewed the most recent hydrology studies for all 22 high and significant hazard dams in our sample subject to independent consultant inspections within the last 6 years and documented their analysis. According to FERC officials, for dams not subject to an independent consultant inspection, FERC staff review engineering studies on an as needed basis, depending on whether the underlying assumptions and information from the previous studies are still relevant. For example, for the 20 dams in our study not subject to an independent consultant inspection, we found that most (15) of these studies were reviewed by FERC within the past 10 years, usually during the project’s relicensing. Multiple levels of supervisory review. As part of FERC’s quality control and internal oversight process, multiple FERC staff are to review the studies produced by the licensee and its consultant, with the number of successive reviews proportional to the complexity or importance of the study, according to FERC officials. FERC’s Operating Manual establishes the general procedure for the review of engineering studies. To begin the review process, the staff assigned to a dam is to review the engineering study and prepares an internal memo on its findings; that memo is then to be reviewed for accuracy and completeness by both a regional office Branch Chief, and the Regional Engineer. If necessary, Washington, D.C., headquarters office staff are to review and approve the final memo. Upon completion of review, FERC staff are to provide a letter to the licensee indicating any particular areas where additional information is needed or where more studies are needed to evaluate the dam’s performance.",
      "A similar and proactive approach based on analysis of common deficiencies across the portfolio of dams under FERC’s authority could also help to identify any safety risks that may not have been targeted during the inspections of individual dams and prior to a safety incident. As directed by FERC, licensees and their consultants develop and review, or update, various engineering studies related to dam performance to help ensure their dams meet FERC requirements and remain safe. FERC regulations and guidelines describe the types and frequency of studies and analyses required based on dams’ hazard classifications. For all high hazard and some significant hazard dams, existing studies are to be reviewed by each licensee’s consultants every 5 years, as part of the independent consultant inspection and accompanying potential failure mode analysis. According to FERC officials, for those significant hazard dams that do not require an independent consultant inspection and for low hazard dams, FERC’s regulations and guidelines do not require any studies, but in practice FERC directs many licensees to conduct them. FERC also may request engineering studies in response to dam safety incidents at other projects, or engage a board of consultants to oversee the completion of a study. For example, as previously noted, following the Oroville Dam incident in 2017, FERC requested a special assessment of all dams with spillways similar to the failed spillway at the Oroville Dam. To develop these studies, all six of the consultants we interviewed stated that they follow guidelines provided by FERC and other dam safety agencies. Specifically, they stated that they use FERC’s Engineering Guidelines, which provide engineering principles to guide the development and review of engineering studies. In recognition of the unique characteristics of each dam, including its construction, geography, and applicable loading conditions, the Guidelines provides consultants with flexibility to apply engineering judgment, and as a result, the approach that licensees and their consultants use and the focus of their reviews of engineering studies may vary across regions or projects.",
      "According to FERC staff, the safety review for relicensing is generally a summary of prior safety and inspection information, rather than an analysis of new safety information, unless the licensee proposes a change to the operation or structure. FERC’s review during relicensing for the high hazard and significant hazard dams we reviewed was generally consistent with its guidance and safety memo template, though the extent of its review of low hazard dams varied. (See fig. 3.) For example, for the 22 high and significant hazard dams we reviewed, the safety relicensing memos followed the template and nearly all included summaries of hydrology studies, stability analyses, prior FERC inspections, and applicable independent consultant reports. For the 20 low hazard dams, FERC staff noted that some requirements in the template are not applicable or have been exempted and therefore were not reviewed during relicensing. While low hazard dams were more inconsistently reviewed during relicensing, FERC staff also noted that there has been a recent emphasis to more closely review, replace, or conduct engineering studies, such as the stability study, for low hazard dams during relicensing. Moreover, FERC staff told us that the safety risks associated with these dams are minimal, as the failure of a low hazard dam, by definition, does not pose a threat to human life or economic activity. According to FERC staff, if a licensee proposed altering the dam or its operations in any way as part of its application for a new license, FERC staff would review the proposed change and may recommend adding articles to the new license prior to its issuance to ensure dam safety. FERC officials noted that, as part of their review, any structural or operational changes proposed by the licensee during relicensing are reviewed by FERC. These officials also noted that FERC generally recommends modifications to the licensees’ proposed changes prior to their approval and inclusion in the new license. However, FERC officials noted that, in some cases, additional information is needed prior to approving the structural or operational change to ensure there are no risks posed by the changes."

      "To determine the extent to which DHS and the Secret Service had implemented the first selected practice, we analyzed relevant program management and governance documentation for IITT’s Enabling Capabilities program, and Multi-Level Security, Uniformed Division Resource Management System, and Events Management projects. In particular, we analyzed acquisition program baselines, DHS acquisition decision event memorandums, artifacts from DHS and Secret Service program oversight reviews, cost monitoring reports, program integrated master schedules, and program status briefings, and compared this documentation to the selected practice. We also interviewed Secret Service OCIO officials regarding the Secret Service’s and DHS’s efforts to monitor the IITT investment’s performance and progress. To determine the extent to which the Secret Service had implemented the second selected practice related to measuring and monitoring agile projects on agile metrics (i.e., velocity, development progression, product quality, and post-deployment user satisfaction), we obtained and analyzed agile-related documentation for the two projects that the Secret Service was implementing using an agile methodology—Uniformed Division Resource Management System and Events Management. Specifically, to determine the extent to which the Secret Service was measuring and monitoring these two projects on metrics for velocity and development progression, we obtained and analyzed documentation, such as sprint burndown charts and monthly program status reports, and compared it to the selected practice. In addition, the agile metrics for product quality and post-deployment user satisfaction were only applicable to projects that had been deployed to users. As such, these metrics were applicable to the Uniformed Division Resource Management System (which the Secret Service had deployed to users) and were not applicable to Events Management (which the Secret Service had not yet deployed to users, as of early May 2018).",
      "We therefore obtained and analyzed documentation demonstrating that Secret Service OCIO measured product defects for the Uniformed Division Resource Management System. We also requested documentation demonstrating that OCIO had measured and monitored post-deployment user satisfaction for this project, including via a survey. OCIO officials stated that they had not conducted such a survey and were unable to provide documentation demonstrating they had measured post- deployment user satisfaction for the Uniformed Division Resource Management System. To assess the reliability of the cost, schedule, and agile-related data that were in DHS and the Secret Service’s program management and governance documentation for the IITT investment, we (1) analyzed related documentation and assessed the data against existing agency records to identify consistency in the information, and (2) examined the data for obvious outliers, incomplete, or unusual entries. We determined that the data in these documents were sufficiently reliable for our purpose, which was to evaluate the extent to which DHS and the Secret Service had implemented processes for monitoring the IITT investment’s performance and progress. We conducted this performance audit from May 2017 to November 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. As of June 2018, the Secret Service’s Information Integration and Technology Transformation (IITT) investment included two programs (one of which included three projects) and one project that had capabilities that were in planning or development and modernization, as described below: Enabling Capabilities. This program is intended to, among other things, (1) modernize and enhance the Secret Service’s information technology (IT) network infrastructure, including increasing bandwidth and improving the speed and reliability of the Secret Service’s IT system performance; (2) enhance cybersecurity to protect against potential intrusions and viruses; and (3) provide counterintelligence and data mining capabilities to improve officials’ ability to perform the Secret Service’s investigative mission.",
      "This documentation included acquisition program baselines, systems engineering life cycle tailoring plans, and systems engineering life cycle technical review briefings and completion letters. We then compared the documentation against the five selected systems engineering life cycle oversight responsibilities (responsibilities 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). We also obtained and analyzed documentation related to the CIO’s oversight of two projects that the Secret Service was implementing using an agile methodology—Uniformed Division Resource Management System and Events Management. Specifically, we obtained and assessed documentation of (1) the CIO’s approval for these projects to be implemented using an agile methodology and (2) the agile development metrics that the CIO established for each of these projects. We then compared this documentation to the three agile development-related component-level CIO responsibilities (responsibilities 10, 11, and 12). Further, to determine the extent to which the Secret Service CIO had established an IT acquisition (i.e., contract) review process that enabled component and DHS review of component contracts that contain IT (which is part of responsibility 2), we first asked Secret Service officials to provide us with a list of all new, unclassified IT contracts that the component awarded between October 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017. The Secret Service officials provided a list of 54 contracts. We validated that these were contracts for IT or IT services by: (1) searching for them in the Federal Procurement Data System – Next Generation; (2) identifying their associated product or service codes, as reported in that system; and (3) determining whether those codes were included in the universe of 79 IT product or service codes identified by the Category Management Leadership Council. In validating the list of 54 contracts provided by the Secret Service, we determined that 5 of the contracts were not associated with an IT product or service code. As such, we removed those contracts from the list.",
      "Set modular outcomes and target measures to monitor the progress in achieving agile implementation for IT programs and/or projects within their component. Consistent with DHS policy, the Secret Service CIO has set modular outcomes and target measures to monitor the progress of two IITT projects that the component is implementing using an agile methodology—Uniformed Division Resource Management System and Events Management. For example, the modular outcomes set for these projects included measuring planned and actual burndown (i.e., the number of user stories completed). In addition, the projects were to measure their velocity (i.e., the rate of work completed) for each sprint (i.e., a set period of time during which the development team is expected to complete tasks related to developing a piece of working software). However, the modular outcomes and target measures did not include product quality or post-deployment user satisfaction, although such measures are leading practices for managing agile projects. According to Secret Service OCIO officials, the component does not mandate the specific metrics that its agile projects are to use; instead, each project is to determine the metrics based on stakeholder requirements and unique project characteristics. The officials further stated that these metrics are to be documented in an acquisition program baseline and program management plan; this baseline and program management plan are then to be approved by the CIO. To its credit, the component’s one agile project that, as of May 2018, had deployed its system to users—the Uniformed Division Resource Management System—did measure product quality. OCIO officials also stated that they regularly receive verbal, undocumented feedback from users on the system and they plan to conduct a documented user satisfaction survey on this system by September 2018. Nevertheless, without ensuring that product quality and post- deployment user satisfaction metrics are included in the modular outcomes and target measures that the CIO sets for monitoring agile projects, the Secret Service lacks assurance that the Events Management project or other future agile projects will measure product quality or post-deployment user satisfaction."

For example, HIPAA is limited to \"protected health information\" and GLBA governs \"financial information\" that is personally identifiable but not publicly available. By contrast, GDPR and CCPA regulate all \"personal\" information—a term defined in both laws as information that is associated with a particular individual or is capable of being associated with an individual. Some federal data proposals would apply a similar scope to those of the GDPR and CCPA. If enacted, such broad data protection laws have the potential to create multiple layers of federal data protection requirements: (1) general data protection requirements for \"personal\" information and (2) sector-specific requirements for data regulated by the existing \"patchwork\" of data protection laws. Other legislative proposals have sought to avoid dual layers of regulations by stating that the proposed data protection requirements would not apply to individuals or entities covered by certain existing federal privacy laws. Agency enforcement is another key issue to consider when crafting any future federal data protection legislation. As discussed, under the current patchwork of federal data protection laws, there are multiple federal agencies responsible for enforcing the myriad federal statutory protections, such as the FTC, CFPB, FCC, and HHS. Of these agencies, the FTC is often viewed—by industry representatives, privacy advocates, and FTC commissioners themselves —as the appropriate primary enforcer of any future national data protection legislation, given its significant privacy experience. There are, however, several relevant legal constraints on the FTC's enforcement authority. First, the FTC generally lacks the ability to issue fines for first-time offenses. In UDAP enforcement actions, the FTC may issue civil penalties only in certain limited circumstances, such as when a person violates a consent decree or a cease and desist order.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fills in some of the statutory gaps by enforcing the federal prohibition against unfair and deceptive data protection practices. But no single federal law comprehensively regulates the collection and use of personal data. In contrast to the \"patchwork\" nature of federal law, some state and foreign governments have enacted more comprehensive data protection legislation. Some analysts suggest these laws, which include the European Union's (EU's) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and state laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), will create increasingly overlapping and uneven data protection regimes. This fragmented legal landscape coupled with concerns that existing federal laws are inadequate has led many stakeholders to argue that the federal government should assume a larger role in data protection policy. However, at present, there is no consensus as to what, if any, role the federal government should play, and any legislative efforts at data protection are likely to implicate unique legal concerns such as preemption, standing, and First Amendment rights, among other issues. This report examines the current U.S. legal landscape governing data protection, contrasting the current patchwork of federal data protection laws with the more comprehensive regulatory models in the CCPA and GDPR. The report also examines potential legal considerations for the 116th Congress should it consider crafting more comprehensive federal data protection legislation. The report lastly contains an Appendix , which contains a table summarizing the federal data protection laws discussed in the report. Historically, the common law in the United States had little need to protect privacy—as one commentator has observed, \"[s]olitude was readily available in colonial America.\" Although common law had long protected against eavesdropping and trespass, these protections said little to nothing about individual rights to privacy, per se. Over time, gradual changes in the technological and social environment caused a shift in the law."

    "documentation": [
      "Officials in our selected states said information on total Medicaid payments for hospital-based NAS services was not readily available. Several DRGs are typically used to bill Medicaid for services provided to infants. However, these codes alone cannot provide an accurate estimate of Medicaid payments for NAS treatment services because the codes are not used exclusively for NAS. For example, according to some health care providers we interviewed, two DRG codes that may be used to bill Medicaid and other payers for NAS treatment services are 791 (prematurity with major problems) and 793 (full term neonate with major problems). However, these codes could be used to bill for over 2,000 diagnoses—for example, pneumonia or measles. One state official said that while they could provide us with information on Medicaid payments for these infants, they could not parse out the costs by diagnosis codes, such as those related to NAS. Thus, estimates of total Medicaid payments based only on DRG codes likely overstate the amount paid for NAS hospital-based services. Officials from two of the four selected states told us that their state has a public health surveillance system that tracks the incidence of infants diagnosed with NAS; however, the surveillance systems do not capture financial information, including Medicaid payments for NAS. At our request, one of the states cross-referenced their surveillance and Medicaid data and estimated that in 2016, their state Medicaid program spent over $22 million to treat 1,565 infants with NAS. While selected states generally could not provide information on total Medicaid payments for infants with NAS, some hospitals in our selected states were able to generate this information at our request using diagnosis codes that they identified as related to NAS from hospital claims data. Six of our selected eight hospitals reported that in calendar year 2016, the average Medicaid payment for treating infants with NAS ranged from about $1,500 to about $20,200 per infant per stay.",
      "Medicaid pays for NAS treatment services provided in the non-hospital settings we identified in certain states, according to CMS officials and other stakeholders we spoke with, but generally pays for these services separately, in contrast with the single bundled payment paid to hospitals. State officials and health care providers in the non-hospital settings we examined described various ways in which Medicaid covered services they provided to treat infants with NAS. For example: Outpatient follow-up clinic in Vermont. State officials and staff at this facility told us that the Vermont Medicaid program pays for an infant’s outpatient physician visits using a fee-for-service payment schedule. They added that the Vermont Medicaid program also pays for the infant’s medication used in pharmacologic treatment and explained that the pharmacy that dispenses the medication bills Medicaid for these services. Neonatal withdrawal center in Washington. Health care providers at this facility told us that the Washington Medicaid program or their contracted managed care plans pay for physician visits using a fee- for-service payment schedule, noting that the facility decided to stop billing Medicaid for medical supplies because of the low reimbursement. Additionally, these providers suggested that because the facility does not meet the Medicaid standards required for receiving payment for hospital inpatient, nursing, or other covered facility services, the facility is ineligible to receive Medicaid payment for the costs of room and board. These providers said that they receive funding for the cost of these services through state appropriations, foster care payments, city contracts, grants, and private donations. Neonatal withdrawal center in West Virginia. State officials and health care providers at this facility told us that West Virginia pays for NAS services through two mechanisms, depending on whether the infant is in foster care. Specifically, if the infant is in foster care, the facility receives a bundled payment from the state Medicaid program and the Bureau of Children and Families."

What is the primary purpose of HUD's proposed procedures for determining when lead paint hazard compliance efforts are no longer sufficient and enforcement decisions are needed, particularly in cases where a PHA has failed to address lead paint hazards in HUD-assisted housing units with high levels of lead exposure, such as those with children who have tested positive for elevated blood lead levels?",

      "Reporting. HUD has not reported on its lead efforts as required since 1997. Title X includes annual and biennial reporting requirements for HUD. Staff from HUD’s Lead Office and General Counsel told us that in 1998 the agency agreed with the congressional committees of jurisdiction that HUD could satisfy this reporting requirement by including the required information in its annual performance reports. Lead Office staff told us HUD’s recent annual performance reports do not contain specific information required by law and that HUD has not issued other publicly available reports that contain the Title X reporting requirements. Title X requires HUD to annually provide Congress information on its progress in implementing the lead grant programs; a summary of studies looking at the incidence of lead poisoning in children living in HUD-assisted housing; the results of any required lead technical studies; and estimates of federal funds spent on lead hazard evaluation and reduction in HUD-assisted housing. As previously stated, the annual performance reports have provided information on the number of housing units made lead-safe through the agency’s lead grant programs, but not through the voucher or public housing programs. In March 2018, Lead Office staff told us HUD plans to submit separate reports on the agency’s lead effort, covering the Title X reporting requirements, starting in fiscal year 2019. By HUD complying with Title X statutory reporting requirements, Congress and the public will be in a position to better know the progress HUD is making toward ensuring that housing is lead-safe. Lead exposure can cause serious, irreversible cognitive damage that can impair a child for life. Through its lead grant programs and oversight of lead paint regulations, HUD is helping to address lead paint hazards in housing. However, our review identified specific areas where HUD could improve the effectiveness of its efforts to identify and address lead paint hazards and protect children in low-income housing from lifelong health problems: Documenting and evaluating grant processes.",
      "However, OFO’s fiscal years 2015–2017 internal memorandums on monitoring and oversight guidance for HUD field offices did not contain detailed procedures, including time frames or criteria HUD staff would use to determine when to consider whether a more formal enforcement action might be warranted. Additionally, Lead Office staff said if efforts to bring a PHA into compliance are unsuccessful, the Lead Office would work in conjunction with PIH and HUD’s Office of General Counsel’s Departmental Enforcement Center to determine if an enforcement action is needed, such as withholding or delaying funds from a PHA or imposing civil money penalties on a PHA. Lead Office staff also told us that instead of imposing a fine on a PHA, HUD would rather work with the PHA to resolve the lead paint hazard. However, the Lead Office provided no documentation detailing the specific steps or time frames HUD staff would follow to determine when a noncompliance case is escalated to the Office of General Counsel. In a March 2018 report to Congress, HUD noted that children continued to test positive for lead in HUD-assisted housing in 2017. In the same report, HUD notes PIH and the Lead Office will continue to work with PHAs to ensure compliance with lead paint regulations. By adopting procedures that clearly describe when lead paint hazard compliance efforts are no longer sufficient and enforcement decisions are needed, HUD can better keep PHAs accountable in a consistent and timely manner. The standard HUD uses to identify children with elevated blood lead levels and initiate lead hazard control activities in its rental assistance aligns with the health guideline set by CDC in 2012. HUD also uses CDC’s health guideline in its lead grant programs. In HUD’s January 2017 amendment to the Lead Safe Housing Rule, HUD made its standard for lead in a child’s blood more stringent by lowering it from 20 micrograms to 5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood, matching CDC’s health guideline (i.e., blood lead reference value)."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "Managing the growth and training of those new workforces while maintaining the current standard of quality and efficiency would represent the most significant industrywide challenge. In addition, industry and Navy sources indicate that as much as $4 billion would need to be invested in the physical infrastructure of the shipyards to achieve the higher production rates required under the [notional] 15-year and 20-year [buildup scenarios examined by CBO]. Less investment would be needed for the [notional] 25-year or 30-year [buildup scenarios examined by CBO]. A January 13, 2017, press report states the following: The Navy's production lines are hot and the work to prepare them for the possibility of building out a much larger fleet would be manageable, the service's head of acquisition said Thursday. From a logistics perspective, building the fleet from its current 274 ships to 355, as recommended in the Navy's newest force structure assessment in December, would be straightforward, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition Sean Stackley told reporters at the Surface Navy Association's annual symposium. \"By virtue of maintaining these hot production lines, frankly, over the last eight years, our facilities are in pretty good shape,\" Stackley said. \"In fact, if you talked to industry, they would say we're underutilizing the facilities that we have.\" The areas where the Navy would likely have to adjust \"tooling\" to answer demand for a larger fleet would likely be in Virginia-class attack submarines and large surface combatants, the DDG-51 guided missile destroyers—two ship classes likely to surge if the Navy gets funding to build to 355 ships, he said. \"Industry's going to have to go out and procure special tooling associated with going from current production rates to a higher rate, but I would say that's easily done,\" he said. Another key, Stackley said, is maintaining skilled workers—both the builders in the yards and the critical supply-chain vendors who provide major equipment needed for ship construction.",
      "Unlike Electric Boat, Bath Iron Works and NASSCO are able to support increased demand without a significant increase in resources..... Bath Iron Works is well positioned to support the Administration's announced goal of increasing the size of the Navy fleet to 355 ships. For BIW that would mean increasing the total current procurement rate of two DDG 51s per year to as many as four DDGs per year, allocated equally between BIW and HII. This is the same rate that the surface combatant industrial base sustained over the first decade of full rate production of the DDG 51 Class (1989-1999).... No significant capital investment in new facilities is required to accommodate delivering two DDGs per year. However, additional funding will be required to train future shipbuilders and maintain equipment. Current hiring and training processes support the projected need, and have proven to be successful in the recent past. BIW has invested significantly in its training programs since 2014 with the restart of the DDG 51 program and given these investments and the current market in Maine, there is little concern of meeting the increase in resources required under the projected plans. A predictable and sustainable Navy workload is essential to justify expanding hiring/training programs. BIW would need the Navy's commitment that the Navy's plan will not change before it would proceed with additional hiring and training to support increased production. BIW's supply chain is prepared to support a procurement rate increase of up to four DDG 51s per year for the DDG 51 Program. BIW has long-term purchasing agreements in place for all major equipment and material for the DDG 51 Program. These agreements provide for material lead time and pricing, and are not constrained by the number of ships ordered in a year. BIW confirmed with all of its critical suppliers that they can support this increased procurement rate.... The Navy's Force Structure Assessment calls for three additional ESBs. Additionally, NASSCO has been asked by the Navy and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to evaluate its ability to increase the production rate of T-AOs to two ships per year.",
      "Industrial Base Ability The U.S. shipbuilding industrial base has some unused capacity to take on increased Navy shipbuilding work, particularly for certain kinds of surface ships, and its capacity could be increased further over time to support higher Navy shipbuilding rates. Navy shipbuilding rates could not be increased steeply across the board overnight—time (and investment) would be needed to hire and train additional workers and increase production facilities at shipyards and supplier firms, particularly for supporting higher rates of submarine production. Depending on their specialties, newly hired workers could be initially less productive per unit of time worked than more experienced workers. Some parts of the shipbuilding industrial base, such as the submarine construction industrial base, could face more challenges than others in ramping up to the higher production rates required to build the various parts of the 355-ship fleet. Over a period of a few to several years, with investment and management attention, Navy shipbuilding could ramp up to higher rates for achieving a 355-ship fleet over a period of 20-30 years. An April 2017 CBO report stated that all seven shipyards [currently involved in building the Navy's major ships] would need to increase their workforces and several would need to make improvements to their infrastructure in order to build ships at a faster rate. However, certain sectors face greater obstacles in constructing ships at faster rates than others: Building more submarines to meet the goals of the 2016 force structure assessment would pose the greatest challenge to the shipbuilding industry. Increasing the number of aircraft carriers and surface combatants would pose a small to moderate challenge to builders of those vessels. Finally, building more amphibious ships and combat logistics and support ships would be the least problematic for the shipyards. The workforces across those yards would need to increase by about 40 percent over the next 5 to 10 years.",
      "And, he suggested, it would help to avoid budget cuts and other events that would force workforce layoffs. \"We're already prepared to ramp up,\" he said. \"In certain cases, that means not laying off the skilled workforce we want to retain.\" A January 17, 2017, press report states the following: Building stable designs with active production lines is central to the Navy's plan to grow to 355 ships. \"if you look at the 355-ship number, and you study the ship classes (desired), the big surge is in attack submarines and large surface combatants, which today are DDG-51 (destroyers),\" the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Sean Stackley, told reporters at last week's Surface Navy Association conference. Those programs have proven themselves reliable performers both at sea and in the shipyards. From today's fleet of 274 ships, \"we're on an irreversible path to 308 by 2021. Those ships are already in construction,\" said Stackley. \"To go from there to 355, virtually all those ships are currently in production, with some exceptions: Ohio Replacement, (we) just got done the Milestone B there (to move from R&D into detailed design); and then upgrades to existing platforms. So we have hot production lines that will take us to that 355-ship Navy.\" A January 24, 2017, press report states the following: Navy officials say a recently determined plan to increase its fleet size by adding more new submarines, carriers and destroyers is \"executable\" and that early conceptual work toward this end is already underway.... Although various benchmarks will need to be reached in order for this new plan to come to fruition, such as Congressional budget allocations, Navy officials do tell Scout Warrior that the service is already working—at least in concept—on plans to vastly enlarge the fleet. Findings from this study are expected to inform an upcoming 2018 Navy Shipbuilding Plan, service officials said. A January 12, 2017, press report states the following: Brian Cuccias, president of Ingalls Shipbuilding [a shipyard owned by Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) that builds Navy destroyers and amphibious ships as well as Coast Guard cutters], said Ingalls, which is currently building 10 ships for four Navy and Coast Guard programs at its 800-acre facility in Pascagoula, Miss., could build more because it is using only 70 to 75 percent of its capacity."

State plans remain in effect for the duration of states’ participation in the grant program; if modifications are needed, these must be submitted. In addition to state plans, states are required to submit to HHS an annual data report providing information on agency decisions made in response to referrals of child abuse and neglect, as well as preventive services provided to families, among other things. CAPTA requires state governors to provide a series of assurances in their state plans. Since 2003, governors have had to provide an assurance that states have in effect and are enforcing a state law or program that includes policies and procedures to address the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance abuse or displaying withdrawal symptoms at birth. Under states’ policies and procedures, health care providers are required to notify CPS of such infants. Governors must also assure that a plan of safe care is developed for these infants. Although CAPTA does not define “plans of safe care,” for the purposes of this report we define them as plans to ensure the safety and well-being of infants who are born substance-affected. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 (CARA) amended certain provisions of CAPTA that relate to substance-affected infants (see table 1). In addition to provisions related to substance-affected infants, CAPTA also requires governors to provide an assurance to the Secretary of HHS that they have provisions or procedures for certain individuals to report known and suspected instances of child abuse and neglect, which are generally referred to as mandated reporter laws.",
      "In addition, in April 2017, ACF issued a program instruction on reporting requirements, including changes in those requirements brought about by the 2016 amendments to CAPTA. ACF conducted limited monitoring of states prior to the amendments passed in 2016. According to ACF officials, if presented with evidence of potential deficiencies, the agency would attempt to learn more about the state’s activities. In one instance, ACF reviewed South Carolina’s policies and found them to not be in compliance with the notification and safe care plan requirements of CAPTA. It directed the state to develop a program improvement plan to bring it into full compliance, which South Carolina submitted in April 2016. In a recent progress report (February–April 2017), South Carolina reported that it was focused on updating statutes, developing policies and procedures, training child protective service workers, and building relations with health care providers. In response to the 2016 amendments to CAPTA that added the requirement for HHS to monitor state policies and procedures to address the needs of substance-affected infants, ACF officials told us that staff in regional offices will review states’ annual reports, submitted in June 2017. In its program instruction describing the reporting requirements, ACF asked each state to submit a new Governor’s Assurance, as well as a narrative explaining what they have done in response to the amendments. Specifically, ACF asked states to provide information on any changes that were made in state laws, policies, or procedures related to identifying and referring infants affected by substance abuse to CPS as a result of prenatal drug exposure. It also requested updates on states’ policies and procedures regarding the development of plans of safe care; a description of how states have developed systems to monitor plans of safe care; and a description of any outreach or coordination efforts the states have taken to implement the amendments, among other things.",
      "However, states have experienced challenges implementing new CAPTA requirements. Many states reported in our survey that they are not completely adhering to the law. This is reflected in ACF’s review of state plans, some of which are resulting in program improvement plans. States cite challenges that stem, in part, from ACF’s lack of specificity in providing guidance on implementing CAPTA requirements. Specifically, states report that ACF has not provided clear guidance about which substance-affected infants health care providers are required to notify CPS about, as well what a plan of safe care is and for whom it should be developed. Given the challenges that states reported facing in implementing the provisions, a majority reported wanting more help from ACF, such as trainings and teleconferences with other states, to help overcome their challenges. Additional guidance and assistance from HHS would help states better understand what they need to do to develop policies and procedures that meet the needs of children and families affected by substance use. The Secretary of HHS should direct ACF to provide additional guidance and technical assistance to states to address known challenges and enhance their understanding of CAPTA requirements, including the requirements for health care providers to notify CPS of substance- affected infants and the development of a plan of safe care for these infants. We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment. HHS’s comments are reproduced in appendix I. HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated into our report where appropriate. HHS did not concur with our recommendation. HHS stated that: in January 2017, ACF clarified in guidance several of the issues raised in the report, including the population of infants and families covered by the provision and the state flexibility inherent in determining which infants are “affected by” substance abuse, and the terminology used in the federal law of what a “plan of safe care” is; ACF believes it is necessary to allow states the flexibility to meet the requirements in the context of their state CPS program; several of the challenges that the GAO notes are not specific to CAPTA compliance with the safe care plan and notification requirements; and it does see the value in continuing to provide technical assistance to states to address known challenges and to enhance their understanding of CAPTA requirements.",
      "During our discussions with states and in responses to our survey, state officials did not delineate which federal requirement impacted their approach to serving children and families. As stated in our conclusion, vulnerable infants may be at risk for child abuse and neglect if adequate supports and services are not available to ensure their safety. Lastly, HHS indicated that it will continue to provide technical assistance to states and fund demonstration sites to establish or enhance collaboration across community agencies and courts. Although continuing to provide technical assistance to states should be beneficial, our findings demonstrate that additional guidance is also needed. For example, 38 states reported that additional guidance on requirements for health care providers to notify CPS of substance-affected infants would be extremely or very helpful. Similarly, 37 states reported that additional guidance on developing, implementing, and monitoring plans to ensure the safety and well-being of substance-affected infants would be extremely or very helpful. Overall, given the results of our review, we continue to believe our recommendation is warranted. Effective implementation of our recommendation should help states better implement protections for children.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "Moreover, out-of-school suspensions are an exclusionary disciplinary action; that is, they remove or exclude students from the usual instructional or learning environment. Selecting districts with a range of out-of-school suspension rate was intended to generate a mix of districts that commonly use exclusionary discipline, as well as those that may employ alternatives. For site selection, we used out-of-school suspension data in two ways. First, we excluded districts that did not have a disparity in out-of-school suspension rates for Black students, boys, or students with disabilities. Prior GAO work and Education’s data showed that these groups were particularly vulnerable to discipline disparities, and the purpose of this research objective was to understand district efforts to identify and address such disparities. Second, we grouped school districts by whether their out-of-school suspension rate increased or decreased between 2011-12 and 2013-14. Exploring school districts that changed in different ways over time was intended to help us identify successful efforts to reduce suspensions as well as challenges districts face in addressing disparate discipline. Using the above criteria, we grouped school districts into the following categories: Category 1 and 2: Large school district and out-of-school suspension rate that increased (or decreased) from 2011-12 to 2013-14 Category 3 and 4: Medium school district and out-of-school suspension rate that increased (or decreased) from 2011-12 to 2013- 14 Category 5 and 6: Small school district and out-of-school suspension rate that increased (or decreased) from 2011-12 to 2013-14. After sorting school districts into the above categories, we randomized the list within each category to improve the methodological rigor of selecting school districts. In addition, we applied a series of post-checks to our list of districts in each grouping to ensure we had appropriate variety to consider other key factors in school discipline. Specifically, we checked for variety in: types of public schools in the district, geographic diversity both in terms of region of the country and use of corporal punishment in the district, and use of restraint or seclusion in the district.",
      "Though an interaction may be “negative,” it does not necessarily imply that the group presented in the interaction was significantly less likely to receive the given disciplinary action because interactions are interpreted relative to the main effect of each variable in the interaction. For example, as shown in table 10, the interaction for percentage of Black boys was negative for out-of-school suspensions; however, the estimated incidence of out-of-school suspensions for a school with a higher than average percentage of Black students and a higher than average percentage of boys was positive. Since the contribution for an interaction coefficient is relative, in this example the contribution of the main effects outweighed that of the interaction, resulting in a positive effect altogether, despite the negative interaction. To obtain information on how selected school districts are addressing discipline issues, including any challenges they face in doing so, we selected five school districts to serve as illustrative examples. To select school districts, we used CRDC data to sort school districts into categories based on district size; the presence of disparities in out-of- school suspension rates for boys, Black students, or students with disabilities; and whether the out-of-school suspension rate was increasing or decreasing between the two most recent CRDC collections. With regard to size, we collapsed several categories that Education has previously used into three groupings, each with roughly one-third of all students attending public schools in school year 2013-14: Large School District: 25,000 or more students (34.7% of all students in 2013-14) Medium School District: 5,000 to 24,999 students (33.2% of all students in 2013-14) Small School District: Less than 5,000 students (32.1% of all students in 2013-14) Further, we focused on out-of-school suspensions for selection purposes because this disciplinary action was one of the most frequently reported disciplinary actions employed by schools in Education’s two most recent data collection efforts on the issue (2011-12 and 2013-14 CRDC)."

Previously, OTs were only authorized for advanced research. Prototype Authorities Section 845 granted DARPA the authority to use OTs for prototype projects directly related to weapons or weapon systems proposed to be acquired by DOD. Section 845 required that \"to the maximum extent practicable,\" prototypes be competitively awarded. This authority was set to terminate after three years. Section 845 remained as a note to 10 U.S.C. 2371 until separately codified as 10 U.S.C. 2371b in the FY2016 NDAA ( P.L. 114-92 ). Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-355 ) Section 1301 redesignated the language in 10 U.S.C. 2358 (granting the authority to use OTs) to 10 U.S.C. 2371. Reporting Requirements Section 1301 also required DOD to submit an annual report to the armed services committees, to include a general description of the other transactions, including the technologies involved in the research, the potential military and, if any, commercial utility of such technologies, the reasons for not using a contract or grant to provide support for such research, and the amount of payments, if any, received during the fiscal year pursuant to a clause in the other transactions and to what accounts such payments were credited. National Defense Authorization Act for FY1997 ( P.L. 104-201 ) Section 203 required that a senior DOD official be designated in OSD, and that the officials' sole responsibility be developing policy related to, and ensuring implementation of, DOD's dual-use technology program. This section authorized DOD to use OTs (as well as contracts, cooperative agreements, and grants) for dual-use projects only if the project \"is entered into through the use of competitive procedures.\"",
      "Section 743 granted DOD the authority to use OTs to conduct research on Gulf War Syndrome, to determine its relationship to possible exposures of members of the Armed Forces to chemical warfare agents and hazardous materials, and the use of inoculations and new drugs. Expanded Prototype Authorities Section 804 amended Section 845 of the FY1994 NDAA by extending to the military departments and officials designated by the Secretary of Defense, the authority to use OTs for certain prototype projects. This authority, originally granted solely to DARPA and set to expire after three years, was given a new termination date of September 30, 1999. Reporting Requirements Section 267 modified elements of the annual report to the armed services committees. National Defense Authorization Act for FY1998 ( P.L. 105-85 ) Section 832 amended 10 U.S.C. 2371 by clarifying that certain information submitted to DOD (i.e. a proposal, business plan, technical information) be protected from disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 for a period of five years. Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for FY1999 ( P.L. 105-261 ) Section 241 extended the sunset day for the authority to use OTs for prototypes from September 30, 1999, to September 30, 2001.

    ],

    "documentation": [
      "According to Bureau documentation the estimate will be updated as the program meets milestones and to reflect changes in technical or program assumptions. Figure 2 details the Bureau’s cost estimation process. OAM was involved extensively in the development of the 2017 estimate, an increased involvement compared to 2015, according to Bureau officials. OAM participated in regular review meetings throughout the development of the estimate and also developed an independent cost estimate, as shown in the figure below. End-to-end system testing activities for the 2020 Census are currently underway in Providence, Rhode Island. According to the Bureau, information collected from the test, such as overall response rates and the use of administrative records to inform census records, will inform future versions of the life-cycle cost estimate. Some updates from the test will be incorporated into the next cost estimate, which will be available in the first quarter of the coming fiscal year. Since our June 2016 report, in which we reviewed the Bureau’s 2015 version of the cost estimate, the Bureau has made significant progress. For example, the Bureau has put into place a work breakdown structure (WBS) that defines the work, products, activities, and resources necessary to accomplish the 2020 Census and is standardized for use in budget planning, operational planning, and cost estimation. However, the Bureau’s October 2017 cost estimate for the 2020 Census does not fully reflect characteristics of a high-quality estimate as described in our Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide and cannot be considered reliable. Our Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide describes best practices for developing reliable cost estimates. For our reporting needs, we collapsed these best practices into four characteristics for sound cost estimating— comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible—and identified specific best practices for each characteristic. To be considered reliable, an organization must meet or substantially meet each characteristic.",
      "An independent cost estimate, though important for the credibility of an estimate, does not fulfill the same function as a targeted cross-check of individual elements. Comprehensive estimates have enough detail to ensure that cost elements are neither omitted nor double-counted, all cost-influencing assumptions are detailed in the estimate’s documentation, and a work breakdown structure is defined. Our analysis of the 2017 cost estimate demonstrates improvement over the 2015 cost estimate when the Bureau’s cost estimate only partially met the criteria for comprehensive. We found the Bureau met or substantially met all four best practices for the comprehensive characteristic, as shown in figure 7. For example, all life-cycle costs are included in the estimate along with a complete description of the 2020 Census program and current schedule. We also found that the Bureau substantially met criteria for documenting cost influencing ground rules and assumptions. A standardized WBS (as detailed in table 1) with supporting dictionary outlines the major work of the program and describes the activities and deliverables at the project level where costs are tracked. In 2016, the Bureau’s WBS did not contain sufficient detail and we found significant differences in the presentation of the work between sources. In 2017, based on our review of Bureau documentation and interviews with Bureau officials, we found that the WBS is standardized and cost elements are presented in detail. The WBS is a necessary program management tool because it provides a basic framework for a variety of related tasks like estimating costs, developing schedules, identifying resources, determining where risks may occur, and providing the means for measuring program status. Although the Bureau’s updated life-cycle cost estimate reflects three of the four characteristics of a reliable cost estimate, we are not making any new recommendations to the Bureau in this report. We continue to believe the prior recommendation, made in 2016, remains relevant: that the Secretary of Commerce ensure that the Bureau finalizes the steps needed to fully meet the characteristics of a high-quality estimate, most notably in the well-documented area."

    "question": "According to the report, what are the specific challenges faced by states with decentralized 911 governance structures in implementing NG911 systems, and how do these challenges impact the transition to NG911, particularly in terms of governance models and agreements among state and local authorities?",

      "D) The need for NG911 systems to process all types of emergency calls, including multimedia messages, which may require additional training and policy development."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "As we have previously reported, 911 services have evolved from basic 911—which provided Americans with a universally recognized emergency number—to Enhanced 911 which also routes calls to the appropriate call center and provides information about the caller’s location and a call back number. NG911 represents the next evolution in 911 services by using IP-based technology to deliver and process 911 traffic. Under NG911, call centers will continue to receive voice calls and location information, but will also be able to accommodate emergency communications from the range of technologies in use today. In addition, NG911 systems provide call centers with enhanced capabilities to route and transfer calls and data, which could improve call centers’ abilities to handle overflow calls and increase information sharing with first responders. Generally speaking, 911 communications begin when a caller dials 911 using a landline, wireless, or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) system. Once a 911 caller places an emergency call, a communications provider receives and routes the call to the appropriate call center, along with the caller’s phone number and location (i.e., street address for a landline caller, approximate geographic location for a wireless caller, and the subscriber’s address for VoIP). Calls and data may be routed to 911 call centers using legacy methods (i.e., routing calls across traditional telephone networks) or NG911 methods (i.e., routing calls and other data through IP-networks). Once the call reaches a call center, trained call takers and dispatchers determine the nature of the emergency and dispatch first responders, typically using a variety of equipment and systems, including call handling systems, mapping programs, and computer aided dispatch. Figure 1 illustrates the 911 communications and dispatch process. As illustrated in figure 1, NG911 systems use IP-networks capable of carrying voice plus large amounts of data. These emergency-services networks are typically deployed at the state or regional level with multiple call centers connecting to the network.",
      "In addition, another official raised privacy and liability concerns. Call routing: One of the core services of an NG911 system is the ability to have calls routed to the appropriate call center based on a wireless caller’s physical location, instead of the location of the cellular tower that receives and transmits the call. An FCC-sponsored working group reported that there are several options for achieving this and each option has unique positive and negative aspects. One challenge officials in two states noted was that rather than a single, nationwide approach to routing these calls, state and local 911 authorities would need to work individually with the wireless carriers to determine how to best implement location-based call routing. Governance: FCC has noted that transitioning to NG911 will likely result in new roles and levels of coordination between state 911 authorities, local 911 authorities, 911 call centers, and 911 service providers. Further, relationships among authorities at the state and local level may change as states work to interconnect NG911 systems. State and local officials noted that these types of governance challenges can apply in a variety of situations, including within or between states. Evolving roles: As previously mentioned, 911 governance structures vary among states. These varying governance structures may pose different challenges. For example, some states have a centralized structure in which a single government agency is responsible for statewide 911 system’s administration and policy. Officials in two states told us that although they faced challenges transitioning to NG911, their states’ centralized 911 structure eased the transition in their states because there was uniformity in policy and technology, among other things, coming from a single statewide authority. In other states, 911 systems are primarily a local responsibility and organized with decentralized authorities and resources. In these instances, there may be specific challenges related to transitioning to an interconnected NG911 system.",
      "However, the existence of an IP- network alone does not constitute an NG911 system. As defined by standards developed by the emergency communications community, an NG911 system should have the capability to, among other things: provide a secure environment for emergency communications; acquire and integrate additional data for routing and answering calls; process all types of emergency calls, including multimedia messages; transfer calls with added data to other call centers or first responders. While NG911 systems must possess certain capabilities, it is important to note that states and localities may make decisions about which capabilities they intend to use to best meet their needs. In addition, states and localities have the authority to make decisions about what NG911 equipment, systems, and vendors to use; thus, the configurations of these systems vary. According to a panel of experts convened by the National 911 Program, the transition to NG911 may require a variety of technical and operational changes to current 911 systems and processes. For example, technical changes can include upgrades to networks or installing new hardware or software in 911 call centers. Operational changes can include the need for additional training or the development of new policies and procedures (e.g., new procedures for processing or storing multimedia). These technical and operational changes may also have effects on 911 funding and state and local governance structures, which we will discuss in more detail later in this report. According to an FCC advisory body that examined NG911 systems architecture in 2016, while NG911 systems are implemented in a variety of ways at the state or local level, NG911 implementation can occur gradually and in phases. According to this model, NG911 implementation occurs on a continuum that begins with legacy 911 systems and ends with a fully deployed NG911 national end-state where all individual 911 call centers nationwide would be connected. The NG911 implementation model identifies activities that take place as part of the NG911 transition, many of which occur concurrently, such as: planning (e.g., conducting feasibility studies, preparing databases, establishing governance models); acquiring, testing, and implementing NG911 system elements (e.g., establishing an emergency-services IP-network, location-based call routing, processing multimedia); connecting call centers within a jurisdiction (i.e., jurisdictional end- state in which all call centers are fully NG911 operational, supported by agreements, policies, and procedures); and connecting NG911 systems nationwide (i.e., national end-state in which all call centers in the nation are fully NG911 operational, supported by agreements, policies, and procedures)."

However, the PPA also includes a provision that allows the institution to provide incentive compensation to individuals for the recruitment of foreign students who are ineligible to receive Title IV funds. If the institution's main campus has a student enrollment of 500 students, and the institution's total revenue for the year is $1 million, and the institution has already spent $150,000 on marketing and recruitment efforts, how much of the institution's revenue must come from non-Title IV funds to meet the 10% requirement, considering the impact of the incentive compensation provision on the institution's revenue allocation?",
    "choices": [
      "A) 7.5%",
      "B) 10%",
      "C) 12.5%",
      "D) 15%"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "This is known as the 90/10 rule. Examples of non-Title IV funds include private education loans and some military and veterans' benefits, such as benefits provided under the Post-9/11 GI Bill program. If an IHE violates the 90/10 rule in one year, it does not immediately lose its Title IV eligibility. Rather, it is placed on a provisional eligibility status for two years. If the IHE violates the 90/10 rule for two consecutive years, it loses its eligibility for at least two years. In a PPA, an IHE must agree it will not provide any commission or incentive compensation to individuals based directly or indirectly on their success in enrolling students or the enrolled students' obtaining financial aid; however, some exceptions apply to this general rule. For instance, IHEs can provide incentive compensation to individuals for the recruitment of foreign students who are ineligible to receive Title IV funds or they can provide incentive compensation through a profit-sharing plan. The ban on incentive compensation only applies to the activities of securing enrollment (recruitment) and securing financial aid. Other activities are not banned, and ED draws a distinction between activities that involve directly working with individual students and policy-level determinations that affect recruitment and financial aid awards. For instance, an individual who is responsible for contacting potential student applicants or assisting students in filling out an enrollment application cannot receive incentive compensation, but an individual who conducts marketing activities, such as the broad dissemination of informational brochures or the collection of contact information, can receive incentive compensation. HEA Section 485(f), referred to as the Clery Act, requires domestic Title IV participating IHEs (1) to report to ED campus crime statistics and (2) establish and disseminate campus safety and security policies. Both the campus crime statistics and campus safety and security policies must be compiled and disseminated to current and prospective students and employees in an IHE's annual security report (ASR).",
      "Finally, additional criteria may apply to an institution depending on its control or the type of educational programs it offers. For instance, proprietary institutions must derive at least 10% of their revenues from non-Title IV funds (also known as the 90/10 rule). Failure to fulfill some of these requirements does not necessarily end an IHE's participation in the Title IV programs, but may lead to additional oversight from ED and/or restrictions placed an IHE's Title IV participation. This report provides a general overview of HEA provisions that affect a postsecondary institution's eligibility for participation in Title IV student aid programs. It first describes general eligibility criteria at both the institutional and programmatic level and then, in more detail, the program integrity triad. Next, it discusses several issues that are closely related to institutional eligibility: Program Participation Agreements, campus safety policies and crime reporting required under the Clery Act, the return of Title IV funds, and distance education. To be eligible to participate in HEA Title IV student aid programs, institutions must meet several criteria. These criteria include requirements related to programs offered by the institutions, student enrollment, institutional operations, and the length of academic programs. This section discusses the definition of an eligible IHE for the purposes of Title IV participation and program eligibility requirements. The HEA contains two definitions of institutions of higher education. Section 101 provides a general definition of IHE that applies to institutional eligibility for participation in HEA programs other than Title IV programs. The Section 102 definition of IHE is used only to determine institutional eligibility to participate in HEA Title IV programs. Section 101 of the HEA provides a general definition of IHE. This definition applies to institutional participation in non-Title IV HEA programs. Section 101 IHEs can be public or private nonprofit educational institutions. Section 101 specifies criteria both public and private nonprofit educational institutions must meet to be considered IHEs.",
      "ED may then approve, approve subject to limitations, or deny the institution's request. Several other requirements affect institutional eligibility for Title IV programs. Some of these requirements include institution Program Participation Agreements, which include provisions related to incentive compensation and campus crime reporting requirements; return of Title IV funds; and distance education. The failure to meet the requirements for any of these may result in the loss of Title IV eligibility or other sanctions. HEA Section 487 specifies that each institution wanting to participate in Title IV student aid programs is required to have a current Program Participation Agreement (PPA). A PPA is a document in which the institution agrees to comply with the laws, regulations, and policies applicable to the Title IV programs; it applies to an IHE's branch campuses and locations that meet Title IV requirements, as well as its main campus. It also lists all of the Title IV programs in which the IHE is eligible to participate, the date on which the PPA expires, and the date on which the IHE must reapply for participation. By signing a PPA, an institution agrees that it will act as a fiduciary responsible for properly administering Title IV funds, will not charge students a processing fee to determine a student's eligibility for such funds, and will establish and maintain administrative and fiscal procedures to ensure the proper administration of Title IV programs. The PPA reiterates many provisions required for institutional eligibility and ED certification discussed earlier in this report and contains several additional notable requirements that may affect an IHE's Title IV eligibility, which are described below. Along with the general participation requirements with which an institution must comply, a PPA may also contain institution-specific requirements. As part of their PPAs, domestic and foreign proprietary IHEs must agree to derive at least 10% of their revenue from non-Title IV funds (i.e., no more than 90% of their revenue can come from Title IV funds)."

      "As previously mentioned, agencies are required to set annual square foot reduction targets for domestic office and warehouse space in their annual Plans. According to an OMB official, to help ensure the targets are realistic, agencies are also required to identify the specific projects that will help them to achieve their space reduction targets. According to GSA and OMB officials, agencies submit their Plans, including their reduction targets, and their Plans are reviewed by both GSA and OMB. But each individual agency ultimately establishes its targets based on what it determines to be cost-effective and feasible. Through its Real Property Efficiency Plan template, GSA provides guidance to agencies on what is expected in their annual submissions. Each agency is required to document its internal controls, such as the process for identifying and prioritizing reductions to office and warehouse space and disposal of properties based on return on investment and mission requirements. The identified internal controls should help ensure that an agency’s proposed space reduction projects reflect an efficient use of space and are cost effective. A review of our five case study agencies illustrated some of the different approaches agencies used to determine their reduction targets. For example, several agencies’ targets were based on the total estimated feasible reductions identified by each agency component. In contrast, one agency centrally established a reduction target percentage and then asked its components to develop projects to meet that target. According to case-study agency officials, the agencies considered many factors, including their missions, priorities, component needs, and available budgets, when determining their targets. We found that the number and magnitude of the space reduction projects agencies identified in their fiscal year 2017 Plans varied greatly and were generally proportional to the size of the agency’s real property portfolio. The number of projects identified in agency Plans ranged from as few as 3 projects (the minimum required in the Plans) to nearly 400 projects.",
      "OMB also issued the RTF policy which clarified existing policy to dispose of excess properties and promote more efficient use of real property assets. The RTF policy requires agencies to: (1) submit annual Real Property Efficiency Plans (Plan) to GSA and OMB; (2) issue a policy that specifies a design standard for maximum useable square feet by workstation for use in domestic office space; (3) set and specify in their Plans annual reduction targets for their domestic office and warehouse space for a 5-year period; (4) set and specify in their Plans annual reduction targets for domestic owned building properties reported in the Federal Real Property Profile; and (5) continue to not increase the square footage of their domestic inventory of office and warehouse space. Additionally, agencies must identify in their Plans potential projects related to office and warehouse consolidation, co-location, disposal, as well as construction and acquisition efforts. OMB is responsible for reporting the progress of agencies’ efforts in reducing the amount of federal real property space under the RTF policy. GSA has two key leadership responsibilities related to real property management. First, GSA’s Public Buildings Service functions as the federal government’s principal landlord. In this role, GSA acquires, manages, and disposes of federally owned real property for which it has custody and control on behalf of federal agencies that occupy the space. Additionally, GSA leases commercial buildings on behalf of agencies and manages the lease agreements. In these situations, GSA executes an occupancy agreement with a customer agency for each space assignment that is similar to a sublease between GSA and the agency. The occupancy agreement outlines both the financial specifics of the agreement and the responsibilities of GSA and the customer agency. There are certain unique advantages for customer agencies when GSA leases on their behalf. For example, GSA is able to enter into longer-term leases, and agencies can release space back to GSA with 4 months’ written notice if certain conditions are met, relieving the agencies of the cost for the returned space.",
      "To obtain background information for all three objectives, we reviewed relevant literature, including laws governing federal real-property management and agencies’ efforts to reduce their real property portfolios and Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) and GSA’s memorandums and guidance governing the RTF policy. We also reviewed prior GAO and GSA inspector general reports describing agencies’ real-property management and efforts to more efficiently manage their real property portfolios. To determine the approaches used and any challenges faced by the CFO Act agencies in achieving their RTF reduction targets for all their domestic office and warehouse space, we conducted a content analysis of the agencies’ 5-year Real Property Efficiency Plans (Plans) for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. These Plans were obtained directly from each of the agencies. Each Plan describes an agency’s overall strategic and tactical approach in managing its real property, provides a rationale for and justifies its optimum portfolio, and directs the identification and execution of real property disposals, efficiency improvements, general usage, and cost-savings measures. The content analysis of the Plans helped us to understand the approaches agencies used to reduce space, how space- reduction targets were set, and any challenges they experienced in reducing their space. To identify agencies’ approaches to achieving their RTF targets, we reviewed all agencies’ Plans to determine the most frequently mentioned approaches agencies reported using or planned to use to reduce their real-property footprints. As part of their plans, each agency is required to include a section detailing approaches it plans to use to reduce space. While these sections were the primary focus of the analysis, we analyzed the Plans as a whole for any additional mention of agencies’ approaches to reduce space. Based on the frequently identified approaches, codes were developed. An analyst reviewed all the agencies’ Plans and coded the approaches and another analyst reviewed the coding.",
      "The office and warehouse square footage reductions are calculated annually using GSA occupancy agreement data and agencies’ self-reported data in GSA’s Federal Real Property Profile. For example, for fiscal year 2016, the space reduction calculations based on these data sources at the end of the fiscal year was compared to the square footage reported in fiscal year 2015. At the time of our review, this was the first and only year of RTF data available as the policy was implemented in March 2015. We conducted a data reliability assessment of the RTF data GSA provided by interviewing GSA officials and reviewing documentation, and concluded the data were reliable for our purposes. We also interviewed officials at GSA and OMB and reviewed relevant documentation to learn more about each agency’s role and the requirements of the RTF policy. We interviewed officials from our selected case-study agencies to obtain supporting documentation and to improve our understanding of how agencies set their RTF targets, agencies’ progress toward those targets, and the approaches used and challenges faced in meeting those targets. We also asked the agency officials for examples of successful practices used to reduce their office and warehouse space. To determine how GSA manages vacated federally owned and commercially leased space that it leases to agencies, we reviewed federal requirements and GSA policies and vacancy data. We conducted a data reliability assessment of GSA’s vacancy and cost avoidance data by interviewing GSA officials and reviewing documentation, and concluded the data were reliable for our purposes. We also interviewed GSA headquarters and regional officials and obtained documentation on how GSA manages space returned by agencies. We conducted this performance audit from April 2017 to March 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.",
      "OMB reported that under Freeze the Footprint, agencies achieved a 24.7-million square foot reduction between fiscal years 2012 and 2015. Officials from the IRS, which accounts for 70 percent of Treasury’s real property inventory, noted it has released 2.7-million square feet (approximately 10 percent) in the past 5 years, bringing its total square footage down to 25.3 million. According to officials from three of our case study agencies, a certain amount of space is required to effectively fulfill their missions. As such, the closer agencies get to attaining their optimum footprint, their ability to achieve further space reductions may be limited. In November 2016, GSA put into effect a new standard operating procedure to, among other things, standardize and streamline the process of receiving, reviewing, and documenting agencies’ space release actions. As previously mentioned, GSA’s occupancy agreements for space it leases on behalf of its customer agencies generally allow the agencies to release space back to GSA with as little as 4 months’ notice, if certain conditions are met. This can enable agencies to reduce their space and related rent costs relatively quickly without penalty. As a result of this new process, GSA established a centralized e-mail for agencies to submit their space release requests. The e-mail is maintained at GSA headquarters before it is forwarded to the respective GSA region. GSA also developed a centralized space release tracking spreadsheet to help ensure that all GSA regions were (1) notifying the customer agency of GSA’s determination on whether the space release request was within GSA’s policy, and (2) processing the space release and ceasing rent billings in a timely manner. According to GSA headquarters officials, this new process was implemented to rectify past concerns that space release requests were not centrally tracked, GSA regions may not have been making consistent determinations, and some requests either were missed or were not processed within the appropriate time frames."

    "question": "The National Defense Authorization Act for 2018 (NDAA) included a provision that would allow employers to purchase workers' compensation for workers on recreational vessels under state laws, rather than the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA). However, this provision was not included in the Senate version of the bill.

      "D) The LHWCA's zone of coverage was extended to include workers on recreational vessels, but the provision would have limited the scope of the LHWCA by excluding workers engaged in certain activities on these vessels."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A)",
    "documentation": [
      "This legislation would expand the types of recreational vessels. Because persons who work on recreational vessels are not covered by the LHWCA, the legislation would allow employers to purchase workers' compensation for these workers under state laws rather than the LHWCA, which, due to the more generous benefits frequently offered by the LHWCA and the limited number of providers, may be more expensive. In the 115 th Congress, Section 3509 of H.R. 2810 , the National Defense Authorization Act for 2018 (NDAA), as initially passed by the House of Representatives on July 14, 2017, contained this legislative provision. This provision was not included in the Senate version of the bill nor in the final NDAA enacted into law. The LHWCA has been amended four times to extend coverage to occupations outside the original scope of the law. In 1928, coverage was extended to employees of the District of Columbia . The provision was repealed, effective for all injuries occurring on or after July 26, 1982, with the enactment by the District of Columbia government of the District of Columbia Workers' Compensation Act of 1982. Benefits for injuries that occurred prior to July 26, 1982, continue to be paid under the LHWCA. Coverage was extended to overse a s military and public works contractors in 1941 with the enactment of the Defense Base Act. In 1952, coverage was extended to civilian employees of nonappropriated fund instrumentalities of the armed forces , such as service clubs and post exchanges. Coverage was extended in 1953 to employees working on the Outer Continental Shelf in the exploration and the development of natural resources , such as workers on offshore oil platforms. Employers required by the LHWCA to provide workers' compensation coverage to their employees may either purchase private insurance or self-insure. The DOL is responsible for authorizing insurance carriers to provide coverage under the LHWCA program and for authorizing companies to self-insure. However, the DOL does not set or regulate insurance premiums.",
      "In exchange for this no-fault protection and the guarantee of benefits in the event of an employment-related injury, illness, or death, workers give up their rights to bring actions against employers in the civil court system and give up their rights to seek damages for injuries and illnesses, including pain and suffering, outside of those provided by the workers' compensation laws. Workers' compensation is mandatory in all states and the District of Columbia, with the exception of Texas. In Texas, employers may, under certain conditions, opt out of the workers' compensation system, but in doing so subject themselves to civil actions brought by injured employees. Prior to the enactment of the LHWCA in 1927, longshore and harbor workers were not covered by any workers' compensation system. Although persons who worked entirely on land were covered by workers' compensation laws in those states that enacted such laws, pursuant to the Supreme Court's 1917 decision in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen , state workers' compensation systems did not have jurisdiction over persons working on the \"navigable waters\" of the United States because the Constitution granted the authority over \"matters of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction\" to the federal government. The LHWCA created a federal workers' compensation program to cover these workers. In 1972, the LHWCA zone of coverage was extended to include areas adjacent to navigable waters that are used for loading, unloading, repairing, or building vessels. The LHWCA provisions apply to any private firm with any covered employees who work, full- or part-time, on the navigable waters of the United States, including in any of the following adjoining areas: piers; wharves; dry docks; terminals; building ways; marine railways; or other areas customarily used in the loading, unloading, repairing, or building of vessels. With the exception of workers excluded by statute (listed below), the LHWCA covers any maritime employee of a covered firm, including longshore workers (those who load and unload ships) and harbor workers (i.e., ship repairmen, ship builders, and ship breakers).",
      "Sections 2(3) and 3(b) of the LHWCA exclude the following workers from coverage: Workers covered by a state workers' compensation law, including employees exclusively engaged in clerical, secretarial, security, or data processing work; persons employed by a club, camp, recreational operation, museum, or retail outlet; marina employees not engaged in the construction, replacement, or expansion of the marina; suppliers, transporters, and vendors doing business temporarily at the site of a covered employer; aquaculture workers; and employees who build any recreational vessel under 65 feet in length, or repair any recreational vessel, or dismantle any part of a recreational vessel in connection with the repair of the vessel. Workers, whether covered or not covered by a state workers' compensation law, including masters and crew members of vessels; persons engaged by the master of a vessel to unload any vessel under 18 tons net; and employees of the federal government, or any state, local, or foreign government or any subdivision of such a government. Section 803 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) modified one of the excluded classes of workers under the LHWCA by adding additional exclusions for persons who work on recreational vessels over 65 feet in length. Prior to the amendment, Section 2(3)(F) of the LHWCA read as follows: (3) The term \"employee\" means…but such term does not include… (F) individuals employed to build, repair, or dismantle any recreational vessel under sixty-five feet in length. This section, as amended, reads as follows (with additions in italics): (3) The term \"employee\" means…but such term does not include… (F) individuals employed to build any recreational vessel under sixty-five feet in length, or individuals employed to repair any recreational vessel, or to dismantle any part of a recreational vessel in connection with the repair of such vessel. By granting an exemption from the LHWCA to persons engaged in the repair of any recreation vessel, regardless of its size, this amendment limits the scope of the LHWCA and increases the types of workers excluded from coverage.",
      "H.R. 6234 would have placed the Purple Heart into a new protected category, keeping it away from not just con artists but also memorabilia collectors.

    "question": "Given the recent bankruptcies of three of the largest coal companies in the United States, which of the following statements best reflects the current risk landscape for self-bonding in coal mine reclamation under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA)?",
    "choices": [
      "A) The OSMRE's decision to reexamine its self-bonding regulations in 2016 was a prudent response to the financial risks posed by coal mine operators.",
      "B) The government's potential financial risk for future reclamation costs resulting from coal mines with unsecured financial assurances is a direct result of the lack of regulation, not a consequence of recent bankruptcies.",
      "C) The OSMRE's policy advisory in August 2016, which advised states not to accept new or additional self-bonds, was a necessary step to mitigate the risks associated with self-bonding.",
      "D) The Interior Department's reconsideration of the need for changes to its bonding regulations in 2017 was a wise decision, as it would help ensure that reclamation is completed if a self-bonded operator does not do so."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "While SMCRA allows self-bonding in certain circumstances, when OSMRE first approved its self-bonding regulations, the agency did so noting that at the time there were companies financially sound enough that the probability of bankruptcy was small. Furthermore, the regulations stated that the intent was to avoid, to the extent reasonably possible, the acceptance of a self-bond from a company that would enter bankruptcy. However, as previously mentioned, three of the largest coal companies in the United States declared bankruptcy in 2015 and 2016, and these companies held approximately $2 billion in self-bonds at the time, according to an OSMRE August 2016 policy advisory, making it a very different risk landscape than originally envisioned. Following these bankruptcies—and recognizing that the coal industry was likely to continue to face economic challenges for several more years— OSMRE initiated steps in 2016 to reexamine the role of self-bonding for coal mine reclamation. Specifically, as previously mentioned, OSMRE issued a policy advisory in August 2016 noting that given these circumstances, state regulatory authorities should exercise their discretion under SMCRA and not accept new or additional self-bonds for any permit until coal production and consumption market conditions reach equilibrium. OSMRE has reported that it is not likely for that to occur until at least 2021. OSMRE also announced in September 2016 that the agency planned to examine changes to its bonding regulations that would, among other things, help ensure that reclamation is completed if a self-bonded operator does not do so. However, following a review of department actions that could affect domestic energy production, Interior announced in October 2017 that it was reconsidering the need for and scope of potential changes to its bonding regulations. OSMRE officials said that they did not have a timeline for finalizing a decision on potential changes in its bonding regulations. In addition, OSMRE rescinded its August 2016 policy advisory that states take steps to assess whether operators currently using self-bonds can still quality to do so and that states not accept any new self-bonds.",
      "In addition, two states reported recent issues related to surety companies. For example, state regulatory authority officials in Alabama said that a surety company that had provided surety bonds totaling $760,000 for four mines in that state had gone bankrupt or was insolvent. As of May 2017, the state had collected only $127,000. Similarly, state regulatory authority officials in Alaska said that as of August 2017, the state had not collected any part of a forfeited $150,000 surety bond because the surety company had gone bankrupt. In our previous work examining other types of environmental cleanup, we have found that the financial risk to the government and the amount of oversight needed for surety bonds are relatively low to moderate compared to other forms of financial assurances. Billions have been spent to reclaim mines abandoned prior to the financial assurance requirements SMCRA put in place, and billions more remain. Under SMCRA, self-bonding is allowed for coal mine operators with a history of financial solvency and continuous operation—the only type of energy production or mineral extraction activity we have reviewed for which this is allowed. Bankruptcies of coal mine operators in 2015 and 2016 have highlighted risks that OSMRE and state regulatory authorities face in managing self-bonding—a risk that may be greater today than when self-bonding was first authorized under SMCRA. If a self-bonded operator were to enter bankruptcy and does not provide a different type of financial assurance or complete the required reclamation, the regulatory authority and the taxpayer potentially assume the risk of paying for the reclamation. Although OSMRE said it would examine changes to its self- bonding regulations following recent bankruptcies, Interior recently said that it is reconsidering the need to do so. Because SMCRA explicitly allows states to decide whether to accept self-bonds, eliminating the risk that self-bonding poses would require amending SMCRA. Until such a change is made, the government will remain potentially at financial risk for future reclamation costs resulting from coal mines with unsecured financial assurances."

Given the size of the Medicaid program, its vulnerability to improper payments, and the growth in managed care, it is critical to have a full accounting of program integrity risks in managed care in order to best ensure the integrity of the whole Medicaid program. In its written comments, HHS also summarized several activities it uses to oversee and support states’ Medicaid program integrity efforts, including state program integrity reviews; collaborative audits conducted by federal contractors; Medicaid Integrity Institute training for state employees; and the Medicaid Provider Enrollment Compendium.

Our survey of state Medicaid agencies regarding coverage, spending, enrollment, and oversight of assisted living services in 2014, obtained information on challenges for Medicaid beneficiaries to access assisted living services in their states. States provided information related to factors that create challenges for Medicaid beneficiaries’ ability to access and receive assisted living services and the extent states had policies to help beneficiaries with the cost of room and board. A number of states in our survey cited common factors as creating the greatest challenges to a beneficiary’s ability to access assisted living services, including the number of assisted living facilities willing to accept Medicaid beneficiaries (13 states or 27 percent of the 48 states) program enrollment caps (9 states or 19 percent of the 48 states) beneficiaries’ inability to pay for assisted living facility room and board (9 states or 19 percent of the 48 states), which Medicaid typically does not cover low rates the state Medicaid program paid assisted living facilities (8 states or 17 percent of the 48 states). A number of states reported that they had policies to assist Medicaid beneficiaries with the costs of room and board charged by assisted living facilities, which Medicaid does not typically cover.",

To address our first three audit objectives to describe care settings for treating infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), Medicaid payment for NAS treatment, and the recommended practices and challenges for addressing NAS, we selected 32 stakeholders based on their relevant experience to cover a range of perspectives on NAS. Specifically, these stakeholders included those from site visits we conducted to four states—Kentucky, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. We selected these states because they met the following criteria: 1. the state had one of the top 10 highest incidence rates of NAS, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for 2013, the most recent year of publicly available data; 2. the state provided variation in United States geographic regions with high rates of NAS, as of 2012; 3. more than 40 percent of births in the state were financed by Medicaid, according to a 2016 Kaiser Family Foundation Medicaid Budget Survey; and 4. the state has a perinatal quality collaborative—a state or multi-state network of teams working to improve health outcomes for mothers and infants—with work related to NAS, which we identified through the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. As part of these site visits, we interviewed (1) officials from each of the four states, including Medicaid officials, Maternal and Child Health Directors, and Women’s Services Coordinators; (2) representatives from the four state perinatal collaboratives; (3) health care providers (including physicians or nurses) from eight hospitals of varying levels of care (two hospitals in each state), which were selected based on recommendations from the state perinatal collaboratives because of the hospitals’ experience treating NAS; and (4) officials from a residential treatment facility in each of the four states that provide prenatal and postpartum care to mothers, which were also selected based on recommendations from the state perinatal collaboratives regarding the facilities’ experience with pregnant women with opioid use disorders and their infants with NAS."

However, the lobbyist may have disclosed the position on an LD-1 report filed prior to 2008. According to the documentation, what is the minimum percentage of lobbyists who may not have properly disclosed previously held covered positions as required, and what is the estimated percentage of lobbyists who provided documentation for the income and expenses on their LD-2 reports for the year 2017?",

      "Our sample is based on a stratified random selection and is only one of a large number of samples that we may have drawn. Because each sample could have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample’s results as a 95 percent confidence interval. This interval would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples that we could have drawn. The percentage estimates for LD-2 reports have 95 percent confidence intervals of within plus or minus 12 percentage points or fewer of the estimate itself. We contacted all the lobbyists and lobbying firms in our sample and, using a structured web-based survey, asked them to confirm key elements of the LD-2 and whether they could provide written documentation for key elements in their reports, including the amount of income reported for lobbying activities; the amount of expenses reported on lobbying activities; the names of those lobbyists listed in the report; the houses of Congress and federal agencies that they lobbied, and the issue codes listed to describe their lobbying activity. After reviewing the survey results for completeness, we interviewed lobbyists and lobbying firms to review the documentation they reported as having on their online survey for selected elements of their respective LD- 2 report. Prior to each interview, we conducted a search to determine whether lobbyists properly disclosed their covered position as required by the LDA. We reviewed the lobbyists’ previous work histories by searching lobbying firms’ websites, LinkedIn, Leadership Directories, Legistorm, and Google. Prior to 2008, lobbyists were only required to disclose covered official positions held within 2 years of registering as a lobbyist for the client. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 amended that time frame to require disclosure of positions held 20 years before the date the lobbyists first lobbied on behalf of the client. Lobbyists are required to disclose previously held covered official positions either on the client registration (LD-1) or on an LD-2 report.",
      "In other instances, depending on the nature of the comparison being made, a difference of equal or even greater magnitude may not achieve statistical significance. Because each sample could have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample’s results as a 95 percent confidence interval. This is the interval that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. The percentage estimates presented in this report based on our sample for the 2017 survey have 95 percent confidence intervals within plus or minus 5.5 percentage points of the estimate itself, unless otherwise noted. We also note in this report when we are 95 percent confident that changes from 1997 or 2013 relative to 2017 are statistically significant. Online supplemental material shows the questions asked on the survey along with the percentage estimates and associated 95 percent confidence intervals for each item for each agency and government-wide. In a few instances, we report estimates with larger margins of error because we deemed them reliable representations of given findings due to the statistical significance of larger differences between comparison groups. In all cases, we report the applicable margins of error. In addition to sampling errors, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may also introduce other types of errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in how a particular question is interpreted, in the sources of information available to respondents, or in how the data were entered into a database or analyzed can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. With this survey, we took a number of steps to minimize these nonsampling errors. For example, our staff with subject matter expertise designed the questionnaire in collaboration with our survey specialists. As noted earlier, the new questions added to the survey were pretested to ensure they were relevant and clearly stated.",
      "Consequently, those who held covered official positions may have disclosed the information on the LD-1 or a LD-2 report filed prior to the report we examined as part of our random sample. Therefore, where we found evidence that a lobbyist previously held a covered official position, and that information was not disclosed on the LD-2 report under review, we conducted an additional review of the publicly available Secretary of the Senate or Clerk of the House database to determine whether the lobbyist properly disclosed the covered official position on a prior report or LD-1. Finally, if a lobbyist appeared to hold a covered position that was not disclosed, we asked for an explanation at the interview with the lobbying firm to ensure that our research was accurate. In previous reports, we reported the lower bound of a 90 percent confidence interval to provide a minimum estimate of omitted covered positions and omitted contributions with a 95 percent confidence level. We did so to account for the possibility that our searches may have failed to identify all possible omitted covered positions and contributions. As we have developed our methodology over time, we are more confident in the comprehensiveness of our searches for these items. Accordingly, this report presents the estimated percentages for omitted contributions and omitted covered positions, rather than the minimum estimates. As a result, percentage estimates for these items will differ slightly from the minimum percentage estimates presented in prior reports. In addition to examining the content of the LD-2 reports, we confirmed whether the most recent LD-203 reports had been filed for each firm and lobbyist listed on the LD-2 reports in our random sample. Although this review represents a random selection of lobbyists and firms, it is not a direct probability sample of firms filing LD-2 reports or lobbyists listed on LD-2 reports. As such, we did not estimate the likelihood that LD-203 reports were appropriately filed for the population of firms or lobbyists listed on LD-2 reports.",
      "While this is not consistent with the LDA and the guidance, this may be a source of some of the confusion regarding rounding errors. In 2016, the guidance was updated to include an additional example about rounding expenses to the nearest $10,000. In 2017, 11 percent of lobbyists reported $10,000 or more in income or expenses. The LDA requires lobbyists to disclose lobbying contacts made with federal agencies on behalf of the client for the reporting period. This year, of the 98 LD-2 reports in our sample, 51 reports disclosed lobbying activities at federal agencies. Of those, lobbyists provided documentation for all lobbying activities at executive branch agencies for 34 LD-2 reports. Figures 5 through 8 show that lobbyists for most LD-2 reports provided documentation for selected elements of their LD-2 reports from 2010 through 2017. Lobbyists for an estimated 93 percent of LD-2 reports filed year-end 2016 for all lobbyists listed political contributions on the report as required. Figure 9 shows that lobbyists for most lobbying firms filed contribution reports as required in our sample from 2010 through 2017. All individual lobbyists and lobbying firms reporting lobbying activity are required to file LD-203 reports semiannually, even if they have no contributions to report, because they must certify compliance with the gift and travel rules. The LDA requires a lobbyist to disclose previously held covered positions in the executive or legislative branch, such as high ranking agency officials and congressional staff, when first registering as a lobbyist for a new client. This can be done either on a new LD-1 or on the quarterly LD- 2 filing when added as a new lobbyist. This year, we estimate that 15 percent of all LD-2 reports may not have properly disclosed previously held covered positions as required. As in our other reports, some lobbyists were still unclear about the need to disclose certain covered positions, such as paid congressional internships or certain executive agency positions.",
      "The sample size of 98 LD-2 reports for this year’s review represents an increase from the sample size selected for the 2015 and 2016 reviews, and is a return to the sample size selected in reviews prior to 2015. We increased the sample size because, in 2016, we observed a change in the estimate of the percentage of reports that had documentation of income and expenses (83 percent down from 92 percent in 2015). At that time, we were unable to state that this was a statistically significant change because, in part, the reduced sample size of 80 did not give us enough power to detect and report on the change of that size. We excluded reports with no lobbying activity or with income or expenses of less than $5,000 from our sampling frame. We drew our sample from 45,818 activity reports filed for the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and the first and second quarters of 2017 available in the public House database, as of our final download date for each quarter. Our sample of LD-2 reports was not designed to detect differences over time. However, we conducted tests of significance for changes from 2010 to 2017 for the generalizable elements of our review. We found that results were generally consistent from year to year and there were few statistically significant changes after using a Bonferroni adjustment to account for multiple comparisons. For this year’s review, we identified that the estimated change in the percent of LD-2 reports that provided written documentation for the income and expenses from 2016 to 2017 is notable. In recent years, our findings show some variation in the estimate percentage of reports with documentation. Specifically, our estimate for 2017 (99 percent) represents a statistically significant increase from 2016. These changes are identified in the report. The inability to detect significant differences from year to year in our results may be related to sampling error alone or the nature of our sample, which was relatively small and was designed only for cross-sectional analysis."

      "These payments could take multiple forms. Economic analyses typically assume an equal payment to individuals or households regardless of their income or location or the effects of the carbon price on them individually. Alternatively, payments could be targeted or scaled to different segments of the population. Among the options mentioned above, economic studies indicate that using carbon tax revenues to offset reductions in existing, distortionary taxes would be the most economically efficient use of the revenues and yield the greatest benefit to the economy overall. This concept is sometimes referred to as a \"tax swap.\" Using carbon tax or fee revenues to offset other distortionary taxes (e.g., labor or capital) may yield a \"double-dividend,\" which includes: reduced GHG emissions; and reduced market distortions by reducing other distortionary taxes, such as investment or income. The economic models that examine the economic impacts of a carbon tax differ in their frameworks and underlying assumptions and often include multiple scenarios involving different uses of carbon tax revenue. In general, the economic models find that certain revenue recycling options may reduce the economy-wide carbon tax impacts but may not eliminate them entirely. Some studies cite particular economic modeling scenarios in which a carbon tax with certain revenue recycling applications would produce a net increase in GDP or economic welfare compared to a baseline scenario. These results indicate that, in certain modeling conditions, the economic improvements gained by reducing existing distortionary taxes would be greater than the costs imposed by the new carbon tax (without including the intended climate benefits of the policy). For example, results from a 2018 study demonstrated a net increase in GDP, compared to baseline conditions, when carbon tax revenues were used to finance proportionate reductions in labor tax rates (payroll tax). In general, the economic carbon tax studies usually agree on the relative ranking of revenue recycling options in terms of their ability to mitigate the economy-wide impacts of a carbon tax program.",
      "Some studies cite particular economic modeling scenarios in which a carbon tax and revenue recycling could produce a net increase in GDP or economic welfare, compared to a baseline scenario. These scenarios involve using carbon tax revenues to offset reductions in existing, distortionary taxes, such as corporate income or payroll taxes. Although the models indicate that these revenue applications would yield the greatest benefit to the economy overall, the models also find that lower-income households would likely face a disproportionate impact under such revenue applications. As lower-income households spend a greater proportion of their income on energy needs, these households are expected to experience disproportionate impacts from a carbon tax if revenues were not recycled back to them in some fashion, such as a lump-sum distribution. Carbon tax revenues that are used to offset the burden imposed on various sectors or specific population groups would not be available to support other objectives. An additional concern with a carbon tax involves potential disproportionate impacts to \"emission-intensive, trade-exposed industries.\" Policymakers could select among several options to address these concerns, either by establishing a border carbon adjustment program or allocating some of the carbon tax revenues to selected industry sectors based on an output-based metric. If other nations were to adopt comparable carbon price policies, this concern may be alleviated to some degree. Relatedly, a carbon tax is projected to disproportionately impact fossil fuel industries, particularly coal, and the communities that rely on their employment. To alleviate these impacts, policymakers could allocate some of the carbon tax revenue to provide transition assistance to employees or affected communities. Table A-1 identifies sources of GHG emissions that account for 0.5% or more of total U.S. GHG emissions. The sources are listed in descending order by their percentage contribution. CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, which accounts for almost 76% of total U.S. GHG emissions, are broken down by fossil fuel type: petroleum, coal, and natural gas."

    "question": "The Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) was established to provide capital to certain financial institutions, but its treatment as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital was a contentious issue. According to Treasury officials, the SBLF's financings were initially considered as Tier 2 capital because banks must maintain a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8% to be considered adequately capitalized by federal banking regulators. However, the Dodd-Frank Act mandated equalizing the consolidated capital requirements for Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies, which led to changes in dividend treatment. As a result, the SBLF's financings are now treated as Tier 1 capital, but with a non-cumulative dividend structure. This change in dividend treatment has significant implications for the SBLF's financings. Which of the following statements best describes the consequence of this change on the SBLF's financings, considering the implications of the Dodd-Frank Act and the characteristics of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital?",
    "choices": [
      "A) The SBLF's financings are now subject to a higher risk-weighted capital surcharge due to the increased Tier 1 capital requirement, which would disproportionately affect smaller banks.",
      "B) The SBLF's financings are now eligible for repurchase by the Treasury at a lower price due to the non-cumulative dividend structure, which would provide a more stable source of capital for banks.",
      "C) The SBLF's financings are now considered a more stable source of capital for banks due to the perpetual nature of Tier 1 capital, which would reduce the risk of capital shortfalls.",
      "D) The SBLF's financings are now subject to stricter regulatory oversight due to the increased Tier 1 capital requirement, which would lead to more frequent stress tests and capital assessments."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "The establishment of separate regulations for each of these different types of financial institutions was largely related to issues involving whether the SBLF's financings would be counted by banking regulatory agencies as Tier 1 capital (core capital that is relatively liquid, such as common shareholders' equity, disclosed reserves, most retained earnings, and perpetual noncumulative preferred stocks) or as Tier 2 capital (supplementary capital that consists mainly of undisclosed reserves, revaluation reserves, general provisions, hybrid instruments, and subordinated term debt). The treatment of the SBLF's financings was important given that banks must maintain a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (the ratio measures bank capital against assets, with asset values risk-weighted, or adjusted on a scale of riskiness) to be considered adequately capitalized by federal banking regulators. In addition, banks must maintain a minimum Tier 1 risk-based ratio to assets, typically 3% for banking institutions with the highest financial ratings and 4% for others. According to Treasury officials, under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules, S corporations can have only a single class of stock (common shares). Consequently, these institutions cannot issue preferred stock to Treasury. As a result, Treasury had to consider purchasing subordinated debt from these institutions, which the banking regulatory agencies would likely designate as Tier 2 capital. Treasury officials believed that providing Tier 2 capital would probably result in fewer S corporation participants. Additionally, because mutual lending institutions do not issue stock, Treasury officials were unable to receive preferred stock as consideration for an investment in this type of institution. Therefore, Treasury had to consider purchasing subordinated debt from these institutions as well. Treasury completed its regulations for C corporation banks first. For C corporations, SBLF funds are treated as Tier I capital and the Treasury purchases senior perpetual noncumulative preferred stock (or an equivalent).",
      "The stock pays a quarterly dividend on the first day of each quarter after closing of the SBLF capital program funding. Tier 1 capital is the core measure of a bank's financial strength from a regulator's point of view. It is composed of core capital, which consists primarily of common stock and disclosed reserves (or retained earnings) but may also include nonredeemable, noncumulative preferred stock. In contrast, S corporations and mutual lending institutions receive unsecured subordinated debentures from the Treasury, which are considered Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital requirements. The application deadline for C corporation banks was May 16, 2011. The application deadline for Subchapter S corporations and mutual lending institutions was June 6, 2011, and the application deadline for CDFIs was June 22, 2011. A total of 926 institutions applied for $11.8 billion in SBLF funding. Treasury approved more than $4.0 billion in SBLF financing to 332 lending institutions ($3.9 billion to 281 community banks and $104 million to 51 CDFIs). SBLF recipients have offices located in 47 states and the District of Columbia. The average financing was $12.1 million, ranging from $42,000 to $141.0 million. Of the 332 lending institutions which received financing, 137 institutions had participated in TARP's Community Development Capital Initiative or its Capital Purchase Program. These institutions received nearly $2.7 billion in SBLF financing (66.8% of the total). Treasury is required to publish monthly reports describing all transactions made under the SBLF program during the reporting period. It is also required to publish a semiannual report (each March and September) providing all projected costs and liabilities, operating expenses, and transactions made by the SBLF, including a list of all participating institutions and the amounts each institution has received under the program. Treasury must also publish a quarterly report describing how participating institutions have used the funds they have received.",
      "This dividend treatment differs from the TARP programs, in which many dividend payments were cumulative. This change in dividend treatment was driven by changes in capital requirements mandated by the Collins Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act. The amendment equalizes the consolidated capital requirements for Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies by requiring that, at a minimum, regulators apply the same capital and risk standards for FDIC-insured banks to bank holding companies. Under TARP, the FRB [Federal Reserve Board] and FDIC treated capital differently at the holding company and depository institution levels. The FRB treated cumulative securities issued by holding companies as Tier 1 capital, while FDIC treated non-cumulative securities issued by depository institutions as Tier 1 capital. In order to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act requirement that securities purchased from holding companies receive the same capital treatment as those purchased from depository institutions, Treasury made the dividends under SBLF non-cumulative. Additionally, given that Tier 1 capital must be perpetual and cannot have a mandatory redemption date, the 10-year repayment period in the Small Business Jobs Act cannot be enforced. Treasury addressed this issue by placing the following additional requirements and restrictions on participants who miss dividend payments: the participant's CEO [Chief Executive Office] and CFO [Chief Financial Officer] must provide written notice regarding the rationale of the board of directors (BOD) for not declaring a dividend; no repurchases may be affected and no dividends may be declared on any securities for the applicable quarter and the following three quarters; after four missed payments (consecutive or not), the issuer's BOD must certify in writing that the issuer used best efforts to declare and pay dividends appropriately; after five missed payments (consecutive or not), Treasury may appoint a representative to serve as an observer on the issuer's BOD; and after six missed payments (consecutive or not), Treasury may elect two directors to the issuer's BOD if the liquidation preference is $25 million or more.",
      "Stress tests are intended to ensure that banks hold enough capital to withstand a hypothetical market stress scenario, but arguably have the effect of acting as additional capital requirements with which banks must comply. Advanced approaches banks must maintain a fixed minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), an unweighted capital requirement that is more stringent than the leverage ratio facing smaller banks because it incorporates off-balance sheet exposures. A Congressional Research Service (CRS) analysis of large holding companies' regulatory filings indicates that, currently, 19 large and complex U.S. bank or thrift holding companies are classified as advanced approaches banks. G-SIBs must meet fixed enhanced SLR (eSLR) requirements, which sets the SLR higher for these banks. In addition, the G-SIBs are subject to an additional risk-weighted capital surcharge (on top of other risk-weighted capital requirements that all banks must meet) of between 1% and 4.5% based on the systemic importance of the institution. Whether these requirements are appropriately calibrated is a debated issue. Proponents of recalibrating some of these capital requirements argue that those requirements set at a fixed number—including the CCB and eSLR—are inefficient, because they do not reflect varying levels of risk posed by individual banks. Recalibration proponents also argue that compiling with these requirements in addition to stress test requirements is unnecessarily burdensome for banks. Opponents of proposals to relax current capital requirements facing large and profitable banks assert that doing so needlessly pares back important safeguards against bank failures and systemic instability. In response to concerns that fixed requirements do not adequately account for risk differences between institutions, the Fed has issued two proposals for public comment that would link individual large banks' requirements with other risk measures. One proposal would make bank CCB requirements a function of their stress tests results, and the other proposal would link large banks' eSLR requirements with individual G-SIB systemic importance scores."

According to the documentation, the Forest Service's obligations for fire incident cooperative agreements ranged from $412 million to $1.4 billion over a 10-year period. However, the preparation of the Cost Settlement Package, which is a critical component of these agreements, took several months to years to complete after the fire incident.

      "For example, there was no process and related control activities over the negotiation and review of (1) a fire incident master cooperative agreement, which is developed before a fire occurs, and (2) supplemental agreements, which are signed by all relevant parties after the start of a fire incident. These supplemental agreements detail, among other things, the terms for (1) fire department resource use, (2) financial arrangements, and (3) specific cost-sharing agreements. Another unique feature of fire incident cooperative agreements, which was not covered in process documents for its reimbursable agreements, was the preparation of the Cost Settlement Package. The preparation of this package does not start until after the fire has ended and the Forest Service has received and paid all bills. According to Forest Service officials, a fire incident is deemed to have ended when there are no more resources (firefighters and equipment) on the ground putting out the fire. However, this definition was not documented in the Forest Service’s manuals and handbooks in the Directive System. Based on our review of documentation that the Forest Service provided for four fire incidents, we found that for these incidents the Cost Settlement Packages and the billings took several months to years to complete after the fire incident. According to Forest Service officials, delays in preparing the Cost Settlement Package in many cases were due to parties involved in suppressing the fires taking a long time to submit their invoices to the Forest Service for payment. Because the preparation of Cost Settlement Packages was not included in the process documents, the Forest Service did not have a defined time frame for when, in relation to the end of the fire, the Cost Settlement Package must be completed. For example, in one case we reviewed, the bill for a cost settlement was sent 9 months after the fire occurred, and in another case, settlement occurred approximately 2 years after the fire occurred.",
      "The Forest Service did not have documented processes and related control activities for its fire incident cooperative agreements to reasonably assure the effectiveness and efficiency of its related fire incident operations and reliable reporting internally and externally. As part of the service’s mission objective to suppress wildland fires, Forest Service officials stated that they enter into 5-year agreements referred to as master cooperative agreements with federal, state, and other entities. These agreements document the framework for commitment and support efficient and effective coordination and cooperation among the parties in suppressing fires, when they occur. The master cooperative agreements do not require specific funding commitments as amounts are not yet known. These agreements vary from region to region because of the differing laws and regulations pertaining to the participating states and other entities. These variations can also result in different billing and collection processes between regions. When a fire occurs, supplemental agreements, which are based on the framework established in the applicable master cooperative agreements, are signed by relevant parties for each fire incident. These agreements establish the share of fire suppression costs incurred by the Forest Service and amounts related to entities that benefitted from those fire suppression efforts. These supplemental agreements require commitment and obligation of funds. As indicated in figure 2, the Forest Service’s obligations for fire suppression activities ranged from $412 million to $1.4 billion over the 10-year period from fiscal years 2007 through 2016. In response to our request for documentation of processes and related control activities over its fire incident cooperative agreements, Forest Service officials stated that processes and related control activities over reimbursable agreements were applicable to both fire incident cooperative agreements and RACAs. However, based on our review of the Forest Service’s processes and related control activities over its reimbursable agreements, we found that the unique features of fire incident cooperative agreements (as compared to features of RACAs) were not addressed in the processes and related controls for reimbursable agreements.",
      "The Forest Service lacked control activities over the segregation of incompatible duties performed by line officers and program managers for reimbursable agreements and any adjustments affecting the final disposition of related receivables. Field offices manage the majority of Forest Service projects, including authorizing the agreements and monitoring related collection. The Forest Service line officer for fire incident cooperative agreements and program managers for RACA at the RSA, unit, or field levels initiate and develop the terms of the agreements and are also responsible for any subsequent negotiation of the agreements. In the process of negotiating and settling costs, the line officer or program manager has the authority to cancel or change related receivables that they deemed uncollectible. For example, in a fire incident, the line officer at the region or field level is involved in both developing a Cost Share Agreement and after the fire incident has ended, negotiating the Cost Settlement Package with parties involved in the agreement to determine the final settlement amount that the Forest Service will be reimbursed for expenses paid in suppressing the fire incident. Therefore, the line officer is responsible for initiating the Cost Share Agreement, modifying the Cost Settlement Package, and changing or canceling the related receivable, which represent conflicting duties. We also found that the Forest Service did not have any mitigating controls, such as independent approval of any adjustments affecting the final disposition of receivables, to mitigate the risk of these incompatible duties. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks. Segregation of duties contributes to the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of control activities. To achieve segregation of key functions, management can divide responsibilities among different people to reduce the risk of error, misuse, or fraud.",
      "The lack of properly designed control activities for supervisory review of the desk guide and strategy to identify the amounts for fund transfers does not provide the Forest Service reasonable assurance that the objectives of the fund transfers—including mitigating the risk of a shortfall of funding for other critical Forest Service program activities, such as payroll or other day-to-day operating costs—will be efficiently and effectively achieved. The Forest Service enters into various reimbursable agreements with agencies within USDA, other federal agencies, state and local government agencies, and nongovernment entities to carry out its mission for public benefit. The reimbursable agreements may be for the Forest Service to provide goods and services to a third party or to receive goods and services from a third party, or may be a partnership agreement with a third party for a common goal. According to Forest Service officials, the two distinct types of Forest Service reimbursable agreements are (1) fire incident cooperative agreements and (2) reimbursable and advanced collection agreements (RACA). The Forest Service did not have documented processes and related control activities for its fire incident cooperative agreements to reasonably assure the effectiveness and efficiency of its related fire incident operations. In addition, processes and related control activities applicable to RACAs were not adequately described in applicable manuals and handbooks in the Directive System, to reasonably assure that control activities could be performed consistently and effectively. Further, certain RACA processes in the Directive System had not been timely reviewed by management and did not reflect current processes. Moreover, as previously discussed, SOPs and desk guides developed in field offices related to RACA processes were not in the Forest Service’s Directive System. Finally, the Forest Service lacked control activities segregating incompatible duties performed by line officers and program managers in creating reimbursable agreements and the final disposition of related receivables."

However, if CMS had used the average allowable amounts in 2016 ($11.45) as the basis for payment reductions, instead of the 2017 national limitation amounts, Medicare's payment rate for the test in 2018 would have been $13.04, resulting in an additional payment of $3.04. Assuming that the payment rate for the test in 2019 would have been reduced by 10% from the 2018 rate, and that the payment rate for the test in 2020 would have been reduced by 10% from the 2019 rate, what would be the estimated increase in Medicare expenditures for the test from 2018 through 2020, assuming that the utilization rates remain constant?",

      "For example, a hypothetical laboratory test with a 2017 CLFS national limitation amount of $10.00 and a median private-payer rate of $7.00 would result in CLFS rates of $9.00 in 2018, $8.10 in 2019, and $7.29 in 2020. Changes to median private-payer rates due to collecting more complete data or eliminating inaccurate data would have no effect on Medicare payment rates from 2018 through 2020 for this hypothetical test if they resulted in new median rates of $7.29 or less. Our analysis of the potential effects that collecting data from additional laboratories could have had on Medicare payment rates and expenditures found that the effect of CMS not collecting complete data would likely have been greater absent PAMA’s limits on annual reductions to Medicare payment rates. As a result, CMS may face challenges setting accurate Medicare rates if it does not collect complete data from all laboratories required to report in the future when PAMA allows for greater annual payment-rate reductions. To conduct this analysis, we used the private-payer data CMS collected to analyze the range of effects that collecting additional data could have on Medicare expenditures, assuming 2016 utilization rates remain constant. The extent of these effects depends on the amount of additional data CMS would need to collect to obtain complete data and whether the payment rates in these additional data would have been greater or less than the medians of the rates reported. For example, we estimated that if CMS needed to collect 20 percent more data for its collection to be complete, doing so could increase Medicare CLFS expenditures from 2018 through 2020 by as much as 3 percent or reduce them by as much as 3 percent depending on the payment rates in these additional data. However, if annual limits to Medicare payment-rate reductions were not applied, collecting these additional data could increase CLFS expenditures by as much as 9 percent or reduce them by as much as 9 percent. (See fig. 3 and app. II for additional information about these estimates.)",
      "3. data with payment rates that were 10 times greater than the 2017 national limitation amounts or 10 times less than these amounts, and 4. data from laboratories that may not have met the $12,500 low- expenditure threshold or that reported data from a hospital NPI instead of a laboratory NPI. We found that each of these four types of potentially inaccurate data would have changed estimated Medicare CLFS expenditures from 2018 through 2020 by 1 percent or less if CMS had instead excluded the data. To conduct this analysis, we recalculated Medicare rates after excluding each type of data and estimated Medicare expenditures assuming 2016 rates of utilization. Although weighted median private-payer rates were lower than Medicare’s 2017 national limitation amounts for 88 percent of tests, we estimated the total Medicare expenditures based on the 2018 CLFS would likely increase by 3 percent ($225 million overall) compared to 2016 expenditures, assuming test utilization remained at 2016 levels. This increase in estimated expenditures is due, in part, to CMS’s use of above-average payment rates as a baseline to calculate payment rates for those laboratory tests affected by PAMA’s annual payment-rate reduction limit of 10 percent. (See fig. 4.) When applying the 10-percent payment-rate reduction limit, CMS used as its starting point the 2017 national limitation amounts in order to set a single, national payment rate for each laboratory test. Thus, the Medicare payment rate for a test in 2018 could not be less than 90 percent of the test’s 2017 national limitation amount. However, prior to 2018, some payment rates were commonly lower than the national limitation amounts because they were based on the lesser of (1) the amount billed on claims, (2) the local fee for a geographic area, or (3) a national limitation amount, and because panel tests had different bundled payment rates. As a result, by reducing payment rates from national limitation amounts, CMS did not always reduce rates from what Medicare actually paid.",
      "Figure 1 below describes the percentage difference between these median payment rates and Medicare’s 2017 national limitation amounts for laboratory tests. The final payment rates that CMS calculated, which included the 10- percent, phased in, payment-rate reductions, will remain in effect until December 31, 2020; PAMA requires CMS to calculate new payment rates for the CLFS every 3 years. Reporting entities will next be required to submit data on private-payer rates to CMS in early 2020, for final payments made from January 1, 2019 through June 30, 2019. PAMA capped any reductions for the second 3-year cycle after implementation to a maximum of 15 percent per year. CMS did not collect private-payer data from all laboratories required to report this information and did not estimate how much data was not reported by these laboratories, according to agency officials. CMS relied on laboratories to determine whether they met data reporting requirements and submit data accordingly. CMS emphasized the importance of receiving data from all laboratories required to report by stating that it is critical that CMS collect complete data on private-payer rates in order to set accurate Medicare rates. However, agency officials told us that CMS did not receive data from all laboratories required to report. They also told us that CMS did not have the information available to estimate how much data was missing because not all laboratories reported or the extent to which the data collected were representative of all of the data that laboratories were required to report. Prior to collecting private-payer data, CMS estimated that laboratories subject to reporting requirements would receive more than 90 percent of CLFS expenditures to physician-office laboratories and independent laboratories. Specifically, based on its analysis of 2013 Medicare expenditures, CMS estimated that reporting requirements would apply to the laboratories that received 92 percent of CLFS payments to physician- office laboratories and 99 percent of CLFS payments to independent laboratories.",
      "Panel tests, in particular, frequently received bundled payment rates that differed substantially from national limitation amounts associated with their billing codes prior to 2018. We compared national limitation amounts, which represent maximum Medicare payment rates for tests, with the average amounts Medicare allowed for payment in 2016, which reflect actual Medicare payment rates. For example, figure 5 below shows that the 2017 national limitation amount for comprehensive metabolic panel tests ($14.49) was substantially higher than both the average amount Medicare allowed for payment in 2016 ($11.45) and the median payment rate laboratories reported receiving from private payers ($9.08). As a result, using the 2017 national limitation amount as a basis for payment reductions caused Medicare’s payment rate to increase from an average allowed amount of $11.45 in 2016, to a payment rate of $13.04 in 2018, instead of decreasing towards a lower median private- payer rate of $9.08. By increasing average payment rates rather than phasing in reductions to rates, CMS’s implementation may lead to paying more than necessary for some tests. Federal standards for internal control for information and communications require agency management to use quality information to achieve its objectives. Basing reductions on national limitation amounts rather than more relevant information on how much Medicare actually paid—such as the average allowable amounts in 2016, for example—could result in Medicare paying more than necessary by $733 million from 2018 through 2020, according to our estimates. In implementing PAMA, CMS eliminated bundled rates for panel tests that lack billing codes and started paying separately for each component test instead. CMS also implemented the 2018 CLFS in a manner that could lead to unbundling payment rates for panel tests with billing codes. If payment rates for all panel tests were unbundled, we estimated that Medicare expenditures could increase by $218 million for panel tests that lack billing codes and by as much as $10.1 billion for panel tests with billing codes from 2018 through 2020."

      "In addition to country-specific uses, OCO/GWOT-designated funds were also appropriated for the Global Security Contingency Fund. All budgetary legislation is subject to a set of enforcement procedures associated with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-344 ), as well as other rules, such as those imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-125 ) as amended. Those rules provide mechanisms to enforce both procedural and statutory limits on discretionary spending. Enacted on August 2, 2011, the BCA as amended sets limits on defense and nondefense spending. As part of an agreement to increase the statutory limit on public debt, the BCA aimed to reduce annual federal budget deficits by a total of at least $2.1 trillion from FY2012 through FY2021, with approximately half of the savings to come from defense. The spending limits (or caps ) apply separately to defense and nondefense discretionary budget authority. The caps are enforced by a mechanism called sequestration . Sequestration automatically cancels previously enacted appropriations (a form of budget authority) by an amount necessary to reach prespecified levels. The BCA effectively exempted certain types of discretionary spending from the statutory limits, including funding designated for OCO/GWOT. As a result, Congress and the President have designated funding for OCO to support activities that, in previous times, had been funded within the base budget. This was done, in part, as a response to the discretionary spending limits enacted by the BCA. By designating funding for OCO for certain activities not directly related to contingency operations, Congress and the President can effectively continue to increase topline defense, foreign affairs, and other related discretionary spending without triggering sequestration. Congress has repeatedly amended the legislation to raise the spending limits (thus lowering its deficit-reduction effect by corresponding amounts). Congress has passed four bills that revised the automatic spending caps initially established by the BCA, including the following: American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240 ); Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA 2013; P.L. 113-67 ); Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015; P.L. 114-74 ); and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-123 ).",
      "DOE science programs would be reduced by $1.039 billion (-16%). Programs targeted by the budget for elimination or phaseout include energy efficiency grants, the Advanced Research Projects Agency—Energy (ARPA-E), and loan guarantee programs. Funding would be reduced for USACE by $2.172 billion (-31%), and Reclamation and CUP by $462 million (-29%). Congress did not enact similar reductions included in the FY2018 and FY2019 budget requests. Congressional consideration of the annual Energy and Water Development appropriations bill is affected by certain procedural and statutory budget enforcement measures. These consist primarily of limits associated with the budget resolution on total discretionary spending and allocations of this amount that apply to spending under the jurisdiction of each appropriations subcommittee. Statutory budget enforcement is derived from the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ). The BCA established separate limits on defense and nondefense discretionary spending. These limits are in effect for each of the fiscal years from FY2012 through FY2021, and are primarily enforced by an automatic spending reduction process called sequestration, in which a breach of a spending limit would trigger across-the-board cuts within that spending category. The BCA's statutory discretionary spending limits were increased for FY2018 and FY2019 by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-123 ), enacted February 9, 2018. However, the BCA discretionary spending limits have not been increased for FY2020. As a result, the limits currently in place for FY2020 are substantially lower than the limits that were in place for FY2019. For discretionary defense spending, the FY2020 limit drops from $647 billion to $576 billion (-11%), while the nondefense limit drops from $597 billion to $542 billion (-9%). A bill to raise the defense and nondefense spending limits for FY2020 and FY2021 was reported by the House Budget Committee April 5, 2019 ( H.R. 2021 , H.Rept. 116-35 ).",

The Budget Control Act, Discretionary Spending Caps, and Adjustments The Budget Control Act established enforceable discretionary limits, or caps, for defense and nondefense spending for each fiscal year from FY2012 through FY2021. Subsequent legislation, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, amended those caps. Most of the budget for DHS is considered nondefense spending. In addition, the Budget Control Act allows for adjustments that would raise the statutory caps to cover funding for overseas contingency operations/Global War on Terror, emergency spending, and, to a limited extent, disaster relief and appropriations for continuing disability reviews and control of health care fraud and abuse. Three of the four justifications outlined in the Budget Control Act for adjusting the caps on discretionary budget authority have played a role in DHS's appropriations process. Two of these—emergency spending and overseas contingency operations/Global War on Terror—are not limited. The third justification—disaster relief—is limited. Under the Budget Control Act, the allowable adjustment for disaster relief was determined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), using the following formula until FY2019: Limit on disaster relief cap adjustment for the fiscal year = Rolling average of the disaster relief spending over the last ten fiscal years (throwing out the high and low years) + the unused amount of the potential adjustment for disaster relief from the previous fiscal year. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the above formula, increasing the allowable size of the adjustment by adding 5% of the amount of emergency-designated funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act, calculated by OMB as $6.296 billion."

      "The request amounted to a $0.29 billion (0.6%) decrease from the $47.72 billion in annual appropriations enacted for FY2018 through the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 , Division F). The Trump Administration also requested discretionary funding for DHS components that does not count against discretionary spending limits set by the Budget Control Act (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ) and is not reflected in the above totals. The Administration requested an additional $6.65 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in disaster relief funding, as defined by the BCA, and in the budget request for the Department of Defense, $165 million in Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror designated funding (OCO), to be transferred to the Coast Guard. On June 21, 2018, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported out S. 3109 , the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, accompanied by S.Rept. 115-283 . Committee-reported S. 3109 included $48.33 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for FY2019. This was $901 million (1.9%) above the level requested by the Administration, and $611 million (1.3%) above the enacted level for FY2018. The Senate committee-reported bill also included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, and $163 million in OCO-designated funding directly for the Coast Guard, as had been done in FY2018, rather than as a transfer, as had been requested by the Administration. This bill was never taken up for action on the Senate floor. On July 26, 2018, the House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 6776 , its version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019. H.Rept. 115-948 was filed September 12, 2018. Committee-reported H.R. 6776 included $51.44 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. The House committee-reported bill included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, but unlike S. 3109 , did not include the OCO funding for the Coast Guard.",
      "This bill did not see action on the House floor. As some of the annual appropriations for FY2019 remained unfinished, a consolidated appropriations bill that included a continuing resolution was passed by Congress and signed into law on September 28, 2018, as P.L. 115-245 . The continuing resolution (Division C) continued funding for DHS at a rate of operations equal to that of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018, with some exceptions. The continuing resolution was extended through December 21, 2018, at which point it expired, and annual appropriations for DHS lapsed, resulting in a partial shutdown of DHS for 35 days. Continuing appropriations were restored at the FY2018 rate of operations with the enactment of P.L. 116-4 on January 25, 2019. On February 14, 2019, the House took up H.J.Res. 31 , a consolidated appropriations bill that included eight annual appropriations bills. Division A, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, included $49.41 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.69 billion (3.5%) more than had been provided for FY2018, and $2.04 billion more than had been requested by the Administration in February 2018. In addition to that total, the bill included $12 billion designated for the costs of major disasters—$5.35 billion (80.4%) more than had been requested, and the requested $165 million in OCO funding appropriated for the Coast Guard operating budget, rather than a transfer from the Navy. The bill passed the House by a vote of 300-128, and the Senate that same day by a vote of 83-16. The President signed it into law the next day. Generally, the homeland security appropriations bill includes all annual appropriations provided for DHS, allocating resources to every departmental component. Discretionary appropriations provide roughly two-thirds to three-fourths of the annual funding for DHS operations, depending how one accounts for disaster relief spending and funding for overseas contingency operations.",
      "It did not direct the rescinded funds to be applied to the clean water SRF, as proposed by the House. The $2.03 billion total in the bill for EPA water infrastructure programs and projects was $386 million more than was requested by the President, but $301 million less than Congress appropriated for FY2005. Further, the funding amounts specified in P.L. 109-54 were reduced slightly. First, a provision of P.L. 109-54 , Section 439, mandated an across-the-board rescission of 0.476% for any discretionary appropriation in that bill. Second, in December 2005 Congress enacted P.L. 109-148 , the FY2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, and Section 3801 of that bill mandated a 1% across-the-board rescission for discretionary accounts in any FY2006 appropriation act (except for discretionary authority of the Department of Veterans Affairs). As a result of these two rescissions, the final levels for the STAG account were $887 million for clean water SRF grants; $838 million for drinking water SRF grants; $281 million for 259 earmarked grants in listed communities, Alaska Native Villages, and along the U.S.-Mexico border; and $1.11 billion for categorical state grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. FY2006 EPA water infrastructure programs and projects thus total $2.0 billion. On October 28, President Bush requested that Congress rescind $2.3 billion from 55 \"lower-priority federal programs and excess funds,\" including $166 million from clean water SRF monies. In the end, Congress did not endorse the specific request to reduce clean water SRF appropriations. The two rescissions resulting from P.L. 109-54 and P.L. 109-148 totaled a $13.2 million reduction from the $900 million specified in the EPA appropriations act. President Bush presented the Administration's FY2007 budget request in February 2006, asking Congress to appropriate $1.570 billion for EPA's water infrastructure programs. The FY2007 request sought $687.6 million for clean water SRF grants, $841.5 million for drinking water SRF grants, and $40.6 million for special projects in Alaska Native Villages, Puerto Rico, and along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Title II, Security, Enforcement, and Investigations, contains appropriations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Coast Guard (USCG), and the U.S. Secret Service (USSS). Title II funding represents the majority of DHS's budget, comprising roughly three-quarters of the funding appropriated annually for the department. For FY2018, these components received $39.52 billion in net discretionary funding, as part of $47.13 billion in projected total budget authority. This included $1.06 billion in supplemental appropriations. The Trump Administration formally requested $38.41 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for components included in this title, as part of a total budget request for these components of $47.08 billion for FY2019. The funding request was $45 million (0.1%) less than the amount provided for FY2018, setting aside FY2018 supplemental appropriations. Again setting aside FY2018 supplemental appropriations, the total resources proposed for FY2019 was $1.01 billion (2.2%) more than projected for FY2018. The Administration reportedly sought additional funding in this title for construction of border barriers, above the formally requested level. In January 2019, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget sent a letter to congressional leaders officially seeking an additional $4.1 billion. Those amounts are not included in these comparative calculations or in the table below. Senate Appropriations Committee-reported S. 3109 included $38.68 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for the components funded in this title. This was $271 million (0.7%) more than formally requested by the Trump Administration and $227 million (0.6%) more than the amount provided for FY2018, setting aside FY2018 supplemental appropriations. The total budgetary resources projected under S. 3109 were $614 million (1.3%) less than the Administration's request (largely due to rejection of a proposed TSA fee increase), but $391 million (0.8%) more than projected for FY2018, again setting aside FY2018 supplemental appropriations."

      "The federal government has been challenged in securing federal systems and information. Specifically, we have reported that federal agencies have experienced challenges in implementing government-wide cybersecurity initiatives, addressing weaknesses in their information systems and responding to cyber incidents on their systems. This is particularly concerning given that the emergence of increasingly sophisticated threats and continuous reporting of cyber incidents underscores the continuing and urgent need for effective information security. As such, it is important that federal agencies take appropriate steps to better ensure they have effectively implemented programs to protect their information and systems. We have identified three actions that the agencies can take. Improve implementation of government-wide cybersecurity initiatives. Specifically, in January 2016, we reported that DHS had not ensured that the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) had fully satisfied all intended system objectives related to intrusion detection and prevention, information sharing, and analytics. In addition, in February 2017, we reported that the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center’s (NCCIC) functions were not being performed in adherence with the principles set forth in federal laws. We noted that, although NCCIC was sharing information about cyber threats in the way it should, the center did not have metrics to measure that the information was timely, relevant and actionable, as prescribed by law. For more information on this action area, see appendix VI. Address weaknesses in federal information security programs. We have previously identified a number of weaknesses in agencies’ protection of their information and information systems. For example, over the past 2 years, we have reported that: most of the 24 agencies covered by the CFO Act had weaknesses in each of the five major categories of information system controls (i.e., access controls, configuration management controls, segregation of duties, contingency planning, and agency-wide security management); three agencies—the Securities Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Food and Drug Administration—had not effectively implemented aspects of their information security programs, which resulted in weaknesses in these agencies’ security controls; information security weaknesses in selected high-impact systems at four agencies—the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, OPM, and the Department of Veterans Affairs—were cited as a key reason that the agencies had not effectively implemented elements of their information security programs; DOD’s process for monitoring the implementation of cybersecurity guidance had weaknesses and resulted in the closure of certain tasks (such as completing cyber risk assessments) before they were fully implemented; and agencies had not fully defined the role of their Chief Information Security Officers, as required by FISMA.",
      "Of the roughly 3,000 recommendations made since 2010, nearly 1,000 had not been implemented as of August 2018. We have also designated 35 as priority recommendations, and as of August 2018, 31 had not been implemented. The federal government and the nation’s critical infrastructure are dependent on IT systems and electronic data, which make them highly vulnerable to a wide and evolving array of cyber-based threats. Securing these systems and data is vital to the nation’s security, prosperity, and well-being. Nevertheless, the security over these systems and data is inconsistent and urgent actions are needed to address ongoing cybersecurity and privacy challenges. Specifically, the federal government needs to implement a more comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and improve its oversight, including maintaining a qualified cybersecurity workforce; address security weaknesses in federal systems and information and enhance cyber incident response efforts; bolster the protection of cyber critical infrastructure; and prioritize efforts to protect individual’s privacy and PII. Until our recommendations are addressed and actions are taken to address the four challenges we identified, the federal government, the national critical infrastructure, and the personal information of U.S. citizens will be increasingly susceptible to the multitude of cyber-related threats that exist.

      "For WSP, the Senate committee measure, like the House committee bill, would provide $2.38 billion of total account funds through OCO. The FY2019 enacted appropriations provided a total of $4.10 billion for WSP and $1.98 billion for ESCM, for a total funding level of $6.08 billion in budget authority for these accounts. Like the House and Senate committee bills, P.L. 116-6 funded ESCM exclusively through the base budget. Of the $4.10 billion provided for WSP in the law, $2.63 billion was done so through OCO. Had the Administration's request been enacted, it would have marked a decline of 2% for WSP and 28% for ESCM relative to the FY2018 figures of approximately $3.76 billion and $2.31 billion, respectively. The enacted legislation provided 9% more funding for WSP and 15% less for ESCM relative to FY2018 levels. Over the past several years, Congress has provided no-year appropriations for both WSP and ESCM, thereby authorizing the State Department to indefinitely retain appropriated funds beyond the fiscal year for which they were appropriated. As a result, the department has carried over large balances of unexpired, unobligated funds each year that it is authorized to obligate for programs within both accounts when it deems appropriate to do so. For example, for FY2018, the State Department carried over more than $7.6 billion in previously appropriated funds for ESCM. Both the House and Senate committee bills would have continued this practice with respect to WSP, and the Senate committee bill would have continued with respect to ESCM, as well. The House committee bill, if enacted, would have provided that all funds appropriated for ESCM remained available until September 30, 2023, rather than indefinitely. P.L. 116-6 provided no-year appropriations for WSP. For ESCM, the law stipulated that while funds for worldwide security upgrades and for purposes of acquisition and construction would remain available until expended, all other monies within this account (such as funds for preserving, maintaining, repairing, and planning for real property that State Department owns) would remain available only until September 30, 2023.",
      "On January 25, an agreement was reached to continue funding for SFOPS and other appropriations that had lapsed through February 15, at the FY2018 level ( P.L. 116-5 ). Enacted Legislation . On February 14 Congress passed, and the President later signed into law, a full year appropriation ( P.L. 116-6 , Division F) that included $54.38 billion in total SFOPS funding, a 0.3% decrease from the FY2018 funding level and about 30% more than the Administration's request. Of that total, $16.46 billion was for State Department operations and related agencies; $37.92 billion for foreign operations accounts. About 14.7%, or $8.0 billion, was designated as OCO. The State Department sought to cut funding for the Department of State and Related Agency category by 19% in FY2019 from FY2018 funding levels, to $13.26 billion. Conversely, both the House and Senate committee bills sought to maintain funding near previous fiscal year levels. The House committee bill would have increased funding in this category to $16.38 billion, or 0.4% above the FY2018 funding level. The Senate committee bill would have raised funding to $16.34 billion, around $40 million less than the House committee bill and approximately 0.1% more than the FY2018 funding level. Similar to the House and Senate committee bills, the FY2019 enacted appropriation ( P.L. 116-6 ) maintained funding for the State Department and Related Agency category slightly above FY2018 funding level. It provided $16.46 billion for this category, or 0.9% more than the F2018 level. The State Department's request sought to fund the entirety of this category through base (or enduring) funding. Following passage of the BBA and the resulting increase in discretionary spending cap levels for FY2018 and FY2019, the State Department moved the $3.69 billion request for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) in this category into the base budget request. Both the House and Senate committee bills sought to retain OCO funding within the Department of State and Related Agency category.",
      "Congress has appropriated a total of $68.8 billion for DOD OCO funding in FY2019, including the following amounts: $67.9 billion in defense funds provided in the Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 115-245 ), which Congress passed on September 26, 2018; and $921 million in defense funds provided in the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 115-244 ), which Congress passed on September, 21, 2018. For the Department of State and USAID, as well as the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard, FY2019 OCO levels have not yet been determined. They remain at prorated FY2018 levels because of continuing resolutions (CR) to fund certain agencies through December 21, 2018. The FY2019 House and Senate SFOPS bills ( H.R. 6385 and S. 3108 , 115 th Congress) would have appropriated approximately $8 billion in OCO-designated funding for various priorities. The House committee-reported version of the Homeland Security appropriations bill ( H.R. 6776 , 115 th Congress) would not have appropriated any OCO/GWOT funding for the Coast Guard, while the Senate committee-reported version of the bill ( S. 3109 , 115 th Congress) would have appropriated $165 million for OCO/GWOT funding for the Coast Guard. Any decision by the 116 th Congress to change discretionary defense and nondefense spending limits that remain in effect for FY2020 and FY2021 under the Budget Control Act (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ) could impact future OCO funding levels. Lawmakers may consider the following questions: Will Congress keep the BCA as is and rely on OCO funding that is not subject to the caps to meet agency requirements? Will Congress repeal the BCA and use less OCO funding? Will Congress amend the BCA limits for future years and continue to use OCO funding, as it has in the past? Will Congress significantly reduce DOD and international affairs funding to stay within the BCA caps and not use OCO funding?",
      "The House committee bill would have provided $3.03 billion for OCO, or around 28% less than the FY2018 figure of $4.18 billion. The Senate committee bill would have provided $4.11 billion, which constituted about 2% less than FY2018 level. While the House committee bill would have afforded approximately $1.08 billion less for OCO than the Senate committee bill, the House committee bill provided around $1.12 billion more in enduring funding ($13.35 billion) than the Senate committee bill ($12.23 billion). As with the House and Senate committee bills, P.L. 116-6 retained OCO funding for the Department of State and Related Agency category. The law provided a total of $4.37 billion for OCO, or 4.5% more than the FY2018 funding level. While the law provided more for OCO than either the Senate or House committee bills, it provided less in enduring funding ($12.09 billion). Areas where the State Department's proposed cuts were focused included the diplomatic security accounts (the Worldwide Security Protection programmatic allocation within the Diplomatic Programs account and, separately, the Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance account), Contributions to International Organizations, and Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities. In most cases, P.L. 116-6 , in a manner similar to the House and Senate committee bills, maintained annual budget authority for these accounts closer to the FY2018 funding levels than the Administration requested (see following sections for more detailed analysis). The State Department also requested $246.2 million to implement the Leadership and Modernization Impact Initiative, which serves as the implementation phase of the department's \"Redesign\" efforts. While neither the House nor the Senate committee bill directly addressed the Impact Initiative, both included provisions enabling Congress to conduct oversight of any broader reorganization efforts at the department. The enacted legislation, P.L. 116-6 , took the same approach. Table 3 provides an overview of proposed changes to selected accounts within the State Department and Related Agency category.",
      "The request amounted to a $0.29 billion (0.6%) decrease from the $47.72 billion in annual appropriations enacted for FY2018 through the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 , Division F).

    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "The operating balance is defined as total receipts minus (1) capital outlays not financed by medium- and long-term debt issuance, (2) total current expenditures less depreciation, (3) current surplus of state and local government enterprises, and (4) net social insurance fund balance. Alternative indicators of fiscal balance include net saving and net lending or borrowing. Net saving is the difference between current receipts and current expenditures. Since current expenditures exclude capital investment but include a depreciation measure, net saving can be thought of as a measure of the extent to which governments are covering their current operations from current receipts. Net lending or borrowing is the difference between total receipts and total expenditures, and is analogous to the federal unified surplus or deficit. Total receipts differ from current receipts because they include capital transfer receipts. Total expenditures differ from current expenditures because they include capital investment, capital transfer payments, and net purchases of nonproduced assets. However, they exclude fixed capital consumption. The former three categories are cash expenditures, while the latter is a noncash charge. Net lending or net borrowing represents the governments’ cash surplus or borrowing requirement. This measure is normally negative because governments borrow to finance their capital investment (and sometimes to finance current operations as well). The following equations describe how we simulated state and local government receipts and expenditures, as well as the intermediate variables used in those simulations. For this update, we started with historical data for 2017, or the most recent year available, and then simulated each variable for each year from 2018 through 2092 (the simulation period). To simulate state and local government receipts and expenditures, we use simulations of various national-level demographic, macroeconomic, and health care variables derived from projections produced by CBO, CMS, and the OASDI Trustees, and otherwise derived using our own assumptions (see table 2).",
      "Conversely, if receipts exceed expenditures and the sector is a net lender, its net financial investment (the net change in financial assets minus the net change in financial liabilities) must equal the budget surplus. The relationship between budget outcomes and the sector’s financial position is shown in the following accounting identity: total receipts – total expenditures = change in financial assets – change in financial liabilities. The sector’s financial liabilities include short-, medium-, and long-term debt; trade payables; and loans from the federal government, so the accounting identity can be rewritten as follows: total receipts – total expenditures = change in financial assets – change in medium- and long-term debt – change in trade payables – change in federal government loans – change in short term debt. For a given difference between total receipts and total expenditures, various combinations of changes in financial assets and changes in financial liabilities can satisfy this identity. However, we assumed that financial assets grow at the same rate as U.S. GDP, that medium- and long-term debt outstanding is determined using the historical relationship described in table 7, that federal government loans to state and local governments are determined using the historical relationship described in table 7, and that trade payables grow at the same rate as other state and local government consumption spending. If the first four terms on the right hand side of the identity are already determined, then only the fifth term— the change in short-term debt—is free to satisfy this identity. As discussed above, our indicators of fiscal balance are operating balance, net saving, and net lending or borrowing. This approach is similar to the approach we have used in prior model updates. Recall that we defined operating balance as follows: operating balance = total receipts – (gross investment + capital transfer payments + net purchases of nonproduced assets – medium- and long-term debt issuance) – (current expenditures – consumption of general government fixed assets) – current surplus of state and local government enterprises – net social insurance fund balance. By substituting for total receipts and current expenditures using the relationships described above and rearranging terms, we can also calculate operating balance using a formula that more easily identifies its revenue components—the items in the first set of parentheses—and expenditure components—the items in the second set of parentheses: operating balance = (current tax revenues + estate and gift tax revenues + social insurance fund contributions + income receipts from assets + current transfers + federal investment grants + medium- and long-term debt issuance) – (compensation of general government employees + social benefit payments + interest payments + gross investment + capital transfer payments + net purchases of nonproduced assets + other general government consumption expenditures + subsidy payments + net social insurance fund balance)."

      "Without guidance specifying that agile projects track these metrics, the projects may not do so and the CIO may be limited in his knowledge of the progress being made on these projects. Workforce planning and management is essential for ensuring that federal agencies have the talent, skill, and experience mix they need to execute their missions and program goals. To help agencies effectively conduct workforce planning and management, the Office of Personnel Management, the Chief Human Capital Officers Council, DHS, the Secret Service, and we have identified numerous leading practices related to five workforce areas: strategic planning, recruitment and hiring, training and development, employee morale, and performance management. Table 6 identifies the five workforce areas and 15 selected leading practices associated with these areas (3 practices within each area). Of the five selected workforce planning and management areas, the Secret Service had substantially implemented two of the areas and minimally implemented three of the areas for its IT workforce. In addition, of the 15 selected leading practices associated with these workforce planning and management areas, the Secret Service had fully implemented 3 practices, partly implemented 8 practices, and did not implement any aspects of 4 practices. Table 7 summarizes the extent to which the Secret Service had implemented for its IT workforce the five selected workforce planning and management areas and 15 selected leading practices associated with those areas, as of June 2018. Strategic workforce planning is an essential activity that an agency needs to conduct to ensure that its human capital program aligns with its current and emerging mission and programmatic goals, and that the agency is able to meet its future needs. We previously identified numerous leading practices related to IT strategic workforce planning, including that an organization should (1) establish and maintain a strategic workforce planning process, including developing all competency and staffing needs; (2) regularly assess competency and staffing needs, and analyze the IT workforce to identify gaps in those areas; and (3) develop strategies and plans to address gaps in competencies and staffing.",
      "When effectively implemented, IT workforce planning and management activities can facilitate the successful accomplishment of an agency’s mission. However, the Secret Service had not fully implemented all of the 15 selected practices for its IT workforce for any of the five areas— strategic planning, recruitment and hiring, training and development, employee morale, and performance management. The Secret Service’s lack of (1) a strategic workforce planning process, including the identification of all required knowledge and skills, assessment of competency gaps, and targeted strategies to address specific gaps in competencies and staffing; (2) targeted recruiting activities, including metrics to monitor the effectiveness of the recruitment program and adjustment of the recruitment program and hiring efforts based on metrics; (3) a training program, including the identification of required training for IT staff, ensuring that staff take required training, and assessment of performance data regarding the training program; and (4) a performance management system that includes all relevant technical competencies, greatly limits its ability to ensure the timely and effective acquisition and maintenance of the Secret Service’s IT infrastructure and services. On the other hand, by monitoring program performance and conducting reviews at predetermined checkpoints for one program and three projects associated with the IITT investment, in accordance with leading practices, the Secret Service and DHS provided important oversight needed to guide that program and those projects. Measuring projects on leading agile metrics also provided the Secret Service CIO with important information on project performance. We are making the following 13 recommendations to the Director of the Secret Service: The Director should ensure that the CIO establishes and documents an IT acquisition review process that ensures the CIO or the CIO’s delegate reviews all contracts containing IT, as appropriate.

However, some stakeholders have suggested alternative approaches to address the issue of early withdrawals, particularly in the context of emergency savings and hardship withdrawals. For instance, a stakeholder noted that incorporating emergency savings features into 401(k) plans could help participants absorb economic shocks and better prepare for both short-term financial needs and long-term retirement planning. Another stakeholder suggested that replacing hardship withdrawals with hardship loans could reduce early withdrawals, as the loan balance could be repaid to the account, thereby reducing the permanent removal of funds from the retirement system. Which of the following options would likely have the most significant impact on reducing early withdrawals from 401(k) plans, considering the potential benefits of emergency savings and hardship loans?",

      "D) Mandating automatic contributions to an emergency savings account, with a minimum balance requirement to qualify for hardship withdrawals"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "Some stakeholders also said emergency savings accounts could be funded with after-tax participant contributions to eliminate the tax implications when withdrawing money from the account. However, another stakeholder said emergency savings contributions could reduce contributions to a 401(k) plan. In the United States, the amount of aggregate savings in retirement accounts continues to grow, with nearly $17 trillion invested in 401(k) plans and IRAs. Early access to retirement savings in these plans may incentivize plan participation, increase participant contributions, and provide participants with a way to address their financial needs. However, billions of dollars continue to leave the retirement system early. Although these withdrawals represent a small percentage of overall assets in these accounts, they can erode or even deplete an individual’s retirement savings, especially if the retirement account represents their sole source of savings. Employers have implemented plan policies that seek to balance the short- term benefits of providing participants early access to their accounts with the long-term need to build retirement savings. However, the way plan sponsors treat outstanding loans after a participant separates from employment has the potential to adversely affect retirement savings. In the event of unexpected job loss or separation, plan loans can leave participants liable for additional taxes. Currently, the incidence and amount of loan offsets in 401(k) plans cannot be determined due to the way DOL collects data from plan sponsors. Additional information on loan offsets would provide insight into how plan loan features might affect long-term retirement savings. Without clear data on the incidence of these loan offsets, which plan sponsors are generally required to include, (but not itemize) on the Form 5500, the overall extent of unrepaid plan loans in 401(k) plans cannot be known. To better identify the incidence and amount of loan offsets in 401(k) plans nationwide, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor direct the Assistant Secretary for EBSA, in coordination with IRS, to revise the Form 5500 to require plan sponsors to report qualified plan loan offsets as a separate line item distinct from other types of distributions.",
      "For example, some stakeholders suggested narrowing the definition of a hardship to exclude the purchase of a primary residence or for postsecondary education costs. In addition, one stakeholder said alternatives exist to finance home purchases (mortgages) and postsecondary education (student loans). Stakeholders noted that eliminating the purchase of a primary residence and postsecondary education costs from the IRS safe harbor would make hardship withdrawals a tool more strictly used to avoid sudden and unforeseen economic shocks. In combination with the two exclusions, one stakeholder suggested consideration be given to either reducing or eliminating the additional 10 percent tax for early distributions that may apply to hardship withdrawals. Replacing hardship withdrawals with hardship loans: Stakeholders said replacing a hardship withdrawal, which permanently removes money from the retirement system, with a no-interest hardship loan, which would be repaid to the account, would reduce early withdrawals. Under this suggestion, if the loan were not repaid within this predetermined time frame, the remaining loan balance could be considered a deemed distribution and treated as income (similar to the way a hardship withdrawal is treated now). Incorporating emergency savings features into 401(k) plans: Stakeholders said incorporating an emergency savings account into the 401(k) plan structure may help participants absorb economic shocks and better prepare for both short-term financial needs and long-term retirement planning. (See fig. 3.) In addition, stakeholders said participants with emergency savings accounts could be better prepared to avoid high interest rate credit options, such as credit cards or payday loans, in the event of an economic shock. Stakeholders had several ideas for implementing emergency savings accounts. For example, one stakeholder suggested that, were it allowed, plan sponsors could revise automatic account features to include automatic contributions to an emergency savings account."

      "This new requirement poses a potentially sizeable investment for the agency with an estimated cost of X-ray machines of about $24,000 and magnetometers of about $4,000 each. FAA may need such equipment at all its higher-level facilities. However, the ISC Standard requires that agencies conduct risk assessments first to justify their needs. Without conducting risk assessments, FAA managers could unnecessarily use resources by installing such equipment in all higher-level air traffic facilities when there may be higher priority needs A USDA security specialist decided, despite an ISC baseline requirement that higher–level facilities have X-ray machines, not to recommend an X-ray machine at a higher-level Forest Service facility. The specialist reasoned that unlike other federal buildings with numerous unknown visitors, this facility receives mostly known individuals and a limited number of visitors. The ISC Standard allows for professional judgement; however, the ISC requires that agencies document deviations from the baseline set of countermeasures. Reducing the facility’s level of protection without documenting an assessment of risk could result in no record of the basis of the decision for current and future facility managers and security officials to review or use as justification in the case of a question of compliance. In another case, we found that one higher-level facility did not have access control for employees or visitors nor did it have armed guard patrols. The facility manager told us that intelligence and a history without incidents gave leadership reason to believe that these measures were not needed and that therefore the agency did not require and would not fund such protective measures for this facility—in effect, accepting the risks to the facility. Security officials said they also had the same understanding and did not document the matter in the assessment report even though agency policy and the ISC Standard require written documentation when officials deviate from the baseline requirement.",
      "USDA security officials said that they have revised the assessment-reporting format to include this risk calculation and trained their specialists to measure risk in this way. USDA officials provided us with a new assessment template that addresses all 33 undesirable events and includes measuring risk. Additionally, USDA officials said that they are revising their outdated physical security manual and expect to complete it by April 2018. With a revised manual and application of the new assessment template, USDA should be better positioned to assess risk at its facilities. When agencies do not use methodologies that fully align with the ISC Standard, they could face deleterious effects, ranging from facilities having inappropriate levels of protection to agencies having an inability to make informed resource allocation decisions for their physical security needs. Specifically, the ISC Standard states that facilities may face the effect of either having (1) less protection than needed resulting in inadequate security or (2) more protection than needed resulting in an unnecessary use of resources. The ISC Standard also states that these effects can be negated by determining the proper protection according to a risk assessment. Identified excess resources in one risk area then can be reallocated to underserved areas, thus ensuring the most cost- effective security program is implemented. As an illustration of such potential effects, we found that two agencies assessing two higher-level facilities came to two different conclusions in terms of their need for X-ray machines to screen for guns, knives, and other prohibitive items in federal facilities. Specifically, one agency based its decision on a policy that does not deviate from the ISC’s baseline set of countermeasures, and the other agency based its decision on professional judgement that deviated from the ISC’s baseline set of countermeasures. Neither agency based its decision on a risk assessment nor documented its decision—both ISC requirements, specifically: Without conducting a risk assessment, FAA recently expanded a policy requirement calling for all higher-level facilities to have X-ray machines and magnetometers."

      "In fiscal year 2002, it cost Puerto Rico $2.7 billion to service its debt, representing about 12 percent of Puerto Rico’s $21.6 billion in total public revenue for that year. By fiscal year 2014, Puerto Rico’s annual debt service cost rose to $5.0 billion, representing just over 15 percent of Puerto Rico’s $32.5 billion in total public revenue for that year. Following years of expenditures that exceeded revenue, and a growing debt burden, in August 2015, Puerto Rico failed to make a scheduled bond payment. Since then, Puerto Rico has defaulted on over $1.5 billion in debt. In June 2016, Congress enacted and the President signed PROMESA in response to Puerto Rico’s fiscal crisis. PROMESA established a Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (Oversight Board), and granted it broad powers of fiscal and budgetary control over Puerto Rico. PROMESA also established a mechanism through which the Oversight Board could petition U.S. courts on Puerto Rico’s behalf to restructure debt. Under federal bankruptcy laws, Puerto Rico is otherwise prohibited from authorizing its municipalities and instrumentalities from petitioning U.S. courts to restructure debt. The Oversight Board petitioned the U.S. courts to restructure debt on behalf of Puerto Rico’s Highways and Transportation Authority and the Government Employees Retirement System on May 21, 2017 and on behalf of PREPA on July 2, 2017. In addition to its debt obligations, Puerto Rico also faces a large financial burden from its pension obligations for public employees. Puerto Rico’s public pension systems had unfunded liabilities of approximately $49 billion as of the end of fiscal year 2015, the most recent year for which data are available. Unfunded pension liabilities are similar to other kinds of debt because they constitute a promise to make a future payment or provide a benefit. Based on interviews with current and former Puerto Rico officials, federal officials, and other relevant experts, as well as a review of relevant literature, the factors that contributed to Puerto Rico’s financial condition and levels of debt related to: (1) Puerto Rico’s government running persistent deficits and (2) its use of debt to cope with deficits.",
      "The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which operates the territory’s electricity generation and distribution infrastructure, represented the largest component unit expenditure in fiscal year 2014. Figures 3 and 4 show a breakdown of expenses for Puerto Rico’s primary government and its component units, respectively. Puerto Rico’s government spending accounts for more than a third of the territory’s GDP. In fiscal year 2014—the latest year for which audited spending data were available as of March 1, 2018—primary government expenditures of $22.0 billion represented 21 percent of the territory’s GDP. Including component spending, total public expenditures were $38.7 billion, which represented 38 percent of the territory’s GDP. By comparison, our prior work has shown that in 2014, total state and local government expenditures represented about 14 percent of GDP for the United States as a whole, excluding territories. Federal government expenditures were 20 percent of GDP for the United States as a whole in 2014. Puerto Rico’s total public debt as a share of its economy has grown over time. In 2002, the value of its debt was 42 percent of the territory’s GDP, and 67 percent of its GNP. Both of these ratios grew over time such that by 2014, Puerto Rico’s total public debt was 66 percent of the territory’s GDP and 99 percent of its GNP. Figure 5 compares Puerto Rico’s total public debt to its GDP and GNP, in both aggregate and per capita. As of the end of fiscal year 2014, the last year for which Puerto Rico issued audited financial statements, Puerto Rico had $67.8 billion in net public debt outstanding, or $68.1 billion excluding accounting adjustments that are not attributed in the financial statements to specific agencies. Of the $68.1 billion, $40.6 billion was owed by Puerto Rico’s primary government, and $27.6 billion was owed by its component units, as shown in figure 6 (these amounts do not sum to $68.1 billion because of rounding). The growth of Puerto Rico’s total debt resulted in greater annual debt servicing obligations."

      "Section 1044 provides that federal law preempts such laws only if: (A) application of a State consumer financial law would have a discriminatory effect on national banks, in comparison with the effect of the law on a bank chartered by that State; (B) in accordance with the legal standard for preemption in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in [ Barnett Bank ], the State consumer financial law prevents or significantly interferes with the exercise by the national bank of its powers; and any preemption determination under this subparagraph may be made by a court, or by regulation or order of the Comptroller of the Currency on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with applicable law; or (C) the State consumer financial law is preempted by a provision of Federal law other than title 62 of the Revised Statutes. Beyond this general preemption standard, Section 1044 contains a number of other provisions narrowing the OCC's preemption authority. First, Section 1044 provides that courts reviewing OCC preemption determinations should accord those determinations only Skidmore deference, under which courts assess an agency's interpretation of a statute \"depending upon the thoroughness evident in the consideration of the agency, the validity of the reasoning of the agency, the consistency with other valid determinations made by the agency, and other factors which the court finds persuasive and relevant to its decision.\" Before the enactment of Dodd-Frank, certain courts had afforded OCC preemption determinations a more permissive form of deference known as Chevron deference, according to which courts defer to agency interpretations as long as they are reasonable. Section 1044 accordingly requires that courts take a less deferential posture toward OCC preemption determinations. Second, Section 1044 provides that no OCC preemption determination \"shall be interpreted or applied so as to invalidate, or otherwise declare inapplicable to a national bank, the provision of the State consumer financial law, unless substantial evidence, made on the record of the proceeding, supports the specific finding regarding the preemption of such provision in accordance with the legal standard\" established by Barnett Bank .",
      "Third, the report discusses the Supreme Court's decision in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson , where the Court held that federal law preempts state laws that \"significantly interfere\" with the powers of national banks. Fourth, the report reviews two Supreme Court decisions concerning the extent to which states may exercise \"visitorial powers\" over national banks. Fifth, the report discusses the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC's) preemption rules and provisions in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act concerning the preemption of state consumer protection laws. Finally, the report outlines a number of current issues in banking preemption, including (1) the extent to which non-banks can benefit from federal preemption of state usury laws, (2) the OCC's decision to grant special purpose national bank charters to financial technology (FinTech) companies, and (3) proposals to provide legal protections to banks serving marijuana businesses that comply with state law. The doctrine of federal preemption is grounded in the Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the Constitution, which provides that \"the Laws of the United States . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\" The Supreme Court has explained that \"under the Supremacy Clause . . . any state law, however clearly within a State's acknowledged power, which interferes with or is contrary to federal law, must yield.\" The Court has identified two general ways in which federal law can preempt state law. Federal law can expressly preempt state law when a federal statute or regulation contains explicit preemptive language—that is, where a clause in the relevant federal statute or regulation explicitly provides that federal law displaces certain categories of state law. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act, for example, contains a preemption clause providing that some of the Act's provisions \"shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any [regulated] employee benefit plan.\""

As mentioned earlier, the FAR provides that executive branch agencies seeking to acquire equipment should consider whether it is more economical to lease equipment rather than purchase it and identifies factors agencies should consider in this analysis, such as estimated length of the period that the equipment is to be used, the extent of use in that time period, and maintenance costs. This analysis is commonly referred to as a lease-versus-purchase analysis. While the FAR does not specifically require that agencies document their lease-versus-purchase analyses, according to federal internal control standards, management should clearly document all transactions and other significant events in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily available for examination and also communicate quality information to enable staff to complete their responsibilities. As discussed below, we found that most acquisitions we reviewed from FWS, NPS, and the Air Force did not contain any documentation of a lease-versus-purchase analysis. Specifically, officials were unable to provide documentation of a lease-versus-purchase analysis for six of the eight acquisitions we reviewed. FWS officials were able to provide documentation for the other two. Officials told us that a lease-versus- purchase analysis was not conducted for five of the six acquisitions and did not know if such analysis was conducted for the other acquisition. According to agency officials, the main reason why analyses were not conducted or documented for these six acquisitions is that the circumstances in which such analyses were to be performed or documented were not always clear to FWS, NPS, and Air Force officials.",
      "FWS spent over $32 million to purchase 348 heavy equipment assets from calendar years 2012 through 2016. FWS used its heavy equipment to maintain refuge areas throughout the United States and its territories, including maintaining roads and nature trails. FWS also used heavy equipment to respond to inclement weather and natural disasters. Most of the heavy equipment items purchased by FWS were in the construction, mining, excavating, and highway maintenance equipment category and include items such as excavators, which were used for moving soil, supplies, and other resources. FWS officials reported that they did not have any long-term leases for any heavy equipment in fiscal years 2012 through 2016 because they encourage equipment sharing and rentals to avoid long-term leases whenever possible. FWS officials provided data on 228 rentals for this time period with a total cost of over $1 million. Information regarding these rentals is contained in an Interior-wide property management system, the Financial Business Management System (FBMS). FWS officials told us that they have not rented heavy equipment through GSA’s program because they have found lower prices through local equipment rental companies. NPS spent over $27 million to purchase 471 heavy equipment assets from calendar years 2012 through 2016. NPS uses heavy equipment— located throughout the United States and its territories—to maintain national parks and respond to inclement weather and natural disasters. For example, NPS used heavy equipment such as dump trucks, snow plows, road graders, and wheel loaders to clear and salt the George Washington Memorial Parkway in Washington, D.C., following snow and ice storms. Most of the heavy equipment items purchased by NPS were in the construction, mining, excavating, and highway maintenance equipment category and include items such as excavators, which are used for moving soil, supplies, and other resources. NPS reported spending about $360,000 on 230 long-term leases and rentals in fiscal years 2012 through 2016, not including rentals through GSA’s Short-Term Rental program, which had previously been limited to passenger vehicles, in part program."

      "However, Oregon is the only state in our Nation that does not currently have a ship in the fleet named for the state, its cities or communities. Secretary Mabus named LPD 27 after Portland, Oregon, to correct that oversight and acknowledge the support and contributions made by the men and women of Portland and Oregon. As noted elsewhere in this report, on October 10, 2014, the Navy announced that it was naming the Virginia-class attack submarine SSN-793 for Oregon. A May 21, 2016, Navy blog post about the ship's christening states that \"LPD-27 will be the third Navy ship named Portland, honoring both the Oregon seaport and Maine's largest city.\" That statement is not correct, as the Navy confirms that LPD-27 is named solely for Portland, OR. A July 5, 2017, Navy News Service report states correctly that \"LPD 27 is named for the city of Portland, Oregon, and follows the World War II heavy cruiser CA 33 and the amphibious ship LSD 37 as the third U.S. Navy ship to bear the name Portland.\" LPD-27 is scheduled to be commissioned in Portland, OR, on April 21, 2018. Table 3 shows past enacted provisions going back to the 100 th Congress regarding future ship-naming decisions. All of these measures expressed the sense of the Congress (or of the Senate or House) about how a future Navy ship should be named. Table 4 shows past examples of proposed bills and amendments regarding future ship-naming decisions going back to the 93 rd Congress. Some of these measures expressed the sense of the Congress about how a Navy ship should be named, while others would mandate a certain name for a ship. Although few of these measures were acted on after being referred to committee, they all signaled congressional interest in how certain ships should be named, and thus may have influenced Navy decisions on these matters. S.Con. Res. 10 of the 115 th Congress was introduced in the Senate on March 21, 2017; no further actions for the measure are listed at Congress.gov. The text of S.Con. Res. 10 as introduced was as follows:",
      "(Los Angeles-class attack submarines were named for cities, and SSN-705 had been named for Corpus Christi, TX.) H.Con. Res. 312 was introduced on April 21, 1982, and was referred to the Seapower and Strategic and Critical Materials subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee on April 28, 1982. On May 10, 1982, the Navy modified the name of SSN-705 to City of Corpus Christi . On April 12, 2013, then-Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced that LPD-27, a San Antonio (LPD-17) class amphibious ship, would be named for Portland, OR. LPD-27 is to be the third Navy ship to bear the name Portland. The first, a cruiser (CA-33), was named for Portland, ME. It was commissioned into service in February 1933, decommissioned in July 1946, and maintained in reserve status until struck from the Navy list in March 1959. The second, an amphibious ship (LSD-37), was named for both Portland, ME, and Portland, OR. It was commissioned into service in October 1970, decommissioned in October 2003, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in March 2004. An April 18, 2013, press release from Senator Angus King stated that \"U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King today sent a letter to Ray Mabus, the Secretary of the Navy, asking that the USS Portland [LPD-27], a new San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship named after the city of Portland, Oregon, also be named in honor of Portland, Maine, consistent with the long history and tradition of U.S. Navy ships bestowed with the name USS Portland.\" In reply, the Navy sent letters dated April 24, 2013, to Senators Collins and King that stated the following in part: In addition to [the ballistic missile submarine] USS MAINE (SSBN 743), Secretary [of the Navy Ray] Mabus recently honored the state of Marine through his naming of [the expeditionary fast transport ship] USNS MILLINOCKET (JHSV 3) [now called T-EPF 3] which was christened last weekend and will proudly represent our Nation as part of the fleet for decades to come. The Secretary of the Navy has tremendous appreciation for the state of Maine, its citizens and the incredible support provided by them to our Navy and our Nation.",

While conducting anti-gunnery exercises in Pearl Harbor, BB-31 was struck by a torpedo and capsized during the initial stages of the Japanese attack [on December 7, 1941]. She was struck from the Navy record Nov. 13, 1944 and received a battle star for her service in World War I.\" The Navy's naming announcements for Virginia-class submarines have reduced the group of states for which several decades had passed since a ship named for the state had been in commissioned service with the Navy as a combat asset, and for which no ship by that name is currently under construction. This group used to include Illinois, Delaware, Vermont, Oregon, and Montana, but Virginia-class attack submarines have now been named for these states. (See the Virginia-class attack submarine naming announcements of April 13, 2012; November 19, 2012; September 18, 2014; October 10, 2014; and September 2, 2015, respectively.)

      "Amphibious assault ships (LHAs), which look like medium-sized aircraft carriers, are being named for important battles in which U.S. Marines played a prominent part, and for famous earlier U.S. Navy ships that were not named for battles. The Navy announced on June 27, 2008, that the first LHA-6 class amphibious assault ship, LHA-6, would be named America , a name previously used for an aircraft carrier (CV-66) that served in the Navy from 1965 to 1996. The Navy announced on May 4, 2012, that LHA-7, the second ship in the class, LHA-7, would be named Tripoli , the location of famous Marine battles in the First Barbary War. The Navy reaffirmed this name selection with a more formal announcement on May 30, 2014. On November 9, 2016, the Navy announced that the third ship in the class, LHA-8, will be named Bougainville , the location of a famous World War II campaign in the Pacific. San Antonio (LPD-17) class amphibious ships are being named for major U.S. cities and communities (with major being defined as being one of the top three population centers in a state), and cities and communities attacked on September 11, 2001. An exception occurred on April 23, 2010, when the Navy announced that it was naming LPD-26, the 10 th ship in the class, for the late Representative John P. Murtha. Another exception occurred on May 2, 2018, when the Navy announced that it was naming LPD-29, the 13 th ship in the class, for Navy Captain Richard M. McCool, Jr., who received the Medal of Honor for his actions in World War II and later served in the Korean and Vietnam wars. As of May 6, 2019, the Navy had not announced a name for LPD-30, which was funded in FY2018, and which is to be the first of a new version, or flight, of the LPD-17 class design called the LPD-17 Flight II design. On January 6, 2016, then-Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced that the Navy's new oilers will be named for \"people who fought for civil rights and human rights,\" and that the first ship in the class, TAO-205, which was procured in FY2016, will be named for Representative John Lewis.",
      "The 26 state-named Virginia-class boats procured through FY2018, together with the additional Virginia-class boats planned for procurement in FY2020 and subsequent years and the 17 existing state-named Ohio (SSBN-726) class SSBNs and cruise missile submarine (SSGNs), could make for a total of more than 50 boats starting around FY2022. Thus, starting around FY2022, the Navy might run out of state names for Virginia-class boats, and consequently might need to either amend the Virginia-class naming rule or begin making a series of exceptions to the rule. The July 2012 Navy report to Congress states that \"while carrier names are still 'individually considered,' they are now generally named in honor of past US Presidents.\" Of the 14 most recently named aircraft carriers (those with hull numbers 67 through 80), 10 have been named for U.S. Presidents and 2 for Members of Congress. The Navy is currently procuring Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class carriers. On January 16, 2007, the Navy announced that CVN-78, the lead ship in the CVN-78 class, would be named for President Gerald R. Ford. On May 29, 2011, the Navy announced that CVN-79, the second ship in the class, would be named for President John F. Kennedy. On December 1, 2012, the Navy announced that CVN-80, the third ship in the class, would be named Enterprise . The Navy made the announcement on the same day that it deactivated the 51-year-old aircraft carrier CVN-65, also named Enterprise . CVN-80 is the ninth Navy ship named Enterprise . CVN-80 was procured in the FY2018 budget, which Congress considered in 2017. If CVN-80, like most Navy ships, had been named at about the time of procurement, or later, rather than in 2012, it would have been named by the current Secretary of the Navy, Richard Spencer. The July 2012 Navy report to Congress, which was produced when Ray Mabus was the Secretary of the Navy, states that Secretary [of the Navy Ray] Mabus values the ability to consider [aircraft] carrier names on an individual, case‐by‐case basis, for two reasons."

      "China's domestic laws include such provisions, while those of the United States do not. Those rules would allow China to justify its seemingly contradictory approach to AGI operations—or, as Kardon put it, \"to have their cake and eat it too.\" Therefore, under the Chinese interpretation of UNCLOS, its actions are neither hypocritical nor illegal—yet do not justify similar surveillance against China. Here, noted legal scholar Jerome Cohen emphasizes, the U.S. position remains the globally dominant view—\"since most nations believe the coastal state has no right to forbid surveillance in its EEZ, they do not have domestic laws that do so.\" This renders China's attempted constraints legally problematic, since \"international law is based on reciprocity.\" To explain his interpretation of Beijing's likely approach, Cohen invokes the observation that a French commentator made several decades ago in the context of discussing China's international law policy regarding domestic legal issues: \"I demand freedom from you in the name of your principles. I deny it to you in the name of mine.\" Based on his personal experience interacting with Chinese officials and legal experts, Kardon adds, \"China is increasingly confident that its interpretation of some key rules and—most critically—its practices reinforcing that interpretation can over time shape the Law of the Sea regime to suit its preferences.\" But China is not putting all its eggs in that basket. There are increasing indications that it is attempting to promote its EEZ approach vis-à-vis the U.S. not legally but politically. \"Beijing is shifting from rules- to relations-based objections,\" Naval War College China Maritime Studies Institute Director Peter Dutton observes. \"In this context, its surveillance operations in undisputed U.S. EEZs portend an important shift, but that does not mean that China will be more flexible in the East or South China Seas.\" The quasi-authoritative Chinese commentary that has emerged thus far supports this interpretation....",
      "[A recent statement from a Chinese official] suggests that Beijing will increasingly oppose U.S. SROs on the grounds that they are incompatible with the stable, cooperative Sino-American relationship that Beijing and Washington have committed to cultivating. The Obama Administration must ensure that the \"new-type Navy-to-Navy relations\" that Chinese Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Wu Shengli has advocated to his U.S. counterpart does not contain expectations that U.S. SROs will be reduced in nature, scope, or frequency.... China's conducting military activities in a foreign EEZ implies that, under its interpretation, some such operations are indeed legal. It therefore falls to China now to clarify its stance—to explain why its operations are consistent with international law, and what sets them apart from apparently similar American activities. If China does not explain away the apparent contradiction in a convincing fashion, it risks stirring up increased international resentment—and undermining its relationship with the U.S. Beijing is currently engaging in activities very much like those it has vociferously opposed. That suggests the promotion of a double standard untenable in the international system, and very much at odds with the relationships based on reciprocity, respect, and cooperation that China purports to promote.... If, however, China chooses to remain silent, it will likely have to accept—at least tacitly, without harassing—U.S. surveillance missions in its claimed EEZ. So, as we watch for clarification on Beijing's legal interpretation, it will also be important to watch for indications regarding the next SROs in China's EEZ. In September 2014, a Chinese surveillance ship operated in U.S. EEZ waters near Guam as it observed a joint-service U.S. military exercise called Valiant Shield. A U.S. spokesperson for the exercise stated the following: \"We'd like to reinforce that military operations in international commons and outside of territorial waters and airspace is a fundamental right that all nations have...."

      "SSA’s mission is to deliver Social Security services that meet the changing needs of the public. The Social Security Act and amendments established three programs that the agency administers: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance provides monthly retirement and survivors benefits to retired and disabled workers, their spouses and their children, and the survivors of insured workers who have died. SSA has estimated that, in fiscal year 2019, $892 billion in old-age and survivors insurance benefits are expected to be paid to a monthly average of approximately 54 million beneficiaries. Disability Insurance provides monthly benefits to disabled workers and their spouses and children. The agency estimates that, in fiscal year 2019, a total of approximately $149 billion in disability insurance benefits will be paid to a monthly average of about 10 million eligible workers. Supplemental Security Income is a needs-based program financed from general tax revenues that provides benefits to aged adults, blind or disabled adults, and children with limited income and resources. For fiscal year 2019, SSA estimates that nearly $59 billion in federal benefits and state supplementary payments will be made to a monthly average of approximately 8 million recipients. SSA relies heavily on its IT resources to support the administration of its programs and related activities. For example, its systems are used to handle millions of transactions on the agency’s website, maintain records for the millions of beneficiaries and recipients of its programs, and evaluate evidence and make determinations of eligibility for benefits. According to the agency’s most recent Information Resources Strategic Plan, its systems supported the processing of an average daily volume of about 185 million individual transactions in fiscal year 2015. SSA’s Office of the Deputy Commissioner for Systems is responsible for developing, overseeing, and maintaining the agency’s IT systems. Comprised of approximately 3,800 staff, the office is headed by the Deputy Commissioner, who also serves as the agency’s CIO.",
      "The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), an independent federal agency, administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness insurance for railroad workers and their families under the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA). These acts cover workers who are employed by railroads engaged in interstate commerce and related subsidiaries, railroad associations, and railroad labor organizations. Lifelong railroad workers receive railroad retirement benefits instead of Social Security benefits; railroad workers with nonrailroad experience receive benefits either from railroad retirement or Social Security, depending on the length of their railroad service. The number of railroad workers has been declining since the 1950s, although the rate of decline has been irregular and recent years have seen increases in railroad employment after reaching an all-time low of 215,000 workers in January 2010. Recently, railroad employment peaked in April 2015 to 253,000 workers, the highest level since November 1999, and then declined through FY2017, falling to 221,000 workers. The total number of beneficiaries under the RRA and RUIA decreased from 623,000 in FY2008 to 574,000 in FY2017, and total benefit payments increased from $10.1 billion to $12.6 billion during the same time. During FY2017, the RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries. Almost $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits were paid to approximately 28,000 claimants. This report explains the programs under RRA and RUIA, including how each program is financed, the eligibility rules, and the types of benefits available to railroad workers and family members. It also discusses how railroad retirement relates to the Social Security system. For a quick overview of this topic, see CRS In Focus IF10481, Railroad Retirement Board: Retirement, Survivor, Disability, Unemployment, and Sickness Benefits .",
      "The RRA authorizes retirement, survivor, and disability benefits for railroad workers and their families. In December 2017, there were a total of 526,100 RRA beneficiaries, decreasing from 672,400 in 2001. This decline might partly result from the decline in railroad employment in the past five decades. The average monthly benefit for each beneficiary was about $1,986 in 2017, which increased from $1,043 in 2001, reflecting the growth in average wages and prices (see Figure 1 ). The railroad retirement, disability, and survivor program is mainly financed by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT) (see Figure 2 ), all of which accounted for 93.9% of the $12.7 billion gross funding of the RRA program during FY2017. The remaining 6.1% of the program was financed by federal income taxes levied on railroad retirement benefits, interest on investment and other revenue, and general appropriations to pay the costs of phasing out vested dual benefits. Payroll taxes, which provided 47.0% of gross RRA funding in FY2017, are the largest funding source for railroad retirement, survivor, and disability benefits. Railroad retirement payroll taxes are divided into two tiers—Tier I and Tier II taxes. The Tier I tax is the same as the Social Security payroll tax: railroad employers and employees each pay 6.2% on earnings up to $132,900 in 2019. The Tier II tax is set each year based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs. In 2019, the Tier II tax is 13.1% for employers and 4.9% for employees on earnings up to $98,700. Tier II taxes are used to finance Tier II benefits, the portion of Tier I benefits in excess of Social Security retirement benefits (such as unreduced early retirement benefits for railroad employees with at least 30 years of railroad service), and supplemental annuities. Tier I payroll taxes are deposited in the Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account (SSEBA), which pays the Social Security level of benefits and administrative expenses allocable to those benefits.",
      "T he Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) program provides cash benefits to federal, state, and local law enforcement officers; firefighters; employees of emergency management agencies; and members of emergency medical services agencies who are killed or permanently and totally disabled as the result of personal injuries sustained in the line of duty. The Public Safety Officers' Educational Assistance (PSOEA) program, a component of the PSOB program, provides higher-education assistance to the children and spouses of public safety officers killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty. Both programs are administered by the PSOB Office of the Department of Justice (DOJ), Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). Congress appropriates funds for these programs in the annual Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. For FY2019, the one-time lump-sum PSOB benefit is $359,316 and the monthly full-time attendance PSOEA assistance is $1,224. The PSOB and PSOEA benefit amounts are indexed to reflect changes in the cost of living. Table 1 shows PSOB and PSOEA claims and approvals as reported by DOJ. To be eligible for PSOB benefits for death or disability, a person must have served in one of the following categories of public safety officers: law enforcement officer, firefighter, or chaplain in a public agency; FEMA employee or a state, local, or tribal emergency management agency employee; or emergency medical services member.

      "FIPSE is a grant program that seeks to support the implementation of innovative educational reform ideas and evaluate how well they work. As specified in the law, the projects can provide housing to the youth when housing at an educational institution is closed or unavailable to other students. FY2019 appropriations for FIPSE are $5 million. Recently emancipated foster youth are vulnerable to becoming homeless. In FY2017, nearly 20,000 youth \"aged out\" of foster care. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP), created under the Chafee Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 ( P.L. 106-169 ), provides states with funding to support children and youth ages 14 to 21 who are in foster care and former foster youth ages 18 to 21 (and up to age 23 in states that extend foster care to age 21). States are authorized to receive funds based on their share of the total number of children in foster care nationwide. However, the law's \"hold harmless\" clause precludes any state from receiving less than the amount of funds it received in FY1998 or $500,000, whichever is greater. The program specifies funding for transitional living services, and as much as 30% of the funds may be dedicated to room and board. The program is funded through mandatory spending, and as such $140 million ($143 million as of FY2020) is provided for the program each year through the annual appropriations process. The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA), Title III of the Child Abuse Amendments of 1984 ( P.L. 98-457 ), authorized funds for Family Violence Prevention and Service grants that work to prevent family violence, improve service delivery to address family violence, and increase knowledge and understanding of family violence. From FY2007 to FY2009, one of these projects focused on runaway and homeless youth in dating violence situations through HHS's Domestic Violence/Runaway and Homeless Youth Collaboration on the Prevention of Adolescent Dating Violence initiative. The initiative was created because many runaway and homeless youth come from homes where domestic violence occurs and may be at risk of abusing their partners or becoming victims of abuse."

      "D) To increase the number of firms eligible for federal procurement contracts by reducing the size standards"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A)",
    "documentation": [
      "Under the SBA's proposal, 98.6% of all firms with employees would be classified as small. The final rule was published in the Federal Register on February 9, 1984. Representative Parren J. Mitchell, chair of the House Committee on Small Business, expressed disappointment in the SBA's final rule, stating at a congressional oversight hearing on July 30, 1985, that \"the government and the business community are still victimized by that same ad hoc, sporadic system that the SBA promised to fix some six years ago.\" He introduced legislation ( H.R. 1178 , a bill to amend the Small Business Act) that would have required the SBA to adjust its size standard for an industrial classification downward by at least 20% if small business' share of that market equaled or exceeded 60%, and at least 40% of the market share was achieved through the receipt of federal procurement contracts. The bill also mandated a minimum 10% increase in the SBA's size standard for an industrial classification if small business' share of that market was less than 20% and less than 10% of the market share was achieved through the receipt of federal procurement contracts. The bill was opposed by various trade associations, the SBA, and federal agency procurement officials, and was not reported out of committee. On December 31, 1992, the SBA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking \"to streamline its size standards\" by reducing the number of fixed size standard levels from 30 to 9. The nine proposed size standards were no more than 100, 500, 750, 1,000, or 1,500 employees; and no more than $5 million, $10 million, $18 million, or $24 million in annual receipts. The annual receipts levels reflected an upward adjustment of 43% for inflation. The SBA argued that the proposed changes would make the size standards more user-friendly for small business owners and restore eligibility to nearly 20,000 firms that were no longer considered small solely because of the effects of inflation. The proposed rule was later withdrawn as a courtesy to allow the incoming Clinton Administration time to review it.",
      "Jules Abels, SBA's economic advisor to the Administrator, explained at that congressional hearing how the SBA's staff determined what constituted a small business: There are various techniques for the demarcation lines, but in a study of almost any industry, you will find a large cluster of small concerns around a certain figure.... On the other hand, above a certain dividing line you will find relatively few and as you map out a picture of an industry it appears that a dividing line at a certain point is fair. On January 5, 1956, the SBA published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register announcing its first proposed small business size standards. During the public comment period, representatives of several industries argued that the proposed standards were too restrictive and excluded too many firms. In response, Mr. Abels testified that the SBA decided to adjust its figures to make them \"a little bit more liberal because there was some feeling on the part of certain industries that they were too tight and that they excluded too many firms.\" The SBA published its final rule concerning its small business size standards on December 7, 1956, and they became effective on January 1, 1957. The SBA decided to use number of employees as the sole criterion for determining if manufacturing firms were small and annual sales or annual receipts as the sole criterion for all other industries. Mr. Abels explained at the congressional hearing the SBA's rationale for using number of employees for classifying manufacturing firms as small and annual sales or annual receipts for all other firms: in the absence of automation which would give one firm in an industry a great advantage over another, roughly speaking if the firms were mechanized to the same extent, a firm with 400 employees would have an output which would be twice as large as the output of a firm with 200 employees.... However when you depart from the manufacturing field and go into, say, a distributive field or trade, it then becomes necessary to discard the number of employees, because it is a matter of judicial notice, that one man for example in the distributive trades can sell as much as 100 men can sell.",
      "It prohibited \"the SBA from promulgating any final rule or regulation relating to small business size standards until March 31, 1981.\" In the meantime, the Reagan Administration entered office, and, as is customary when there is a change in Administration, replaced the SBA's senior leadership. The SBA's new Administrator, Michael Cardenas, was sympathetic to the concerns of federal agencies that the proposed size standards in the services and construction industries were set too low to meet those agencies' procurement needs. As a result, he indicated that the SBA would modify its size standards proposal by (1) increasing the proposed size standards for 51 industries, mostly in the services and construction industries; (2) lowering the proposed size standards in 157 manufacturing industries (typically from no more than 2,500 employees to no more than 500 employees) to prevent one or more of the largest producers in those industries from being classified as small; and (3) increasing the SBA's proposed lowest size standard from no more than 15 employees to no more than 25 employees (affecting 93 service and trade industries). The net effect of these changes would have restored eligibility for approximately 60,000 of the 225,000 firms expected to lose eligibility under the previous Administration's proposal. The SBA subsequently met with various trade organizations and federal agency procurement officials to discuss the proposal. As these consultations took place, the SBA experienced another turnover in its senior leadership. The SBA, headed by the new appointee, James C. Sanders, issued a notice of proposed rulemaking concerning its size standards on May 3, 1982. The proposal differed from its March 10, 1980, predecessor in three ways: First, the range of size standards was narrowed to a range of 25 employees to 500 employees. This reflected a widespread view that 15 employees was too low a cutoff while 2,500 employees was too high. Second, SBA proposed a 500-employee ceiling, focusing on smaller firms."

    "question": "A post office manager is tasked with investigating a customer complaint about a lost package. The manager has access to several reports, including Report 1, which identifies competitive products that do not have all the required scans, and Report 3, which monitors scanning status and performances for each competitive product that has received an arrival scan but lacks a delivery scan. However, the manager is unsure how to use these reports to investigate the issue, and some managers have been manually entering scanning or service-performance information retroactively to improve their performance scores.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A)",
    "documentation": [
      "For example, the postmaster monitors performance of employees at the post office and is accountable to the district manager. In turn, each district manager is held accountable by the area vice president. To monitor performance of scanning of competitive products, these managers have access to several USPS data systems to generate reports. They can use the reports to monitor scanning performance of carriers and clerks at each post office and to identify the causes of scanning issues, such as missing or incorrect scans. Managers can also use these reports to track the status of competitive products or to investigate customer complaints of lost items. Some examples of reports available to managers include the following: Report 1: USPS officials told us that each post office receives this report from their District Office. The report identifies competitive products that do not have all the required scans, such as scans when the item arrives at the post office or when a delivery attempt was made. For example, one district official sends postmasters weekly reports on competitive products that do not have all the required scans. The officials told us that these reports help managers investigate the cause of incorrect scans identified in the report and how to prevent future occurrences. Report 2: USPS officials told us that this report is generated by district managers to proactively identify scanning irregularities, such as scans that may be out of sequence or multiple competitive products that are scanned at the same time but are for different addresses. District management can query postmasters about these scans and ask them to investigate the reason for the irregularities and determine if the scan was appropriate. Report 3: USPS officials told us that this report is generated by postmasters to monitor scanning status and performances for each competitive product that has received an arrival scan but lacks a delivery scan. While this may indicate a problem, it could also just reflect that the final scan had not been made by the end of the day or the scan that had not been uploaded into the USPS data systems when the report was generated.",
      "Introduce new procedures: USPS officials told us that post office managers use stand-up talks to introduce new procedures and processes with carriers and clerks. For example, postmasters stated that they used these meetings to introduce and train carriers on new scanning features at the post offices. USPS district and area management develop and disseminate memos and handouts to assist managers conducting these meetings. We reviewed handouts USPS provided to managers for service talks. These handouts provided information on the rollout of some of the most recent scanning procedure changes. Continuously improve operations: District managers we interviewed stated that post offices with low scanning performance scores are placed on a district’s list of underperforming post offices. USPS district managers we interviewed told us that they meet with these post offices to determine how each post office plans to improve its scanning performance. District management also conducts audits of underperforming post offices and post offices that are in need of improvement. Our review of one district office’s service review checklist identified the key areas of audit for underperforming post offices. Reassess procedures: Representatives of mailers we interviewed told us that they meet with USPS representatives to discuss ways USPS can share scanning information for competitive products. Given that inaccurate scans can and do occur, it is important that postal managers explore and investigate any instances of missed or inaccurate scans. To do so, USPS managers—including area vice presidents, district managers, and postmasters—use a variety of reports as tools to ensure that the required scans are made at the appropriate place and time, and take action to monitor the status of competitive products, track lost items, and identify scanning issues. USPS headquarters designs reports used by managers to review performance at the local level across the country. Managers at each level are responsible for overseeing and reporting on the performances of the level below them.",
      "While having these reports are helpful, their full potential to help USPS managers may be limited because USPS lacks detailed and up-to-date standard operating procedures for how managers should use these reports or conduct other activities to efficiently investigate and resolve scanning issues. USPS’s Scanning Performance: Delivery Standard Operating Procedures for managers are a list of bullet points outlining managers’ responsibilities to meet scanning performance target goals and not a list of detailed procedures for managers to follow, such as how to use Report 1 to identify items that do not have all the required scans. In addition, USPS officials told us that this list has not been updated since approximately October 2005. The COSO Framework states that organizations should internally communicate information, including objectives and responsibilities for internal control, necessary to support the functioning of internal control. Further, it states that a process should be in place to communicate required information to enable all personnel to understand and carry out their internal-control responsibilities. Absent such communication, managers may take different actions to address problems or may have difficulty knowing where to find the appropriate information to locate a missing item to resolve a customer’s complaint quickly. For example, one post office manager told us that he will look at the scanning history in the USPS data systems to determine if the item received an acceptable delivery event scan or what the status of the item is on the route, while another post office manager told us he will use GPS data to see where the scans were made to determine if the item was delivered to the right address. If managers do not know where to find the appropriate information, they may spend more time investigating and be less efficient in resolving issues. Further, not having detailed standard operating procedures means managers may not be aware of all the reports available to them.",
      "For example, some post office managers told us that they use Report 3 while other post office managers told us that this report was not available to them. Without using Report 3, some managers told us that they look in several sources to find the same information needed to resolve the issue, such as locating a lost package. Some managers told us that USPS management discontinued the report because it was being misused by some managers. Specifically, managers told us that some managers were manually entering scanning or service-performance information retroactively to improve their performance scores. However, they told us that USPS management recently made Report 3 available to managers again but changed features to reduce any misuse. Additionally, USPS may miss opportunities to prevent scanning issues from happening again by not clearly communicating how managers should use the various reports to address specific scanning issues. For example, the USPS OIG recently determined that instances of missed and inaccurate scans for competitive products were a result of USPS management not adequately monitoring the implementation of those procedures. Without detailed procedures to guide managers in finding and using specific information in available reports and other tools, managers will not have consistent information to use to investigate and resolve customer complaints quickly or accurately. In addition, new managers may not know where to go for the most appropriate information and how to use this information to address some issues. As competitive products have become essential to USPS’s economic viability, it is increasingly important for USPS to accurately track them to remain competitive in this market. While USPS may be scanning most mail accurately, there continue to be instances where mail is not scanned accurately or is missing scans. Given the volume and growth in these competitive products, even a small percentage of inaccurately scanned products could be a large number of such products."

Representative Ro Khanna introduced a concurrent resolution ( H.Con.

After a Houthi-fired missile with alleged Iranian origins landed deep inside Saudi Arabia in November 2017, the coalition instituted a full blockade of all of Yemen's ports, including the main port of Hudaydah, exacerbating the country's humanitarian crisis.

In parallel testimony before Congress, U.S. defense officials stated that while the United States refueled Saudi aircraft and provided advice on targeting techniques, CENTCOM did not track coalition aircraft after they were refueled and did not provide advice on specific targets. Then-Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Robert S. Karem testified that \"It's correct that we do not monitor and track all of the Saudi aircraft aloft over Yemen.\" During the same hearing, U.S. officials acknowledged that pressure from Congress has altered how the Administration deals with the coalition over the Yemen conflict. Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Satterfield told Senator Todd Young and the SFRC the following: Senator, your efforts, the efforts of your colleagues in this body and on this Committee have been exceedingly helpful in allowing the Administration to send a message from whole of government regarding the very specific concerns we have over any limitations, restrictions, constraints on the ability of both humanitarian and commercial goods specifically to include fuel to have unrestricted and expeditious entry into Yemen. And that messaging which comes from us, the Executive Branch, also comes from this body is extremely important."

      "Since January 2017, the Navy has suffered four significant mishaps at sea that have resulted in serious damage to Navy ships and the loss of 17 sailors (see figure 1). Three of the four at sea mishaps that have occurred—two collisions and one grounding—have involved ships homeported overseas in Yokosuka, Japan. Appendix II provides a summary of major mishaps for Navy ships at sea in fiscal years 2009 through 2017. The Navy currently has 277 ships, a 17 percent reduction from the 333 ships it had in 1998. Over the past two decades, as the number of Navy ships has decreased, the number of ships deployed overseas has remained roughly constant at about 100 ships; consequently, each ship is being deployed more to maintain the same level of presence. We reported in September 2016 that the Navy, along with the other military services, had been reporting persistently low readiness levels. The Navy attributes these, in part, to the increased deployment lengths needed to meet the continuing high demand for its aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, and amphibious ships. For example, the deployment lengths for carrier strike groups had increased from an average of 6.4 months during the period of 2008 through 2011 to a less sustainable 9 months for three carrier strike groups that were deployed in 2015. In 2016, the Navy extended the deployments of the Harry S Truman and Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Groups to 8 and 8.5 months, respectively. In addition, the Navy has had to shorten, eliminate, or defer training and maintenance periods to support these high deployment rates. These decisions have resulted in declining ship conditions across the fleet and have increased the amount of time required for the shipyards to complete maintenance on these ships. Lengthened maintenance periods, in turn, compress the time that ships are available for training and operations. As we previously reported, to help meet the operational demands using its existing inventory of ships, the Navy has assigned more of its surface combatants and amphibious ships to overseas homeports.",
      "We testified before the Senate Committee on Armed Services in September 2017 after four significant mishaps at sea resulted in the loss of 17 sailors’ lives and serious damage to Navy ships. We reported on some of the Navy’s challenges, including the degraded condition and expired training certifications of ships homeported overseas, reductions to ship crews that contributed to sailor overwork and safety risks, and an inability to complete maintenance on time. Since that time, the Navy has completed two internal reviews to address these and other challenges, identifying 111 recommendations to improve surface fleet readiness. The Navy formed an executive group to guide and closely track the implementation of recommendations, and its reform efforts are ongoing. As of November 2018, the Navy reported that it had implemented 78 (i.e., 70 percent) of these recommendations. Navy officials recognize that full implementation will take significant time and management attention to address the fundamental readiness challenges identified. In figure 1, we show photographs of two of the four Navy ships involved in significant mishaps that occurred in 2017. Both the USS Fitzgerald and the USS John S. McCain were involved in collisions that resulted in sailor fatalities. DOD has reported that more than a decade of conflict, budget uncertainty, and reductions in force structure have degraded its readiness; in response, the department has made rebuilding readiness a priority. The 2018 National Defense Strategy emphasizes that restoring and retaining readiness across the entire spectrum of conflict is critical to success in the emerging security environment. Nevertheless, DOD reported that readiness of the total military force remains low and has remained so since 2013. Our work has shown that the Navy has experienced increasing maintenance challenges as a high pace of operations has continued and maintenance has been deferred. Maintenance and personnel challenges also hinder readiness recovery of Navy aircraft.",
      "According to the Navy, the SUBSAFE certification status of a submarine is fundamental to its mission capability, as it provides a thorough and systematic approach to quality, and to a culture that permeates the entire submarine community. According to Navy officials, since the SUBSAFE program was established in 1963, no SUBSAFE-certified submarine has ever been lost. The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures. Our analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and the end of fiscal year 2018, attack submarines will have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. Our analysis found that the primary driver affecting attack submarines are delays in completing depot maintenance. For example, of the 10,363 total days of lost time since fiscal year 2008, 8,472 (82 percent) were due to depot maintenance delays. As we previously reported, completing ship and submarine maintenance on time is essential to Navy readiness, as maintenance periods lasting longer than planned could reduce the number of days during which ships and crews are available for training or operations. Attack submarines also face delays in beginning maintenance when the public shipyards have no available capacity, in some cases forcing submarines to idle pierside because they are no longer certified to conduct normal operations. According to Navy officials, the SUBSAFE program—its program to ensure and certify submarine safety—requires submarines to adhere to strict maintenance schedules and pass materiel condition assessments before they are allowed to submerge. Attack submarines that go too long without receiving required maintenance are at risk of having their materiel certification expire. Should this certification expire, these submarines are restricted to sitting idle, pierside, while they wait until a shipyard has the capacity to begin their maintenance period (see fig. 2)."

    "question": "The Department of Defense's use of Other Transaction Agreements (OTAs) has been a topic of debate among analysts and industry officials. According to a 2017 report to Congress, in FY2016, DOD obligated $1 billion for prototype agreements and received $68 million in cost-share contributions. However, a CRS review found concerns with the data underlying the report, and with DOD's analytical conclusions. Some argue that OTs are exempt from the Competition in Contracting Act, allowing DOD to avoid competitions, while others claim that the cost-sharing provision for prototype projects creates an unfair playing field biased against traditional defense contractors.

      "These observers also argue that traditional contractors are awarded the majority of dollars obligated to OTs, proving how difficult it is for nontraditional suppliers to break into the defense marketplace. Additionally, traditional contractors could avoid the cost-sharing requirement by teaming with a nontraditional contractor. DOD has not effectively tracked data on cost sharing. A 2017 report to Congress indicated that in FY2016 DOD obligated $1 billion for prototype agreements and received $68 million in cost-share contributions. A CRS review found numerous concerns with the data underlying the report, and with DOD's analytical conclusions. See Appendix C for further discussion. A number of analysts and industry officials have raised concerns that DOD could use OTs to avoid competitions, as OTs are exempt from the Competition in Contracting Act. According to statute, follow-on production using other transaction authority can only be awarded if the underlying R&D agreement was competed. In addition, 10 U.S.C. 2371b states that \"to the maximum extent practicable\" OTs must be competed. Determining whether OTs are being used to circumvent competition requires a two-step analysis: 1. Are OTs competed less often that traditional contracts? 2. Is there a benefit to these OTs being competed? Available FPDS-NG data suggest that DOD is broadly complying with 10 U.S.C. 2371b's competition mandate. Between FY2013 and FY2017, approximately 89% of all new OT prototype agreements were competed in some fashion. Many observers and analysts believe that OT agreements can be executed substantially faster, sometimes in a matter of weeks, compared to the months or years it typically takes to execute traditional contracts. Based in part on this belief, some officials and analysts are touting OTs as a new model for conducting acquisitions and the answer to many of the problems in defense acquisition. These analysts argue that in a world of increasingly fast technology development, DOD acquisitions must go faster or risk being left behind.",
      "In the 1990s, some DARPA OTs required participants to share costs because the types of work completed generally involved R&D that was mutually beneficial to government needs and industry commercial goals. In certain instances, present-day OTs have cost-sharing requirements that foster collaborative research. Some analysts believe that DOD is not always realizing all the benefits that OTs have to offer, such as sufficiently leveraging private capital or forming true consortia of multiple parties pooling resources. Some of these analysts believe that DOD does not sufficiently use consortia to leverage private investment through the pursuit of collaborative, mutually beneficial, dual-use technologies. Some observers argue that as the legislation on OTs has evolved, the cost-sharing provision for prototype projects has come to create an unfair playing field biased against traditional defense contractors. For prototype projects, traditional contractors generally are required to assume one-third of costs whereas nontraditional defense contractors and small businesses generally do not have to cost share. From a fairness perspective, these observers argue that traditional contractors should not have a mandatory cost share. These observers also point out that some nontraditional defense contractors are companies with billions of dollars of revenue that should not be granted a competitive cost advantage. Putting traditional defense contractors at a competitive disadvantage could deny DOD access to those companies with the most experience working on defense products, potentially depriving the military of access to leading defense-related research and technology. Other observers argue that the cost share as currently structured is appropriate: traditional defense contractors hold a significant competitive edge in their understanding of, and have the systems in place to manage, traditional contracts. In contrast, nontraditional and small businesses, which generally cannot compete with the traditional defense contractors, need the exemption from the cost-share requirement to be able to work with DOD."

CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION (CBP) The TACCOM program is intended to upgrade land mobile radio infrastructure and equipment to support approximately 95,000 users at CBP and other federal agencies. It is replacing obsolete radio systems with modern digital systems across various sectors located in 19 different service areas, linking these service areas to one another through a nationwide network, and building new communications towers to expand coverage in 5 of the 19 service areas. Issues related to security requirements have delayed full operational capability by more than a year. Program is being re-organized under Border Patrol, but still faces staffing challenges. GAO last reported on this program in April 2017 (GAO-17-346SP). In November 2017, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership re-baselined the TACCOM program, removing it from breach status after the program experienced a schedule slip and cost growth. In July 2017, CBP officials notified DHS leadership that the program would not achieve full operational capability (FOC) as planned due to issues related to federal information security requirements. The program now plans to achieve FOC by March 2019—more than a year later than its initial acquisition program baseline (APB) deadline. According to CBP officials, FOC will include planned upgrades to the San Diego system, which requires transitioning management of the legacy system from the Department of Justice to DHS. In August 2017, CBP officials stated that both agencies were reviewing an agreement with plans to complete the transition in fiscal year 2018. CBP officials stated that the program realized it would exceed its initial APB cost thresholds as it was developing its annual life-cycle cost estimate (LCCE) update and subsequently submitted a revised LCCE for DHS leadership approval. The program’s costs primarily grew because of increases in costs for contractor labor and support for facilities and infrastructure.",

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) executes a separate TECS Modernization program. Conducted additional testing of a revised key performance parameter and cybersecurity. Program has improved integration with external systems. GAO last reported on this program in April 2017 (GAO-17-346SP). In November 2017, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership approved a revised life-cycle cost estimate (LCCE) and acquisition program baseline (APB) in preparation for the program’s acquisition decision event (ADE) 3 following deployment of final functionality. According to ICE officials, the program completed deployment of full operational capability (FOC) functionality in August 2017—4 months earlier than initially planned. FOC functionality included enhancements to case management capabilities, such as improved system search capabilities. The functionality was deployed in conjunction with enhancements and fixes for initial operational capability (IOC) functionality. The program achieved IOC in June 2016, which entailed delivering 80 percent of the modernized TECS functionality and successfully transitioning ICE off the legacy system. The overall cost thresholds in the current APB increased compared to the program’s prior APB from July 2016. Specifically, the acquisition cost threshold decreased by $14 million and the operations and maintenance (O&M) cost threshold increased by $147 million. These costs changed for various reasons, such as the following: The acquisition cost threshold decreased when ICE included actual costs through fiscal year 2016 and accounted for funding shortfalls. ICE officials told GAO that the program experienced a funding shortfall in fiscal year 2017 that led it to adjust spending under multiple contracts and shift some costs to fiscal year 2018. The O&M cost threshold increased when ICE extended the estimate from fiscal years 2024 to 2028 and continued contractor and systems engineering support for an additional 11 years.",

CBP plans to create a border enforcement zone between a primary barrier—such as a fence—and a secondary barrier. To establish the enforcement zone, the wall system may also include detection technology, surveillance cameras, lighting, and roads for maintenance and patrolling. CBP has evaluated prototypes for new barrier designs, but risks with planned detection technologies exist. CBP is leveraging staff and the contracting strategy from prior border fencing programs. GAO last reported on the existing Southwest border barriers in February 2017 (GAO-17-331). In April 2017, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership granted CBP permission to procure barrier prototypes to inform new design standards and approved the construction of the first segment of the wall system. CBP subsequently awarded 8 task orders with a total value of over $3 million for the development of prototypes and selected San Diego as the first segment. CBP plans to replace an existing 14 miles of primary and secondary barriers in San Diego. DHS plans to use fiscal year 2017 funding for the replacement of the primary barrier, which it plans to rebuild to existing design standards. DHS has requested funding for replacement of the secondary barrier beginning in fiscal year 2018 that it plans to rebuild to new design standards once established.",

This is more than a 2-year delay from CBP’s initial FOC date and a 9-month delay from its most recent revised FOC date. DHS approved the fourth version of the program’s acquisition program baseline (APB) in July 2016. In this APB, CBP split FOC into two separate operational capability milestones at its data centers to better reflect the program’s activities.",
      "Recent testing shows progress, but additional operational testing delayed to May 2018. GAO last reported on this program in April 2017 (GAO-17-346SP). In November 2017, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership approved a revised acquisition program baseline (APB) after the LSCMS program experienced a schedule breach. In September 2017, FEMA officials notified DHS leadership that it would not complete all required activities—including follow-on operational test and evaluation (OT&E)—to achieve acquisition decision event (ADE) 3 and full operational capability (FOC) by its initial APB dates of September 2018 and December 2018, respectively. According to FEMA officials, the delay was primarily caused by the need to deploy LSCMS program personnel in support of response and recovery efforts during the 2017 hurricane season. The program now plans to achieve FOC by June 2019—up to 6 months later than initially planned. DHS leadership authorized LSCMS to resume all development and acquisition efforts in March 2016 after a nearly 2-year program pause following program management issues. In October 2017, FEMA officials told GAO that they had completed several development efforts—such as integration with DHS’s asset management system—and were in the process of adding Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) to allow LSCMS to interface with its partners’ information systems. The program’s annual life-cycle cost estimate (LCCE) update continued to be within its APB cost thresholds. However, the program’s APB thresholds are not adjusted to account for risk, which increases the chance that the program could experience a cost breach. As of November 2017, FEMA officials did not anticipate that its schedule delays would lead to a cost breach. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) LOGISTICS SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (LSCMS) The LSCMS program previously experienced significant execution challenges because of poor governance.

While these recommendations had already recognized the need for the Lead Office to collaborate with PIH, we reworded them to clarify that it is not necessary for the Lead Office to have primary responsibility for their implementation. HUD generally agreed with our seventh and eighth recommendations, but noted some considerations for implementing them. For our seventh recommendation about performance goals and measures, HUD noted that it will re-examine the availability of information from the current housing databases to determine whether data on housing unit production can be added to the existing data collected. HUD noted if that information is not sufficient, it would need to obtain Office of Management and Budget approval and have sufficient funds for such an information technology project. For our eighth recommendation about evaluating the Lead Safe Housing and Lead Disclosure Rules, HUD noted if its own resources are insufficient, the time frame for implementing this recommendation may depend on the availability of funding for contracted resources. Finally, in response to our ninth recommendation, HUD said that it will draft and submit annual and biennial reports to the congressional authorizing and appropriations committees and then post the reports on the Lead Office’s public website.

Additionally, Lead Office staff said if efforts to bring a PHA into compliance are unsuccessful, the Lead Office would work in conjunction with PIH and HUD’s Office of General Counsel’s Departmental Enforcement Center to determine if an enforcement action is needed, such as withholding or delaying funds from a PHA or imposing civil money penalties on a PHA. Lead Office staff also told us that instead of imposing a fine on a PHA, HUD would rather work with the PHA to resolve the lead paint hazard. However, the Lead Office provided no documentation detailing the specific steps or time frames HUD staff would follow to determine when a noncompliance case is escalated to the Office of General Counsel.

In the same report, HUD notes PIH and the Lead Office will continue to work with PHAs to ensure compliance with lead paint regulations. By adopting procedures that clearly describe when lead paint hazard compliance efforts are no longer sufficient and enforcement decisions are needed, HUD can better keep PHAs accountable in a consistent and timely manner. The standard HUD uses to identify children with elevated blood lead levels and initiate lead hazard control activities in its rental assistance aligns with the health guideline set by CDC in 2012. HUD also uses CDC’s health guideline in its lead grant programs. In HUD’s January 2017 amendment to the Lead Safe Housing Rule, HUD made its standard for lead in a child’s blood more stringent by lowering it from 20 micrograms to 5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood, matching CDC’s health guideline (i.e., blood lead reference value)."

      "The defense lab enterprise consists of 63 labs, warfare centers, and engineering centers across the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as shown in Figure 1 below. About 50,000 federally employed scientists and engineers work at these defense labs to support warfighter needs and develop transformative capabilities. Defense labs are managed and operated within the military service chain of command. DOD budgets for technology and product development activities under its research, development, test, and evaluation budget, which DOD groups into seven budget activity categories for its annual budget estimates. Air Force and Army labs rely on appropriated funding provided from the service—often referred to as mission funding—or from customers (or some combination thereof). Customers, such as program offices, provide funding to defense labs for technology development activities and related research. The Air Force and Army funding structure is in contrast to Navy research and development activities, which operate under the Navy Working Capital Fund—a revolving fund that finances Department of the Navy activities on a reimbursable basis. Under this funding model, the Navy employs a Capital Investment Program to obtain capital assets, including minor military construction projects for labs. The program provides the framework for planning, coordinating, and controlling Navy working capital funds and expenditures to obtain capital assets. Figure 2 illustrates the varying funding models used by the military service labs. In addition to its labs, DOD sponsors other entities to provide for its technology development needs. Specifically, these include: FFRDCs are operated by universities, other not-for-profit or nonprofit organizations, or private firms under long-term contracts and provide special research and development services that generally cannot be readily satisfied by government personnel or private contractors. For example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory develops key radar and electronic warfare technologies for integrated air and missile defense systems.",
      "The Navy invested more than $700 thousand in laboratory initiated research authority funds to commission a Ballast Water Research Lab at Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division. Through the use of this new facility, engineers will be able to study ways to treat ballast water to prevent introduction of non- native aquatic species into a new environment that can be disastrous for the marine life that already inhabit that environment, and ensure that the Navy is able to meet various port regulations around the world for its ships. The Air Force Research Laboratory invested funds in fiscal year 2017 to renovate an existing facility to provide high performance computing capability to aid the rapid development of “game-changing” technologies and weapon systems. Officials at the Army’s Space and Missile Defense Command Technical Center noted they used the laboratory initiated research authority for the first time in fiscal year 2018 because the current executive director, who assumed the position in 2017, prioritized implementing this authority. Most of the Center’s planned investments are focused on workforce development and laboratory infrastructure projects; officials cited a high energy laser technology lab as one of the projects being supported by the revitalization, recapitalization, or minor military construction portion of this authority. Although the majority of defense labs reported using the laboratory initiated research authority, interviews we conducted throughout our review, along with other DOD reports, identified certain obstacles that have, at times, impeded wider usage. DOD-wide military construction funding restrictions. DOD restrictions limit the amount of laboratory initiated research authority funds that labs can spend on lab infrastructure. DOD’s limit is $6 million for the revitalization and recapitalization projects that can be funded under the laboratory initiated research authority. Lab officials stated that this amount is often insufficient to construct advanced lab facilities."

      "Further, based on FISMA metrics reported for fiscal year 2017, OMB determined that 13 of the 23 agencies were managing risks to their enterprise, while the other 10 agencies were at risk of ineffectively identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and if necessary, recovering from cyber intrusions. Figure 2 summarizes agencies’ efforts to implement the government’s approach and strategy for securing information systems as of fiscal year 2017. Appendix III includes a table that provides an additional overview of the effectiveness of each agency’s implementation of the government’s approach and strategy to securing information systems. Inspectors general determined that more than half of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies did not have effective agency-wide information security programs as of fiscal year 2017. Further, in agency financial statement audit reports for fiscal year 2017, inspectors general reported that, despite improvements being made in information security practices, most of the civilian CFO Act agencies continued to exhibit deficiencies in information security controls. As a result of these deficiencies, inspectors general reported material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting. FISMA requires inspectors general to determine the effectiveness of their respective agencies’ information security programs. To do so, FISMA reporting instructions direct inspectors general to provide a maturity rating for agency information security policies, procedures, and practices related to the five core security functions established in the NIST cybersecurity framework, as well as for the agency-wide information security program. The ratings used to evaluate the effectiveness of agencies’ information security programs are based on a five-level maturity model, as described in table 2. According to this maturity model, Level 4 (managed and measurable) represents an effective level of security. Therefore, if an inspector general rates the agency’s information security program at Level 4 or Level 5, then that agency is considered to have an effective information security program.",
      "Overall, inspectors general for the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported progress in agencies’ information security practices for fiscal year 2017. Specifically, during that time, 17 inspectors general designated information security as either a significant deficiency (11) or material weakness (6) in internal control over financial reporting systems for their agencies. This is a decrease from the previous fiscal year when 19 inspectors general designated information security as a significant deficiency (12) or material weakness (7). Reporting instructions contained in the fiscal year 2017 FISMA metrics directed CIOs to assess their agencies’ progress toward achieving outcomes that strengthen federal cybersecurity. To do this, CIOs evaluated their agencies’ performance in reaching targets for specific FISMA reporting metrics. According to the reporting instructions, certain metrics were selected to represent the administration’s cybersecurity CAP goal. These selected metrics allowed CIOs to evaluate their agencies progress in meeting targets for that goal. The cybersecurity CAP goal for fiscal years 2015 through 2017 was to improve cybersecurity performance by having an ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats impacting the operating information environment; ensuring that only authorized users have access to resources and information; and implementing technologies and processes that reduce the risk of malware. The cybersecurity CAP goal consisted of three priority areas with a total of nine performance indicators. Each of the nine performance indicators had an expected level of performance, or target, for implementation. Table 3 shows the three priority areas and related performance indicators and targets of the cybersecurity CAP goal for fiscal years 2015 through 2017. According to agency CIO assessments for fiscal year 2017, 6 of the 23 agencies met all 9 targets for the cybersecurity CAP goal. More specifically, 8 agencies met all four targets for the information security continuous 16 agencies met the two targets for the identity, credential, and access management priority area; and 17 agencies met all three targets for the anti-phishing and malware defense priority area."

      "Regulations can become obsolete. Several industry stakeholders said regulations also may become obsolete quickly because the Internet industry is rapidly changing. An Internet industry representative noted that there can be large shifts in the Internet industry from year to year, while it often takes an agency much longer than a year to adopt a rule. Industry stakeholders said the flexibility of FTC’s approach allows FTC to adapt continuously to changing market conditions. Rulemakings can be lengthy. FCC officials said that in some cases, rulemakings can take a long time, especially when the issues are complex and there is no statutory deadline. Our previous work on rulemaking found that length of time required for the development and issuance of final rules varied both within and among agencies. Additionally, while some stakeholders suggested that regulations can clarify acceptable practices, other stakeholders, including from industry and academia, said that enforcement actions can send a similar message. According to both a representative from a content provider and an academic, enforcement actions such as settlement agreements, for example, establish precedents that companies can follow, similar to the way that case law developed by courts provides guidance for companies. Although some industry representatives we interviewed said that FTC’s use of settlement agreements provides companies with guidance, certain trade associations took a different position in a recent case brought before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, FTC v. Wyndham Worldwide Corp. 799 F.3d 236 (3d Cir. 2015). However, the court did not agree with the associations’ arguments. The case involved an enforcement action against Wyndham Worldwide Corporation where FTC alleged that data security failures led to three data breaches at the company in less than 2 years. The court considered whether FTC could bring an enforcement case involving cybersecurity using FTC’s section 5 “unfair practices” authority and, if so, whether Wyndham had “fair notice” that its specific cybersecurity practices could be deemed “unfair.”",
      "Another former federal enforcement official said that regulations give companies fair notice of what actions may be violations and thus help those companies avoid surprising or unexpected enforcement. Regulations can be flexible. An academic said that by targeting behaviors and not specific technologies, regulations can be written in such a way that they do not become obsolete. An academic also said that regulations based on broad performance-standards principles can avoid being overly prescriptive. FCC officials also noted that regulations can be amended to adapt to changes in technology often faster than new laws can be enacted. Furthermore, regulations determined to be obsolete can be repealed. FTC staff told us that the agency systematically reviews all of its regulations every 10 years, even though it is only legally required to review its most significant ones, and that the number of FTC regulations has decreased because the agency determined prior ones were obsolete. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires federal agencies to analyze the effect of their regulations on small entities. Regulations can be a deterrent. FCC officials said that rules can have a deterrent effect on bad practices in the industry or have a role in mitigating the negative effects of bad practices after they occur. They said, for example, that the practice of pretexting (improperly obtaining people’s telephone records) was greatly curtailed by an FCC regulation prohibiting such practices. They also said that rules can foreclose arguments by companies claiming that because no rule was in place, they had no reasonable notice or awareness that they should behave in a particular way. Consumer advocacy groups and other stakeholders, including some former FTC and FCC commissioners, had concerns about the efficacy of an enforcement approach such as FTC’s approach to Internet privacy oversight, which focuses on enforcing a statute rather than implementing regulations. They said that FTC’s enforcement approach limits the ability of the agency to affect companies’ behavior, and that any enforcement activity occurs after the violation, undesirable behavior, harm, or illegal action has already occurred."

    "question": "The EPA's construction grant funding for FY1988 was $2.304 billion, which was less than the $2.4 billion requested by the President. However, the final appropriation for FY1989 was $1.95 billion, which was less than the $2.4 billion requested for FY1988. In the FY1993 act, appropriators moved funding into the SRF/construction grants account, thereby providing a degree of protection from competing priorities.

    "documentation": [
      "The final total of construction grant monies was $2.361 billion. For FY1988 the President again requested $2.0 billion. In December 1987, Congress approved legislation providing FY1988 appropriations ( P.L. 100-202 , the omnibus continuing resolution to fund EPA and other federal agencies). In it, Congress appropriated $2.304 billion for construction grants. Final action on the EPA budget and other funding bills had been delayed by budget-cutting talks between Congress and the White House. Reduced construction grants funding was one of many spending cuts required to implement a congressional-White House \"summit agreement\" on the budget. The final construction grants appropriation was less than funding levels that had been included in separate versions of a bill passed by the House and Senate before the budget summit, $2.4 billion. For FY1989, President Reagan requested $1.5 billion, or 35% below FY1988 appropriations and 37.5% less than the authorized level of $2.4 billion for FY1989. In separate versions of an EPA appropriations bill, the House and Senate voted to provide $1.95 billion and $2.1 billion respectively. The final figure, in P.L. 100-404 , was $1.95 billion, which included $68 million for special projects in four states. Thus, the actual amount provided for grants was $1.882 billion. That total was divided equally between the previous Title II grants program and new Title VI SRF program, as provided in the authorizing language of P.L. 100-4 . The FY1989 legislation was the first to include earmarking of funds for specified projects or grants in EPA's construction grants account, an action that continued in subsequent years, as discussed above. All of the projects funded in the 1989 legislation were ones that had been authorized in provisions of the Water Quality Act of 1987 (WQA, P.L. 100-4 ). The designated projects were in Boston (authorized in Section 513 of the WQA, to fund the Boston Harbor wastewater treatment project), San Diego/Tijuana (Section 510, to fund an international sewage treatment project needed because of the flow of raw sewage from Tijuana, Mexico, across the border), Des Moines, IA (Section 515, for sewage treatment plant construction), and Oakwood Beach/Redhook, NY (Section 512 of the WQA, to relocate natural gas distribution facilities that were near wastewater treatment works in New York City).",
      "During congressional hearings on the EPA request, many Members criticized the requested 30% decrease in funds for clean water SRF capitalization grants. This criticism was reflected to some degree in appropriations bills the Appropriations Committees subsequently approved that include EPA funding. In July 2016, the House passed H.R. 5538 , FY2017 Interior and Environment Appropriations Act; it included $1.0 billion for clean water SRF grants, $1.07 billion for drinking water SRF grants, and $1.06 billion for state categorical grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a companion bill, S. 3068 , in June. It included $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $1.02 billion for drinking water SRF grants, and $1.09 billion for state categorical grants. The Senate did not take up this bill. Congress did not reach final agreement on an EPA funding bill before the start of FY2017. However, on September 28, the House and Senate passed a 10-week continuing resolution that extended FY2016 funding levels, minus a 0.496% across-the-board reduction, through December 9, 2016 ( P.L. 114-223 ). A second continuing resolution, passed in December 2014, extended FY2016 funding levels, minus a 0.1901% across-the-board reduction, from December 10, 2016, through April 28, 2017 ( P.L. 114-254 ). The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget submission also included a $15 million request to allow EPA to begin making water infrastructure project loans under a program that Congress enacted in 2014, the Water Infrastructure Financing and Investment Act, or WIFIA. P.L. 114-254 included the first appropriation, $20 million, for EPA to do so. The FY2017 final appropriations act (discussed below) provided an additional $8 million for EPA's WIFIA program (and $2 million for EPA to administer the program). Final full-year appropriations were enacted as part of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017, signed by President Trump on May 5, 2017 ( P.L. 115-31 ). The act provided the same level of funding for water infrastructure as FY2016: $1.394 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants ($414 million above President Obama's request), $863 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants ($158 million less than President Obama's request), and $30 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border water infrastructure projects.",
      "In the FY1993 act, appropriators moved funding into the SRF/construction grants account, thereby providing a degree of protection from competing priorities. In FY1996, Congress included all state grants for management of environmental programs in a single consolidated grants appropriation. In doing so, Congress endorsed a Clinton Administration proposal for a more flexible approach to state grants, a key element of EPA's efforts to improve the federal-state partnership in environmental programs. In more recent years, Congress has provided specific funding amounts for certain programs within the categorical grants appropriation. This section summarizes, in chronological order, congressional activity to fund items in the STAG account since the 1987 CWA amendments. The authorization period covered by P.L. 100-4 was FY1986-FY1994. By the time the amendments were enacted, FY1986 was over, as was a portion of FY1987. Thus, appropriations for those two years only indirectly reflected the policy and program changes for later years that were contained in P.L. 100-4 . For FY1986, Congress appropriated a total of $1.8 billion, consisting of $600 million approved in December 1985 (while Congress was beginning to debate reauthorization legislation that eventually was enacted as P.L. 100-4 in January 1987) and $1.2 billion more in July 1986. For FY1987, while debate on CWA reauthorization continued, President Reagan requested $2.0 billion, consistent with his legislative proposal to terminate the grants program by FY1990. In October 1986, Congress appropriated $2.4 billion ( P.L. 99-500 / P.L. 99-591 ). However, only $1.2 billion of that amount was released immediately, pending enactment of a reauthorization bill, which was then in conference. Following enactment of the Water Quality Act of 1987, remaining FY1987 funds were released as part of a supplemental appropriations bill ( P.L. 100-71 ). Conferees on that measure agreed, however, to shift $39 million of the remaining unreleased grant funds to other priority water quality activities authorized in P.L. 100-4 .",
      "Final full-year appropriations were enacted as part of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, enacted in December 2014 ( P.L. 113-235 ). The legislation provided the same water infrastructure funding levels as in FY2014: $1.45 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants and $907 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants. As with the FY2014 appropriations, the bill provided $15 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border assistance and $1.0 billion for state categorical grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. The Administration's FY2016 budget requested $8.6 billion overall for EPA. The request included $1.116 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants, $1.186 billion for drinking water SRF capitalization grants (31% higher than the FY2016 appropriation), $15 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border projects, and $1.162 billion for state categorical grants, which generally support state and tribal implementation of a range of environmental programs. Although the House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported bills to provide FY2016 appropriations for EPA, final appropriations action for EPA and other agencies occurred as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, signed by the President December 18, 2015 ( P.L. 114-113 ). The bill provided $1.394 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants ($55 million less than FY2015, but $278 million above the President's request), $863 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants ($44 million below the FY2015 level, and $323 million less than the President's request), and $30 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border water infrastructure projects. It also provided $1.06 billion for state categorical grants. President Obama presented the Administration's FY2017 budget in February 2016, requesting $8.3 billion in total for EPA ($127 million above the FY2016 enacted budget). The request for EPA included $979.5 million for clean water SRF capitalization grants ($424 million less than the FY2016 enacted level), $1.02 billion for drinking water SRF capitalization grants ($157 million above the FY2016 amount), $22 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border projects, and $1.158 billion for state categorical grants, which generally support state and tribal implementation of environmental programs."
