According to FCC officials, the Commission has not determined how it will address this requirement, but it is currently considering its options, including potentially addressing the requirement as part of its ongoing proposed rulemaking on modernizing the Form 477 data collection. The FCC's decision to address the need for more accurate and complete data on broadband access for tribal lands is a requirement mandated by Congress, and the Commission must carefully consider the potential impact of inaccurate data on tribal communities. Tribal governments have expressed concerns that the current process overstates broadband access on their lands, which could limit their ability to access federal funding to increase broadband access on their lands. The FCC's evaluation of broadband coverage on tribal lands that relies on the current Form 477 data would be subject to the limitations described above, including the overstatement of broadband access on tribal lands, and would likely require significant additional data collection efforts.

For the Department of State and USAID, as well as the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard, FY2019 OCO levels have not yet been determined. They remain at prorated FY2018 levels because of continuing resolutions (CR) to fund certain agencies through December 21, 2018.

Lawmakers may consider the following questions: Will Congress keep the BCA as is and rely on OCO funding that is not subject to the caps to meet agency requirements? Will Congress repeal the BCA and use less OCO funding? Will Congress amend the BCA limits for future years and continue to use OCO funding, as it has in the past?

Critics argue that the rule has led to a decrease in lending to small businesses and individuals, while proponents claim that it has helped to reduce the risk of bank failures. However, some researchers suggest that the rule's impact on lending practices may be more complex than initially thought. According to a recent study, the Volcker Rule has led to a shift in lending behavior among community banks, with some institutions increasing their lending to small businesses and individuals in response to the rule's restrictions on proprietary trading. This shift in behavior has been attributed to the rule's unintended consequences, such as the increased complexity of regulatory requirements and the need for banks to diversify their revenue streams. Nevertheless, others argue that the rule's benefits in reducing systemic risk outweigh its costs, particularly in the context of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

    "question": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has established a set-aside of 50% of discretionary funds for future obligation in all LOIs. However, the current apportionment system relies on a $3.2 billion funding level trigger mechanism to lift most of the apportionments to twice their formula level. If this trigger is breached, entitlements for all airports would be reduced drastically. Some argue that allowing large and medium hub airports to opt out of AIP and rely exclusively on Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs) to finance capital projects could reduce the amount of trust fund revenue needed for AIP. This could potentially alleviate the constraint on discretionary funds, but would also eliminate the land use requirements and airport revenue use restrictions for these airports. On the other hand, critics argue that the increased flexibility in using entitlements for large and medium hub airports could divert resources from capacity and safety projects. If the AIP budget is constrained in the future, and the entitlement formulas remain as they are, the discretionary portion of the AIP budget may be squeezed, limiting large airports' ability to draw on AIP funds for major capacity expansion projects.
