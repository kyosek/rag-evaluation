    "question": "**\n\nConsider the following information about FHA-insured loans:\n\n1. FHA-insured loans can be used for various purposes, including purchasing, repairing, or improving a home, and refinancing an existing home loan. The maximum loan term is 30 years, and the interest rate is negotiated between the borrower and lender. The down payment requirement is 3.5% for borrowers with credit scores of 580 or above, but this can increase to 10% for borrowers with credit scores between 500 and 579. Borrowers with credit scores below 500 are not eligible for FHA-insured loans.\n\n2. FHA-insured loans are available to owner-occupants who can demonstrate the ability to repay the loan. The borrower's prospective mortgage payment should not exceed 31% of gross effective monthly income, and total obligations, including the proposed housing expenses, should not exceed 43% of gross effective monthly income. Borrowers with a history of mortgage foreclosure are not eligible for FHA-insured loans for at least three years after the foreclosure.\n\n3. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was created in 1934 to encourage lending for housing and stimulate the construction industry. It introduced 20-year mortgages with full repayment at the end of the loan term, which helped to instill confidence in the mortgage market. FHA-insured loans are intended to facilitate access to affordable mortgages for households who might not be well-served by the private market, especially during economic downturns.\n\n4. FHA-insured loans are considered delinquent if a payment is due and not paid. Once the borrower is 30 days late, the mortgage is considered to be in default. Mortgage servicers may initiate foreclosure on an FHA-insured loan when three monthly installments are due and unpaid, and they must initiate foreclosure when six monthly installments are due and unpaid, except when prohibited by law.\n\n5. Over one-third of all FHA loans were obtained by minority households, and FHA-insured mortgages accounted for about 57% of all forward mortgages made to low- or moderate-income borrowers during the year. FHA-insured mortgages are often obtained by borrowers with lower credit scores, but they are prohibited from carrying features such as negative amortization.\n\nGiven the above information, which of the following statements is true about FHA-insured loans?",

The CVN-79's construction benefits from lessons learned on the CVN-78, which had cost overruns. The CVN-79's cost cap was adjusted in 2013 to address inflation and incorporate design improvements. The Navy and the shipbuilder have made significant changes to reduce the cost of building the CVN-79. The CVN-79's construction is expected to be completed within its budgeted end cost, and any deferred work will be completed using CVN 78 end cost funding. The CVN-79's construction benefits from the maturation of technologies used on the CVN-78, such as the EMALS and AAG systems. The CVN-79's construction is part of a two-phased strategy, with select ship systems and compartments completed in the second phase of production and test.
