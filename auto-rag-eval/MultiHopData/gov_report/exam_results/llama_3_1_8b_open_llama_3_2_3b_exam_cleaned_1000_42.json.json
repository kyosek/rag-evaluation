This delay may have contributed to the program's cost breach. However, the program's submission did include a detailed analysis of the program's affordability, which was required by DHS's acquisition policy. The program's cost breach was primarily due to increases in costs for contractor labor and support for facilities and infrastructure. The program's APB cost threshold for O&M increased by $110 million (23 percent) when it re-baselined in November 2017. The program's annual LCCE update should inform the affordability submission to support the annual resource allocation process and can be completed at any point during the fiscal year leading up to this process. The Coast Guard's limited internal cost estimating capability and reliance on outside sources for this service led to delays in completing the annual LCCEs for three programs.

    "question": "A digital economy firm, such as Facebook or Google, operates a two-sided market where users consume free services in exchange for advertising revenue. This business model is often criticized for creating \"monopoly power\" in the digital economy. However, proponents argue that the value created in these markets is not solely due to the actions of individual users, but rather the innovations and assets of the companies themselves. Furthermore, the presence of competing catalog retailers should have driven prices down close to marginal costs, but the digital economy firms' ability to aggregate large amounts of data points across millions of users allows them to maintain higher prices. As a result, the government's decision to impose a DST on digital economy firms may have unintended consequences on the overall economy. What is the likely effect of a DST on the digital economy firms' ability to invest in new technologies and platforms?",

In a separate study, researchers found that LGBTQ youth were at heightened risk of experiencing homelessness, and that this risk was more pronounced among youth who were parenting and unmarried. Furthermore, a longitudinal survey of middle school and high school youth found that youth who lived away from home for extended periods were vulnerable to multiple problems, including untreated mental health disorders and drug use.
