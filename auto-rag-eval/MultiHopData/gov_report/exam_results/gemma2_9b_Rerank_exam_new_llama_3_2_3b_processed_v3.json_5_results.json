However, the current staffing levels in FIMA's hazard mitigation cadre are insufficient to support the desired level of in-person participation in recovery scoping meetings, particularly in the early stages of PA project development. This can lead to delays in identifying hazard mitigation opportunities, as noted by a FIMA official. Furthermore, the lack of clear roles and responsibilities for participants in the system testing and integration process can exacerbate these issues. According to FEMA's after-action reports, the test implementation in Oregon lacked sufficient hazard mitigation specialists to cover all site inspections, and the test implementation in Georgia missed opportunities to pursue hazard mitigation due to the lack of hazard mitigation specialists.
