The CVN-79 is part of a class of carriers, with the next ship, the CVN-80, expected to cost $12.6 billion. The CVN-79's construction benefits from lessons learned on the CVN-78, which had cost overruns. The CVN-79's cost cap was adjusted in 2013 to address inflation and incorporate design improvements.

The CVN-79's construction is expected to be completed within its budgeted end cost, and any deferred work will be completed using CVN 78 end cost funding. The CVN-79's construction benefits from the maturation of technologies used on the CVN-78, such as the EMALS and AAG systems. The CVN-79's construction is part of a two-phased strategy, with select ship systems and compartments completed in the second phase of production and test.

The new delivery model is being tested and refined through feedback and lessons learned from recent disasters, such as Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The PA program is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), which is a no-year account with two categories: disaster relief costs associated with major disasters under the Stafford Act and base funding for activities not tied to major disasters. FMAGs (Federal Management Assistance Grants) are funded through the DRF's base funding category and are not contingent on the DRF balance. FMAGs are typically used for urgent needs and are subject to a cost-share of 75% federal and 25% grantee and subgrantee costs.\n\nWhich of the following statements is NOT true about the new delivery model of the FEMA Public Assistance program?",
