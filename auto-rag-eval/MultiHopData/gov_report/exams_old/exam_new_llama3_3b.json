    "question": "The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund was established to support domestic miners who suffer from black lung disease, a condition caused by inhaling coal dust. According to the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977, the excise tax on coal is imposed on \"coal from mines located in the United States\" and does not apply to imported coal. However, some argue that the tax is not sufficient to cover the costs of black lung benefits programs, citing the decline in coal production and the resulting decrease in tax revenue. What is a potential consequence of the decline in coal production on the revenue generated by the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund?",
    "choices": [
      "A) The decline in coal production will lead to an increase in tax revenue, as the tax rate is fixed at $1.10 per ton for underground coal mines.",
      "B) The decline in coal production will lead to a decrease in tax revenue, as the tax rate is fixed at 4.4% of the sales price for underground coal mines.",
      "C) The decline in coal production will lead to a decrease in tax revenue, as the tax rate is fixed at $0.50 per ton for underground coal mines and $0.25 per ton for surface mines.",

      "Coal accounted for 17 percent of energy production (30 percent of electricity production) in the United States in 2016. To generate this energy, approximately 730 million tons of coal were mined domestically in 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, approximately 40 percent of which was produced on federal lands. As of 2016, state regulatory authorities and OSMRE had received financial assurances associated with coal mines that had been permitted to disturb approximately 2.3 million acres, according to OSMRE data. Coal is mined in two different ways: surface mining and underground mining. In surface coal mining, before the underlying coal can be extracted, the land is cleared of forests and other vegetation and topsoil is removed and stored for later use. Explosives or other techniques are then used to break up the overlying solid rock, creating dislodged earth, rock, and other materials known as spoil. Surface coal mines can cover an area of many square miles. In underground coal mining, tunnels are dug to access coal that is too deep for surface mining methods. In some cases, underground coal mines are designed to leave sufficient coal in the mine to support the overlying surface, and in other cases, they are designed to extract higher quantities of coal that results in subsidence of the overlying surface as mining progresses. In addition to disturbing the land surface, coal mining can affect water quality, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Academies, and others. For example, mining can increase sediments in rivers or streams, which may negatively affect aquatic species. Moreover, mining can expose minerals and heavy metals to air and water, leading to a condition known as acid mine drainage, which can lead to long-term water pollution and harm some fish and wildlife species. Mining can also lower the water table or change surface drainage patterns. The surface effects of coal mining in the United States are regulated under SMCRA, which also created OSMRE to administer the act.",

      "Table A-1 (in Appendix A) lists the top GHG emission sources in the United States. These sources combined to account for approximately 95% of U.S. GHG emissions in 2016. Table A-1 identifies the number of entities for each source category (e.g., number of coal mines, number of steel production facilities) and the percentage of total U.S. GHG emissions the category contributes. In the case of fossil fuel combustion\u2014which accounted for 76% of total U.S. GHG emissions\u2014the table provides several options for segmenting the universe of sources if policymakers choose to implement a carbon tax. It identifies the number of entities that might be subject to the carbon tax under a particular option (pending any exclusions). For example, policymakers could address fossil fuel combustion emissions by applying a carbon tax to fossil fuels (based on their carbon content) at the following entities, which include both upstream and midstream infrastructure chokepoints: 137 petroleum refineries (based on 2017 data) and 166 petroleum importers (based on 2018 data); 671 coal mines and eight companies supplying imported coal (based on 2017 data); and 1,679 entities that report natural gas deliveries to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Form EIA-176 and 123 natural gas fractionators (based on 2016 data). Some of the above points of taxation might take advantage of the administrative frameworks for existing federal excise taxes. For example, a per-barrel federal excise tax on crude oil at the refinery supports the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. An excise tax on the sale or use of coal supports the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. A central policy choice when establishing a price on GHG emissions is the rate of the carbon tax. Several approaches, which are discussed below, could inform the decision. One approach would set the carbon tax rate at a level or pathway\u2014based on modeling estimates\u2014that would achieve a specific GHG emissions target. For example, a 2018 study estimated the carbon tax rate needed to meet the U.S. GHG emission reduction targets established under the 2015 Paris Agreement: 26%-28% below 2005 net GHG emission levels by 2025.",
      "On January 1, 2019, the BLET rates declined to their current levels. The rates that took effect January 1, 2019, would also have taken effect if the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund had repaid, with interest, all amounts borrowed from the General Fund of the Treasury. The tax is imposed on \"coal from mines located in the United States\" and does not apply to imported coal. The tax is designed to support the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund for domestic miners. Very little domestically consumed coal is imported. The BLET also does not apply to exported coal under the Export Clause of the United States Constitution. A credit or refund can be claimed if coal is taxed before it is exported. Black lung excise tax collections have generally declined in recent years (see Figure 3 ). In FY2009, more than $650 million was collected from the BLET. In FY2017, collections were about $429 million. The decline in BLET collections follows the general decline in U.S. coal production. As the price of coal rose in the 2000s, coal mined underground tended to pay the tax at a fixed rate of $1.10 per ton, as opposed to paying 4.4% of the sales price. In the years beyond 2018, coal excise tax receipts are expected to fall sharply, reflecting the decrease in the coal excise tax rate (see Figure 3 ). The excise tax on coal was established to help ensure the coal industry shared in the social costs imposed by black lung disease. Over time, the rate of the tax has been increased, in an effort to provide sufficient revenue to meet this objective. The Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 ( P.L. 95-227 ) first imposed the Section 4121 excise tax on coal. When enacted, the tax was $0.50 per ton for coal from underground mines, and $0.25 per ton for coal from surface mines. The tax was limited to 2% of the sales price. The tax was effective for sales after March 31, 1978. Before P.L. 95-227 was enacted there was considerable debate surrounding how black lung benefits programs should be financed. Various mechanisms to shift the costs of the black lung benefits program to the coal industry and its customers were considered."

Further, the funding amounts specified in P.L. 109-54 were reduced slightly. First, a provision of P.L. 109-54 , Section 439, mandated an across-the-board rescission of 0.476% for any discretionary appropriation in that bill. Second, in December 2005 Congress enacted P.L. 109-148 , the FY2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, and Section 3801 of that bill mandated a 1% across-the-board rescission for discretionary accounts in any FY2006 appropriation act (except for discretionary authority of the Department of Veterans Affairs). As a result of these two rescissions, the final levels for the STAG account were $887 million for clean water SRF grants; $838 million for drinking water SRF grants; $281 million for 259 earmarked grants in listed communities, Alaska Native Villages, and along the U.S.-Mexico border; and $1.11 billion for categorical state grants, which could address a range of environmental programs.

      "According to subcommittee documents, the reduction was appropriate because, despite recent federal support, little progress has been made to reduce the known water infrastructure gap. The full committee did not complete markup of this bill. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies drafted an alternative bill that would have maintained funding for the clean water SRF program at $1.45 billion and funding for the drinking water SRF program at $907 million. There was no further action on this bill. Congress did not reach final agreement on FY2014 appropriations before the start of the fiscal year on October 1, but did agree to a short-term continuing appropriations measure ( P.L. 113-46 ), which provided funding through January 15, 2014. Final action on appropriations for EPA and all other federal agencies and departments occurred as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 ( H.R. 3547 , P.L. 113-76 ), signed by the President on January 17, 2014. This bill provides $1.45 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants (5% more than FY2013 funds and 32% higher than the President's FY2014 budget request) and $907 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants (5% more than FY2013 funds and 11% higher than the President's FY2014 budget request). The bill also provides $15 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border assistance, and $1.0 billion for state categorical grants, which generally support state and tribal implementation of a range of environmental programs. President Obama presented the Administration's FY2015 budget on March 4, 2014. It sought $7.89 billion overall for EPA, including $1.018 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants, $757 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants, $15 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border projects, and $1.13 billion for state categorical grants.

      "A number of federal courts of appeals have ruled that students enrolled in public universities have liberty and/or property interests in their education and that expulsion and certain suspensions can constitute a deprivation of that interest. As discussed in further detail below, as a baseline matter, federal courts have held that due process requires public schools to provide students with notice of the charges against them, the evidence used to make a determination, and the ability to present their side of the story to an unbiased decisionmaker. Of course, whether a public university has afforded a student due process \"is a fact-intensive inquiry and the procedures required to satisfy due process will necessarily vary depending on the particular circumstances of each case.\" While colleges and universities have developed various procedures to comply with OCR's guidance regarding an institution's response to allegations of sexual harassment, a number of individuals subject to these disciplinary processes have challenged some of these procedures in federal court. Several courts have since issued decisions in cases brought by students asserting a due process violation in the context of a Title IX investigation or adjudicatory proceeding. The following section discusses recent notable judicial rulings that address the constitutionality of disciplinary proceedings in the context of sexual misconduct. The discussion below is organized by the type of claim raised against the public university: 1. the university failed to provide adequate notice of the charges against the student; 2. the university did not permit the accused student to confront and challenge the credibility of witnesses who testified against him; 3. the university allowed biased decisionmakers to oversee the proceedings; and 4. the university employed unfair review processes when rehearing an allegation brought by a complainant. Importantly, some of the judicial rulings discussed below address whether a student's stated claim is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss and do not reach conclusive determinations about the evidence sufficient to establish a due process violation.",

      "In the public university context, a number of students subject to disciplinary sanctions for misconduct thus challenged the disciplinary procedures in state and federal courts as unconstitutional. In particular, a number of students faced with disciplinary action by public universities have raised constitutional challenges to the Title IX procedures used to find them responsible for sexual misconduct, arguing that universities violated the Due Process Clause in the handling of their case. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to observe certain procedures when depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property. In addition to protecting against the deprivation of an individual's physical property, the Constitution guards against the deprivation of certain \"property interests\" without due process. The property interests protected by the Due Process Clause are not themselves created by the Constitution; instead, those interests arise from an independent source, such as state or federal law. To have a protected property interest in a government-created benefit, one must show a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\" that originates in \"existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\" Likewise, when a state deprives an individual of liberty, states must afford due process to the individual. In fact, when a \"person's good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him,\" due process may be implicated. In these circumstances, courts often require an accompanying state action that alters or removes a legal status to constitute a deprivation of liberty. Precisely what procedures are constitutionally required before depriving individuals of a protected interest can vary. When deciding what process is due, courts balance three factors enunciated by the Supreme Court in Ma thews v. Eldridge : (1) \"the private interest that will be affected by the official action\"; (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation and the probable value of additional procedures; and (3) the interest of the government.",
      "In general, the Court has made clear that individuals with a protected interest are entitled to notice of the proposed action and a \"meaningful opportunity to be heard\" before the state may deprive them of that interest. The Supreme Court has explained, however, that due process is not a \"technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place, and circumstances.\" Instead, the concept is \"flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\" In conducting the balancing of factors pursuant to\u00a0 M athews v. Eldridge , the severity of the deprivation is a key factor in determining what procedures are constitutionally required. In general, the stronger the private interest at risk of deprivation, the more formal and exacting procedures will be required by courts. The only Supreme Court case to focus on procedural due process in the (nonacademic) student discipline context is Goss v. Lopez . In that case, high school students challenged their suspension from school for up to 10 days without a hearing. The Court first ruled that the public school students had a \"legitimate entitlement to a public education,\" which was a property interest protected by due process; and that interest was deprived by the suspension. As to the process required, the Court ruled that, at a minimum, \"students facing suspension . . . must be given some kind of notice and some kind of hearing.\" The Court also clarified that cases of more stringent sanctions, such as suspensions beyond 10 days or expulsions, \"may require more formal procedures.\" Generally speaking, because public universities constitute state actors subject to the Due Process Clause, they must comply with constitutional standards when suspending or expelling students. Private universities, on the other hand, do not. The Supreme Court has assumed, without deciding on the merits, that students of public universities enjoy a \"constitutionally protectable property right\" in their continued enrollment in an educational institution.",
      "Similarly, the Sixth Circuit denied a due process challenge to a university's disciplinary hearing concerning sexual assault allegations where students were not permitted to directly cross-examine their accuser. The students were permitted to submit written questions to the hearing panel, but were not permitted to submit any follow-up questions, and the panel failed to ask all of the questions they submitted. The circuit court reasoned that the proceedings satisfied the \"limited\" requirement of cross-examination where credibility is at issue, as the \"marginal benefit that would accrue to the fact-finding process by allowing follow-up questions \u2026 is vastly outweighed by the burden\" on the school. Likewise, the Fifth Circuit rejected a due process challenge to a university's disciplinary proceedings where the challengers argued they were denied the ability to effectively cross-examine witnesses and confront their accuser. In that case, the court noted that the school's decision did not rest on testimonial evidence, but on the videos and a photo taken and distributed by one of the challengers. Where a credibility determination was critical to the outcome of a proceeding, however, courts have often ruled in favor of due process challenges. For instance, the Sixth Circuit held that a university violated due process when it failed to provide any form of cross-examination in the hearing and the disciplinary decision necessarily rested on a credibility determination. In that case, the university based its decision to suspend a student entirely on the hearsay statement of the complainant, who did not appear at the disciplinary hearing. Importantly, the court noted that the suspended student only requested the additional procedure of posing questions to his accuser through the hearing panel, but he did not ask for the opportunity to directly cross-examine her. The court concluded that in such circumstances, some method must be made available to the adjudicative body to \"assess the demeanor of both the accused and his accuser.\""

Note that option B is incorrect because the text does not mention the W80-4 warhead being a low-yield modification of the current W76 warhead as the reason for its funding increase.\n5. Realize that option C is incorrect because while the FY2020 budget request is 12% greater than the FY2019 enacted level, the increase in funding for W80-4 LEP is specifically mentioned as a 37% increase, not a result of the overall increase.\n6.

      "Because ARPA-E provides advance funding for projects for up to three years, oversight and management of the program would still be required during a phaseout period. According to the Administration budget request, \"ARPA-E will utilize the remainder of its unobligated balances to execute the multi-year termination of the program, with all operations ceasing by FY 2022.\" The FY2020 budget request for DOE Weapons Activities is 12% greater than the FY2019 enacted level ($12.4 billion vs. $11.1 billion). Weapons Activities programs are carried out by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semiautonomous agency within DOE. Under Weapons Activities, FY2020 funding for nuclear warhead life-extension programs (LEPs) would increase by 10% ($2.1 billion vs $1.9 billion). The two most notable increases within that account are the funding request for W80-4 LEP, which increases by 37% ($898.6 million vs. $654.8 million) and the initiation of funding for the W87-1 LEP. The increase in the request for the W80-4 warhead, which is due to be carried on the new long-range standoff weapon (a new cruise missile), apparently is the result of a new budget estimate, as the Department of Defense is not accelerating development of the missile. The FY2020 request seeks $112 million for the W87-1 warhead (formerly the Interoperable Warhead 1, or IW-I), which received $53 million in FY2019. This warhead is to be carried by the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, a new land-based missile that is scheduled to enter the force in the 2030s. The FY2020 budget request seeks $10 million for the W76-2 LEP, down from $65 million in FY2019. Work on this warhead is nearly complete. It is a low-yield modification of the current W76 warhead carried by U.S. submarine-launched ballistic missiles. It remains controversial in Congress despite its relatively low price tag.

      "US and Iranian naval forces tend to operate in relatively narrow stretches of water, such as the Strait of Hormuz, increasing their frequency of close contact. DOD states that Although China has long challenged foreign military activities in its maritime zones in a manner that is inconsistent with the rules of customary international law as reflected in the LOSC, the PLA has recently started conducting the very same types of military activities inside and outside the first island chain in the maritime zones of other countries. This contradiction highlights China's continued lack of commitment to the rules of customary international law. Even though China is a state party to the LOSC [i.e., UNCLOS], China's domestic laws restrict military activities in its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), including intelligence collection and military surveys, contrary to LOSC. At the same time, the PLA is increasingly undertaking military operations in other countries' EEZs. The map on the following page [not reproduced here] depicts new PLA operating areas in foreign EEZs since 2014. In 2017, the PLAN conducted air and naval operations in Japan's EEZ; employed an AGI [intelligence-gathering ship] ship, likely to monitor testing of a THAAD system in the U.S. EEZ near the Aleutian Islands; and employed an AGI ship to monitor a multi-national naval exercise in Australia's EEZ. PLA operations in foreign EEZs have taken place in Northeast and Southeast Asia, and a growing number of operations are also occurring farther from Chinese shores. The issue of whether China has the right under UNCLOS to regulate foreign military activities in its EEZ is related to, but ultimately separate from, the issue of territorial disputes in the SCS and ECS: The two issues are related because China can claim EEZs from inhabitable islands over which it has sovereignty, so accepting China's claims to sovereignty over inhabitable islands in the SCS or ECS could permit China to expand the EEZ zone within which China claims a right to regulate foreign military activities.",
