    "question": "In 2019, Medicare's coverage for generic drugs in the coverage gap was such that enrollees paid 37% of the cost, while Medicare paid 63%. By 2020, this changed to a 25% cost-sharing for enrollees for both brand-name and generic drugs in the coverage gap. This change was due to a combination of manufacturer discounts and increased Medicare coverage. Additionally, most plans offer actuarially equivalent benefits, including alternatives like reducing or eliminating the deductible, or using tiered cost-sharing with lower cost sharing for generic drugs. Medicare's payments to plans are determined through a competitive bidding process, and enrollee premiums are tied to plan bids. Plans are paid a risk-adjusted monthly per capita amount based on their bids during a given plan year. The federal government is prohibited from interfering in the price negotiations between drug manufacturers, pharmacies, and plans. Part D also provides enhanced coverage for low-income enrolled individuals, such as persons who previously received drug benefits under Medicaid (known as \"dual eligibles\"). Certain persons who do not qualify for Medicaid but whose incomes are below 150% of poverty may also receive assistance for some portion of their premium and cost-sharing charges. The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) included significant incentives for employers to continue to offer coverage to their retirees by providing a 28% federal subsidy. In 2019, the maximum potential subsidy per covered retiree was $2,264 for employers or unions offering drug coverage that is at least actuarially equivalent (called \"creditable\" coverage) to standard coverage. Employers or unions may select an alternative option (instead of taking the subsidy) with respect to Part D, such as electing to pay a portion of the Part D premiums.",
