In the theory of compressed sensing (CS), the sparsity ||x||_0 of the unknown signal x\\in\\R^p is commonly assumed to be a known parameter. However, it is typically unknown in practice. Due to the fact that many aspects of CS depend on knowing ||x||_0, it is important to estimate this parameter in a data-driven way. A second practical concern is that ||x||_0 is a highly unstable function of x. In particular, for real signals with entries not exactly equal to 0, the value ||x||_0=p is not a useful description of the effective number of coordinates. In this paper, we propose to estimate a stable measure of sparsity s(x):=||x||_1^2/||x||_2^2, which is a sharp lower bound on ||x||_0. Our estimation procedure uses only a small number of linear measurements, does not rely on any sparsity assumptions, and requires very little computation.
