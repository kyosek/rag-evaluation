We developed a stochastic model, integrating results of single-molecule and quantitative in vivo studies of E. coli, to evaluate the quantitative effect of pausing, termination, and antitermination on rRNA transcription.

Our results suggest the suppression of these pauses by the ribosomal antitermination complex to be essential at fast growth. Moreover, unsuppressed pausing by even a few non-antiterminated RNAPs can already reduce transcription drastically under dense traffic.

Channel allocation is the task of assigning channels to users such that some objective (e.g., sum-rate) is maximized.

In distributed networks such as ad-hoc and device-to-device (D2D) networks, no base station exists and conveying global CSI between users is costly or simply impractical. When the CSI is time varying and unknown to the users, the users face the challenge of both learning the channel statistics online and converge to a good channel allocation. This introduces a multi-armed bandit (MAB) scenario with multiple decision makers. If two users or more choose the same channel, a collision occurs and they all receive zero reward.

Experimental and theoretical studies of colloidal nanoparticles have primarily focused on accurate characterization and simulation of observable characteristics, such as resonant wavelength.

We combine theory and experiment to answer each of these questions. We derive general bounds on the maximum cross-sections per volume, and we apply an analytical antenna model to show that resonant nanorods should nearly achieve such bounds. We use a modified seed-mediated synthesis approach to synthesize ensembles of gold nanorods with small polydispersity, i.e., small variations in size and aspect ratio. Polydispersity is the key determinant of how closely such ensembles can approach their respective bounds yet is difficult to characterize experimentally without near-field measurements. We show that a certain \"extinction metric,\" connecting extinction cross-section per volume with the radiative efficiencies of the nanoparticles, offers a quantitative prediction of polydispersity via quantities that can be rapidly measured with far-field characterization tools.

Abnormal iron accumulation in the brain subcortical nuclei has been reported to be correlated to various neurodegenerative diseases, which can be measured through the magnetic susceptibility from the quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). To quantitively measure the magnetic susceptibility, the nuclei should be accurately segmented, which is a tedious task for clinicians.
