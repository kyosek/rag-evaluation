This paper focuses on wireless energy transfer (WET) to a pair of low complex energy receivers (ER), by only utilizing received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values that are fed back from the ERs to the energy transmitter (ET). Selecting the beamformer that maximizes the total average energy transfer between the ET and the ERs, while satisfying a minimum harvested energy criterion at each ER, is studied. This is a nonconvex constrained optimization problem which is difficult to solve analytically. Also, any analytical solution to the problem should only consists of parameters that the ET knows, or the ET can estimate, as utilizing only RSSI feedback values for channel estimation prohibits estimating some channel parameters. Thus, the paper focuses on obtaining a suboptimal solution analytically. It is proven that if the channels between the ET and the ERs satisfy a certain sufficient condition, this solution is in fact optimal. Simulations show that the optimality gap is negligibly small as well. Insights into a system with more than two ERs are also presented. To this end, it is highlighted that if the number of ERs is large enough, it is possible to always find a pair of ERs satisfying the sufficient condition, and hence, a pairwise scheduling policy that does not violate optimality can be used for the WET."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the context of wireless energy transfer (WET) to a pair of energy receivers (ERs) using signal strength feedback, what is the sufficient condition that must be satisfied by the channels between the energy transmitter (ET) and the ERs for the suboptimal solution obtained in the paper to be optimal?\n\n**A)** The channels must be symmetric and have the same gain in both directions.\n**B)** The channels must satisfy the condition that the sum of the gains of the two channels is greater than or equal to the minimum harvested energy criterion at each ER.\n**C)** The channels must be orthogonal to each other, meaning that they do not overlap in frequency or space.\n**D)** The channels must have a minimum gain in one direction and a maximum gain in the other direction.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) The channels must satisfy the condition that the sum of the gains of the two channels is greater than or equal to the minimum harvested energy criterion at each ER.\n\n**Explanation:** The paper states that if the channels between the ET and the ERs satisfy a certain sufficient condition, the suboptimal solution obtained is in fact optimal.

For metallic (e.g. Fe on Pb) or semiconducting (e.g. InSb on Nb) nanowires, the renormalization effect is found to be very strong and weak respectively because the transverse confinement size in the two situations happens to be 0.5nm (metallic nanowire) and 20nm (semiconducting nanowire).

However, larger features such as increases or modes can be detected using statistical tests.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is A) because the documentation states that the statistical challenge in the random coefficients model is to recover information about the joint density, which is a multivariate and ill-posed problem. The curse of dimensionality and ill-posedness make pointwise nonparametric estimation of the joint density difficult, but larger features such as increases or modes can be detected using statistical tests."}, "42": {"documentation": {"title": "CoinTossX: An open-source low-latency high-throughput matching engine", "source": "Ivan Jericevich and Dharmesh Sing and Tim Gebbie", "docs_id": "2102.10925", "section": ["cs.DC", "cs.MA", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.TR"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "CoinTossX: An open-source low-latency high-throughput matching engine.

For ergodic sources, it was shown that GLS-coding achieves the best possible lossless compression (in the noiseless setting) bounded by Shannon entropy.

The PL decay dynamics are dominated by the surface passivation, and a post-synthesis ligand exchange with a quaternary ammonium bromide (QAB) results in a more stable passivation over a larger temperature range. The PL intensity is highest from 50K-250K, which indicates that the ligand binding competes with the thermal energy at ambient temperature.
