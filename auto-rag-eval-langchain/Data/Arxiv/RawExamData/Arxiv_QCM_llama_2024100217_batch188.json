Recurrence networks are powerful tools used effectively in the nonlinear analysis of time series data.

Especially, we find the node strength distribution of the WRN, from every chaotic attractor follows a power law (with exponential tail) with the index characteristic to the fractal structure of the attractor. This leads to a new class among complex networks, to which networks from all standard chaotic attractors are found to belong. In addition, we present generalized definitions for clustering coefficient and characteristic path length and show that these measures can effectively discriminate chaotic dynamics from white noise and $1/f$ colored noise.

In most contemporary approaches to decision making, a decision problem is described by a sets of states and set of outcomes, and a rich set of acts, which are functions from states to outcomes over which the decision maker (DM) has preferences. Most interesting decision problems, however, do not come with a state space and an outcome space. Indeed, in complex problems it is often far from clear what the state and outcome spaces would be. We present an alternative foundation for decision making, in which the primitive objects of choice are syntactic programs. A representation theorem is proved in the spirit of standard representation theorems, showing that if the DM's preference relation on objects of choice satisfies appropriate axioms, then there exist a set S of states, a set O of outcomes, a way of interpreting the objects of choice as functions from S to O, a probability on S, and a utility function on O, such that the DM prefers choice a to choice b if and only if the expected utility of a is higher than that of b. Thus, the state space and outcome space are subjective, just like the probability and utility; they are not part of the description of the problem. In principle, a modeler can test for SEU behavior without having access to states or outcomes. We illustrate the power of our approach by showing that it can capture decision makers who are subject to framing effects."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question**\n\nConsider a decision maker (DM) who is subject to framing effects, and who has the following preferences:\n\n* For states {A, B, C} and outcomes {X, Y, Z}, the DM prefers {X, Y, Z} to {Y, Z, X} if and only if the state is {A, B, C} and the outcome is {X, Y, Z};\n* For states {A, B, C} and outcomes {X, Y, Z}, the DM prefers {Y, Z, X} to {X, Y, Z} if and only if the state is {B, C, A} and the outcome is {Y, Z, X};\n* For states {A, B, C} and outcomes {X, Y, Z}, the DM is indifferent between {X, Y, Z} and {Y, Z, X} if and only if the state is {C, A, B} and the outcome is {X, Y, Z}.\n\nWhich of the following representations of the DM's preferences is equivalent to the DM's original preferences?\n\nA) {S = {A, B, C}, O = {X, Y, Z}, P(S) = {1/3, 1/3, 1/3}, U(O) = {X, Y, Z} > {Y, Z, X}, {Y, Z, X} = {X, Y, Z}}\nB) {S = {A, B, C}, O = {X, Y, Z}, P(S) = {1/3, 1/3, 1/3}, U(O) = {X, Y, Z} > {Y, Z, X}, {Y, Z, X} > {X, Y, Z}}\nC) {S = {A, B, C}, O = {X, Y, Z}, P(S) = {1/3, 1/3, 1/3}, U(O) = {X, Y, Z} > {Y, Z, X}, {Y, Z, X} = {X, Y, Z}}\nD) {S = {A, B, C}, O = {X, Y, Z}, P(S) = {1/3, 1/3, 1/3}, U(O) = {X, Y, Z} > {Y, Z, X}, {Y, Z, X} > {X, Y, Z} and {X, Y, Z} = {Y, Z, X}}\n\n**Correct Answer:** C) {S = {A, B, C}, O = {X, Y, Z}, P(S) = {1/3, 1/3, 1/3}, U(O) = {X, Y, Z} > {Y, Z, X}, {Y, Z, X} = {X, Y, Z}}\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe correct answer is C) because it accurately represents the DM's preferences.
