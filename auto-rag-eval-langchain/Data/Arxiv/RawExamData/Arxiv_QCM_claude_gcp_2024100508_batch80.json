Termite colonies construct towering, complex mounds, in a classic example of distributed agents coordinating their activity via interaction with a shared environment.

Recent research has called this idea into question, pointing to a more complicated behavioral response to cues perceived with multiple senses. In this work, we explored the role of topological cues in affecting early construction activity in Macrotermes. We created artificial surfaces with a known range of curvatures, coated them with nest soil, placed groups of major workers on them, and evaluated soil displacement as a function of location at the end of one hour. Each point on the surface has a given curvature, inclination, and absolute height; to disambiguate these factors, we conducted experiments with the surface in different orientations. Soil displacement activity is consistently correlated with surface curvature, and not with inclination nor height. Early exploration activity is also correlated with curvature, to a lesser degree.

Recent measurements of yields of hadrons and light nuclei covering over 9 orders of magnitudes from the ALICE collaboration at the LHC were described by the model with remarkable accuracy with a chemical freeze-out temperature of 156.5 $\\pm$ 1.5 MeV.

The paper's main result states that the Furuta-Ohta invariant for the mapping torus of a finite-order diffeomorphism of a homology sphere equals the equivariant Casson invariant (Collin-Saveliev 2001) if the action has fixed points, and a version of the Boyer-Nicas (1990) invariant if the action is free. This shows that the result depends on whether the action has fixed points or is free.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the result is not always equal to the equivariant Casson invariant; it depends on the nature of the action.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the invariant is not independent of the nature of the action, and it doesn't always equal a version of the Boyer-Nicas invariant.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the paper does mention that the Furuta-Ohta invariant reduces mod 2 to the Rohlin invariant under certain conditions, this is a separate result from the main calculation of the invariant itself.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the paper's main result and its relation to other known invariants in topology."}, "11": {"documentation": {"title": "Between light and eye: Goethe's science of color and the polar\n  phenomenology of nature", "source": "Alex Kentsis", "docs_id": "physics/0511130", "section": ["physics.hist-ph"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Between light and eye: Goethe's science of color and the polar\n  phenomenology of nature. In his interviews with Eckermann in the 1820s, Goethe referred to his Theory of Colors as his greatest and ultimate achievement. Its reception following publication in 1810 and subsequent reviews throughout the history of physical science did not reflect this self-assessment. Even Hermann von Helmholtz, who in part modeled his scientific work after Goethe's, initially thought that Goethe's poetic genius prevented him from understanding physical science. Why did Goethe champion his Farbenlehre so ardently even years after it was dismissed by almost everyone else? In answering this question, this essay will attempt to add to the existing scholarship by considering Goethe's Theory of Colors in the context of his natural philosophy, and generalizing the variety of objectifications of the concepts invoked by his color theory and their relationships to Goethe's epistemology and Newton's mechanics. In this fashion, I attempt to show that the reason for Goethe's self-assessment of his Theory of Colors is less enigmatic than appears from its examination solely as a work of physics.

The passage suggests that Goethe's Theory of Colors was not merely a work of physics, but a broader philosophical and artistic statement. It represented Goethe's concept of the \"polarity of opposites,\" which he saw as a universal archetype. This theory allowed Goethe to reconcile conflicts between different philosophical approaches (such as those of Kant and Spinoza) and served as a unifying principle for both his artistic and scientific endeavors.
