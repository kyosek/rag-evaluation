The achievements of image semantic segmentation and deep learning approaches on ordinary images have accelerated the research on hyperspectral image classification. Moreover, the utilization of both the spectral and spatial cues in hyperspectral images has shown improved classification accuracy in hyperspectral image classification. The use of only 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNN) to extract both spatial and spectral cues from Hyperspectral images results in an explosion of parameters hence high computational cost.

By minimizing this loss function, the occupation probability of the targeted state is maximized. This is a key aspect of the PIML method, which is to use the physics-informed loss function to guide the optimization of the machine learning model and maximize the occupation probability of the targeted state."}, "59": {"documentation": {"title": "Functional cartography of complex metabolic networks", "source": "Roger Guimera and Luis A.

High-throughput techniques are leading to an explosive growth in the size of biological databases and creating the opportunity to revolutionize our understanding of life and disease. Interpretation of these data remains, however, a major scientific challenge. Here, we propose a methodology that enables us to extract and display information contained in complex networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that one can (i) find functional modules in complex networks, and (ii) classify nodes into universal roles according to their pattern of intra- and inter-module connections. The method thus yields a ``cartographic representation'' of complex networks. Metabolic networks are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with more potential for immediate applicability. We use our method to analyze the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different super-kingdoms. We find that, typically, 80% of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we find that low-degree metabolites that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary finding of the study on functional cartography of complex metabolic networks, and how does it relate to the conservation of metabolites across different organisms?\n\nA) The study found that high-throughput techniques have led to a significant increase in the number of metabolic nodes, resulting in a more complex network structure. However, this complexity does not necessarily imply a greater conservation of metabolites across different organisms.\n\nB) The study demonstrated that low-degree metabolites that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module, suggesting that these metabolites play a crucial role in maintaining network integrity across different organisms.\n\nC) The study found that the majority of nodes in metabolic networks are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, implying that these modules are the primary functional units of the network. However, this does not necessarily imply a greater conservation of metabolites across different organisms.\n\nD) The study concluded that the evolutionary pressures on metabolic networks are primarily driven by the need to maintain module connectivity, rather than the conservation of metabolites across different organisms.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) The study demonstrated that low-degree metabolites that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module, suggesting that these metabolites play a crucial role in maintaining network integrity across different organisms.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is based on the finding that low-degree metabolites that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module. This suggests that these metabolites play a crucial role in maintaining network integrity across different organisms, and that their conservation is essential for the overall function of the metabolic network. This is a key insight from the study, and it highlights the importance of considering the structural properties of metabolic networks when analyzing their conservation across different organisms."}}
