Twisting and bending deformations are crucial to the biological functions of microfilaments such as DNA molecules. Although continuum-rod models have emerged as efficient tools to describe the nonlinear dynamics of these deformations, a major roadblock in the continuum-mechanics-based description of microfilaments is the accurate modeling of the constitutive law, which follows from its atomistic structure and bond-stiffnesses. Since first-principle derivation of the constitutive law from atomistic structure is impractical and so are direct experimental measurements due to the small length-scales, a natural alternative is to estimate the constitutive law from discrete-structure simulations such as molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations. In this paper, we present a two-step inverse method for estimating the constitutive law using rod theory and data generated from discrete-structure simulations. We illustrate the method on a filament with an artificial and simplistic discrete-structure. We simulate its deformation in response to a prescribed loading using a multi-body dynamics (MBD) solver. Using data generated from the MBD solver, we first estimate the curvature of the filament and subsequently use it in the two-step method to estimate the effective constitutive-law relationship between the restoring moment and curvature.

On 4 March 2021 at 9 UTC a 30-m in diameter near-Earth asteroid 2021 DW1 passed the Earth at a distance of 570000 km, reaching the maximum brightness of V=14.6 mag. We observed it photometrically from 2 March, when it was visible at V=16.5 mag, until 7 March (V=18.2 mag). During that time 2021 DW1 swept a 170 degrees long arc in the northern sky, spanning solar phase angles in the range from 36 to 86 degrees. This made it an excellent target for physical characterisation, including spin axis and shape derivation. Convex inversion of the asteroid lightcurves gives a sidereal period of rotation P=0.013760 +/- 0.000001 h, and two solutions for the spin axis ecliptic coordinates: (A) lambda_1=57 +/- 10, beta_1=29 +/- 10, and (B) lambda_2=67 +/- 10, beta_2=-40 +/- 10. The magnitude-phase curve can be fitted with a standard H, G function with H=24.8 +/- 0.5 mag and an assumed G=0.24.

An important biological aspect of these studies is discerning which selection pressures favor the evolution of grouping behavior. In the past decade, researchers have begun using evolutionary computation to study the evolutionary effects of these selection pressures in predator-prey models. The selfish herd hypothesis states that concentrated groups arise because prey selfishly attempt to place their conspecifics between themselves and the predator, thus causing an endless cycle of movement toward the center of the group.
