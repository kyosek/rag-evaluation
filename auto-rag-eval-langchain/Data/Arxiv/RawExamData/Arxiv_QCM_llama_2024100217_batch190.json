We study mesoscopic resonant tunneling as well as multichannel Kondo problems by mapping them to a first-quantized quantum mechanical model of a particle moving in a multi-dimensional periodic potential with Ohmic dissipation.

The coexistence between different types of templates has been the choice solution to the information crisis of prebiotic evolution, triggered by the finding that a single RNA-like template cannot carry enough information to code for any useful replicase. In principle, confining $d$ distinct templates of length $L$ in a package or protocell, whose survival depends on the coexistence of the templates it holds in, could resolve this crisis provided that $d$ is made sufficiently large. Here we review the prototypical package model of Niesert et al. 1981 which guarantees the greatest possible region of viability of the protocell population, and show that this model, and hence the entire package approach, does not resolve the information crisis. This is so because to secure survival the total information content of the protocell, $Ld$, must tend to a constant value that depends only on the spontaneous error rate per nucleotide of the template replication mechanism.

Recent developments in the multi-messenger astronomy through gravitational waves (LIGO/Virgo) or X-ray timing data (NICER) have provided new constraints on the theories of nuclear physics, where an absolute energy density functional from ab-initio modelling is still not available. General relativity guarantees a unique one-to-one correspondence between static observables of neutron stars (NSs) such as mass-radius or tidal deformability and the equation of state (EoS) of beta equilibrated matter. However, these static properties are not enough to predict the composition of the interiors of NSs, even if one assumes that hadrons present in the neutron star core are only neutrons and protons. This statement is demonstrated through a simple analytical method based on a polynomial expansion of the EoS, and it is further reinforced by a full Bayesian analysis.

The first step towards investigating the effectiveness of a treatment is to split the population into the control and the treatment groups, then compare the average responses of the two groups to the treatment. In order to ensure that the difference in the two groups is only caused by the treatment, it is crucial for the control and the treatment groups to have similar statistics. The validity and reliability of trials are determined by the similarity of two groups' statistics. Covariate balancing methods increase the similarity between the distributions of the two groups' covariates.
