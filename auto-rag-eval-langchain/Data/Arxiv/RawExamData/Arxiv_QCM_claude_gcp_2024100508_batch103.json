Twisting and bending deformations are crucial to the biological functions of microfilaments such as DNA molecules. Although continuum-rod models have emerged as efficient tools to describe the nonlinear dynamics of these deformations, a major roadblock in the continuum-mechanics-based description of microfilaments is the accurate modeling of the constitutive law, which follows from its atomistic structure and bond-stiffnesses. Since first-principle derivation of the constitutive law from atomistic structure is impractical and so are direct experimental measurements due to the small length-scales, a natural alternative is to estimate the constitutive law from discrete-structure simulations such as molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations. In this paper, we present a two-step inverse method for estimating the constitutive law using rod theory and data generated from discrete-structure simulations. We illustrate the method on a filament with an artificial and simplistic discrete-structure. We simulate its deformation in response to a prescribed loading using a multi-body dynamics (MBD) solver. Using data generated from the MBD solver, we first estimate the curvature of the filament and subsequently use it in the two-step method to estimate the effective constitutive-law relationship between the restoring moment and curvature.

On 4 March 2021 at 9 UTC a 30-m in diameter near-Earth asteroid 2021 DW1 passed the Earth at a distance of 570000 km, reaching the maximum brightness of V=14.6 mag. We observed it photometrically from 2 March, when it was visible at V=16.5 mag, until 7 March (V=18.2 mag). During that time 2021 DW1 swept a 170 degrees long arc in the northern sky, spanning solar phase angles in the range from 36 to 86 degrees. This made it an excellent target for physical characterisation, including spin axis and shape derivation. Convex inversion of the asteroid lightcurves gives a sidereal period of rotation P=0.013760 +/- 0.000001 h, and two solutions for the spin axis ecliptic coordinates: (A) lambda_1=57 +/- 10, beta_1=29 +/- 10, and (B) lambda_2=67 +/- 10, beta_2=-40 +/- 10. The magnitude-phase curve can be fitted with a standard H, G function with H=24.8 +/- 0.5 mag and an assumed G=0.24. The asteroid colour indices are g-i=0.79 +/- 0.01 mag, and i-z=0.01 +/- 0.02 mag which indicates an S taxonomic class, with an average geometric albedo p_V=0.23 +/- 0.02. The asteroid effective diameter, derived from H and p_V, is D=30 +/- 10 m. It was found that the inclination of the spin axis of 2021 DW1 is not perpendicular to the orbital plane (obliquity epsilon=54 +/- 10 or epsilon=123 +/- 10).

Given this information and the asteroid's estimated diameter of 30 \u00b1 10 m, which of the following statements is most likely true about 2021 DW1?\n\nA) It is experiencing significant YORP effect, causing its rotation to slow down over time.\nB) It is at risk of rotational breakup due to its extremely fast rotation.\nC) Its rotation period is typical for an asteroid of its size.\nD) It has a rubble pile structure that can withstand such rapid rotation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The rotation period of 2021 DW1 is extremely short at about 49.5 seconds. This is exceptionally fast for an asteroid, especially one of this size. Asteroids rotating faster than about 2.2 hours are generally considered to be at risk of rotational breakup unless they have significant internal strength. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while the YORP effect can influence asteroid rotation, it typically causes acceleration, not slowing down, for small asteroids.\n\nOption C is incorrect because this rotation period is far from typical; it's extraordinarily fast.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a rubble pile structure would likely not be able to withstand such rapid rotation without breaking apart. \n\nThe correct answer B suggests that the asteroid is at risk of rotational breakup. This is the most logical conclusion given the extremely fast rotation and the relatively small size of the asteroid, which implies it may not have sufficient internal strength to resist the centrifugal forces caused by such rapid rotation."}, "21": {"documentation": {"title": "From travelling waves to mild chaos: a supercritical bifurcation cascade\n  in pipe flow", "source": "Fernando Mellibovsky, Bruno Eckhardt", "docs_id": "1110.1222", "section": ["physics.flu-dyn", "nlin.CD"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "From travelling waves to mild chaos: a supercritical bifurcation cascade\n  in pipe flow.

Long-range correlations are found in symbolic sequences from human language, music and DNA.

The finding of Zipf's law for word frequencies in dolphin whistles has been the topic of an intense debate on its implications. One of the major arguments against the relevance of Zipf's law in dolphin whistles is that is not possible to distinguish the outcome of a die rolling experiment from that of a linguistic or communicative source producing Zipf's law for word frequencies.

Animal grouping behaviors have been widely studied due to their implications for understanding social intelligence, collective cognition, and potential applications in engineering, artificial intelligence, and robotics. An important biological aspect of these studies is discerning which selection pressures favor the evolution of grouping behavior. In the past decade, researchers have begun using evolutionary computation to study the evolutionary effects of these selection pressures in predator-prey models. The selfish herd hypothesis states that concentrated groups arise because prey selfishly attempt to place their conspecifics between themselves and the predator, thus causing an endless cycle of movement toward the center of the group. Using an evolutionary model of a predator-prey system, we show that how predators attack is critical to the evolution of the selfish herd.

Finally, we verify that density-dependent predation provides a sufficient selective advantage for prey to evolve the selfish herd in response to predation by coevolving predators.

To generate more natural speech signals with the constraint of limited training data, we propose a speaker adaptation task with an effective variation of neural vocoding models. In the proposed method, a speaker-independent training method is applied to capture universal attributes embedded in multiple speakers, and the trained model is then optimized to represent the specific characteristics of the target speaker. Experimental results verify that the proposed TTS systems with speaker-adaptive neural vocoders outperform those with traditional source-filter model-based vocoders and those with WaveNet vocoders, trained either speaker-dependently or speaker-independently.
