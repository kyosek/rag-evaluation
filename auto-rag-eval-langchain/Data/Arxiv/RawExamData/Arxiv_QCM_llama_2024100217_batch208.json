First, we explain the emergence of Kadomsev-Petviashvily (KP) $\\tau$-functions. This result is an extension of what we did in arXiv:1805.02761, where a symbolic correspondence between KP equations and group factors was established. In this paper we prove that integrability of the colored Alexander polynomial is due to it's relation to soliton $\\tau$-functions. Mainly, the colored Alexander polynomial is embedded in the action of the KP generating function on the soliton $\\tau$-function. Secondly, we use this correspondence to provide a rather simple combinatoric description of the group factors in term of Young diagrams, which is otherwise described in terms of chord diagrams, where no simple description is known.
