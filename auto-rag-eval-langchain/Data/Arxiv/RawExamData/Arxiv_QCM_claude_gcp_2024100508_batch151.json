A gene's rate of sequence evolution is among the most fundamental evolutionary quantities in common use, but what determines evolutionary rates has remained unclear. Here, we show that the two most commonly used methods to disentangle the determinants of evolutionary rate, partial correlation analysis and ordinary multivariate regression, produce misleading or spurious results when applied to noisy biological data. To overcome these difficulties, we employ an alternative method, principal component regression, which is a multivariate regression of evolutionary rate against the principal components of the predictor variables. We carry out the first combined analysis of seven predictors (gene expression level, dispensability, protein abundance, codon adaptation index, gene length, number of protein-protein interactions, and the gene's centrality in the interaction network). Strikingly, our analysis reveals a single dominant component which explains 40-fold more variation in evolutionary rate than any other, suggesting that protein evolutionary rate has a single determinant among the seven predictors. The dominant component explains nearly half the variation in the rate of synonymous and protein evolution. Our results support the hypothesis that selection against the cost of translation-error-induced protein misfolding governs the rate of synonymous and protein sequence evolution in yeast."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key finding and methodology of the study on yeast protein evolution rates?\n\nA) Partial correlation analysis revealed that gene expression level is the primary determinant of protein evolution rate in yeast.\n\nB) Ordinary multivariate regression identified seven equally important predictors of yeast protein evolution rate.\n\nC) Principal component regression uncovered a single dominant component explaining nearly half the variation in synonymous and protein evolution rates, supporting the translation-error-induced protein misfolding hypothesis.\n\nD) The study found that the number of protein-protein interactions is the most significant factor in determining yeast protein evolution rates.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

A powerful portmanteau test of lack of fit for time series. J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 97, 601-610.] may not exist and their asymptotic distribution of the test does not agree with the suggested gamma approximation very well if the number of lags used by the test is small. It is shown that the convergence of this test statistic to its asymptotic distribution may be quite slow when the series length is less than 1000 and so a Monte-Carlo test is recommended. Simulation experiments suggest the Monte-Carlo test is usually more powerful than the test given by Pena and Rodriguez [2002. A powerful portmanteau test of lack of fit for time series. J. Amer.

The study identifies several problems with the original Pena-Rodriguez test, including cases where the test statistic may not exist, poor agreement between the asymptotic distribution and the gamma approximation for small lag numbers, and slow convergence to the asymptotic distribution for series lengths less than 1000.

Managing morning commute traffic through parking provision management has been well studied in the literature.

However, in recent years, due to technological advancements and low market entry barrier, more and more e-dispatch FHVs (eFHVs) are provided in service. The rapidly growing eFHVs, on one hand, supply substantial trip services and complete the trips requiring no parking demand; on the other hand, imposes congestion effects to all road users. In this study, we investigate the multi-modal morning commute problem with bottleneck congestion and parking space constraints in the presence of ride-sourcing and transit service.

The problem of estimating sparse eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix attracts a lot of attention in many applications, especially those with high dimensional data set. While classical eigenvectors can be obtained as the solution of a maximization problem, existing approaches formulate this problem by adding a penalty term into the objective function that encourages a sparse solution. However, the resulting methods achieve sparsity at the expense of sacrificing the orthogonality property. In this paper, we develop a new method to estimate dominant sparse eigenvectors without trading off their orthogonality. The problem is highly non-convex and hard to handle. We apply the MM framework where we iteratively maximize a tight lower bound (surrogate function) of the objective function over the Stiefel manifold. The inner maximization problem turns out to be a rectangular Procrustes problem, which has a closed form solution.
