We describe a technique to reveal speed-of-sound (SoS) variations within an echogenic sample. The technique uses the same receive data as standard pulse-echo imaging based on plane-wave compounding, and can be operated in parallel. Point-like scatterers randomly distributed throughout the sample serve as local probes of the downstream transmit-beam phase shifts caused by aberrating structures within the sample. Phase shifts are monitored in a differential manner, providing signatures of transverse gradients of the local sample SoS. The contrast of the signatures is augmented by a method of angular compounding, which provides ``focus\" control of the image sharpness, which, in turn, enables a visual localization of aberrating inclusions within the sample on the fly. The localization can be performed in 2D when operated with standard B-mode imaging, or in 3D when operated with C-mode imaging. Finally, we present a wave-acoustic forward model that provides insight into the principle of differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging, and roughly recapitulates experimental results obtained with an elastography phantom.

Clever field redefinitions at the level of fluctuations enable us to circumvent the problem of varying a square-root matrix appearing in the theory. This greatly simplifies the expressions for the linear variation of the bimetric interaction terms. We show that these field redefinitions exist and are uniquely invertible if and only if the variation of the square-root matrix itself has a unique solution, which is a requirement for the linearised theory to be well-defined. As an application of our results we examine the constraint structure of ghost-free bimetric theory at the level of linear equations of motion for the first time. We identify a scalar combination of equations which is responsible for the absence of the Boulware-Deser ghost mode in the theory. The bimetric scalar constraint is in general not manifestly covariant in its nature. However, in the massive gravity limit the constraint assumes a covariant form when one of the interaction parameters is set to zero. For that case our analysis provides an alternative and almost trivial proof of the absence of the Boulware-Deser ghost.
