Krypton-85 is an anthropogenic beta-decaying isotope which produces low energy backgrounds in dark matter and neutrino experiments, especially those based upon liquid xenon. Several technologies have been developed to reduce the Kr concentration in such experiments. We propose to augment those separation technologies by first adding to the xenon an 85Kr-free sample of krypton in an amount much larger than the natural krypton that is already present. After the purification system reduces the total Kr concentration to the same level, the final 85Kr concentration will have been reduced even further by the dilution factor. A test cell for measurement of the activity of various Kr samples has been assembled, and the activity of 25-year-old Krypton has been measured. The measured activity agrees well with the expected activity accounting for the 85Kr abundance of the earth atmosphere in 1990 and the half-life of the isotope.

The krypton from 1944 (before the atomic era) would be essentially free of 85Kr, which is an anthropogenic isotope. \n\nIf this 85Kr-free krypton is added in an amount 10 times greater than the natural krypton already present, it will dilute the 85Kr by a factor of 11 (1 part original krypton with 85Kr + 10 parts 85Kr-free krypton). \n\nAfter purification to reduce the total krypton concentration to the original level, the 85Kr concentration will remain diluted by this factor. Therefore, the final 85Kr concentration will be approximately 1/11 of the original concentration, which is closest to the given option of 1/10.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the dilution principle, the nature of anthropogenic isotopes, and the ability to apply quantitative reasoning to a complex scenario."}, "32": {"documentation": {"title": "Opinion Dynamics with Conflicting Interests", "source": "Patrick Mellacher", "docs_id": "2111.09408", "section": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Opinion Dynamics with Conflicting Interests.

These results are derived by assuming a flat Lambda-CDM Universe, and by marginalizing over other free parameters and fixing the spectral index n=1 and the optical depth due to reionization tau=0.
