In a previous publication we put the idea forward that the missing stars are deeply connected to the presence of this disc. The progenitor of the stellar disc is very likely to have been a gaseous disc that at some point fragmented and triggered star formation. This caused the appearance of overdensity regions in the disc that had high enough densities to ensure stripping large giants of their atmospheres and thus rendering them very faint. In this paper we use a stellar evolution code to derive the properties that a red giant would display in a colour-magnitude diagram, as well as a non-linearity factor required for a correct estimate of the mass loss. We find that in a very short timescale, the red giants (RGs) leave their standard evolutionary track. The non-linearity factor has values that not only depend on the properties of the clumps, but also on the physical conditions the giant stars, as we predicted analytically.

We consider the process of bidding by electricity suppliers in a day-ahead market context where each supplier bids a linear non-decreasing function of her generating capacity with the goal of maximizing her individual profit given other competing suppliers' bids. Based on the submitted bids, the market operator schedules suppliers to meet demand during each hour and determines hourly market clearing prices. Eventually, this game-theoretic process reaches a Nash equilibrium when no supplier is motivated to modify her bid. However, solving the individual profit maximization problem requires information of rivals' bids, which are typically not available. To address this issue, we develop an inverse optimization approach for estimating rivals' production cost functions given historical market clearing prices and production levels. We then use these functions to bid strategically and compute Nash equilibrium bids.
