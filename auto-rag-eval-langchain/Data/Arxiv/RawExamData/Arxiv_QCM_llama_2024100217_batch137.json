Physical reservoir computing is a type of recurrent neural network that applies the dynamical response from physical systems to information processing. However, the relation between computation performance and physical parameters/phenomena still remains unclear. This study reports our progress regarding the role of current-dependent magnetic damping in the computational performance of reservoir computing. The current-dependent relaxation dynamics of a magnetic vortex core results in an asymmetric memory function with respect to binary inputs. A fast relaxation caused by a large input leads to a fast fading of the input memory, whereas a slow relaxation by a small input enables the reservoir to keep the input memory for a relatively long time. As a result, a step-like dependence is found for the short-term memory and parity-check capacities on the pulse width of input data, where the capacities remain at 1.5 for a certain range of the pulse width, and drop to 1.0 for a long pulse-width limit. Both analytical and numerical analyses clarify that the step-like behavior can be attributed to the current-dependent relaxation time of the vortex core to a limit-cycle state. }"}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the underlying physical phenomenon responsible for the step-like dependence of the memory function on pulse width in spintronics reservoir computing?\n\nA) The current-dependent magnetic damping causes a uniform relaxation dynamics, leading to a symmetric memory function.\nB) The current-dependent relaxation dynamics of a magnetic vortex core results in an asymmetric memory function with respect to binary inputs.\nC) The pulse width of input data determines the amplitude of the magnetic field, which in turn affects the memory function.\nD) The relaxation time of the vortex core is directly proportional to the pulse width of input data.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) The current-dependent relaxation dynamics of a magnetic vortex core results in an asymmetric memory function with respect to binary inputs.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is based on the analysis of the documentation, which states that the current-dependent relaxation dynamics of a magnetic vortex core results in an asymmetric memory function with respect to binary inputs.

To this end, we construct and analyze two two-dimensional deterministic fluid models that incorporate customer choice behavior based on delayed queue length information.

Fast moving classical variables can generate quantum mechanical behavior. We demonstrate how this can happen in a model. The key point is that in classically (ontologically) evolving systems one can still define a conserved quantum energy. For the fast variables, the energy levels are far separated, such that one may assume these variables to stay in their ground state. This forces them to be entangled, so that, consequently, the slow variables are entangled as well. The fast variables could be the vacuum fluctuations caused by unknown super heavy particles. The emerging quantum effects in the light particles are expressed by a Hamiltonian that can have almost any form. The entire system is ontological, and yet allows one to generate interference effects in computer models. This seemed to lead to an unsolvable paradox, which is now resolved: exactly what happens in our models if we run a quantum interference experiment in a classical computer is explained. The restriction that very fast variables stay predominantly in their ground state appears to be due to smearing of the physical states in the time direction, preventing their direct detection.

This forces them to be entangled, which in turn entangles the slow variables.

We hypothesized that compliant exoskeleton knees could decrease required effort to maneuver on uneven terrain, and increase gait velocity and stability. We describe a case study of a motor-complete spinal cord injury user (AIS A, Th12) walking with a powered exoskeleton on even and uneven ground over multiple sessions after extensive training. Measurements with compliant or rigid exoskeleton knee joints were performed on three different days for each configuration. Body motion and crutch ground interaction forces were recorded to assess gait performance. We observed higher walking speeds with a compliant exoskeleton knee configuration (mean: 0.116 m/s on uneven and 0.145 m/s on even ground) compared to a rigid configuration (mean: 0.083 m/s and 0.100 m/s). Crutch force impulse was significantly reduced in the compliant configuration. Lastly, gait was more symmetric when the knee joints were compliant.
