However, before carrying out refactoring activities, developers need to identify refactoring opportunities. Currently, refactoring opportunity identification heavily relies on developers' expertise and intuition. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting software refactorings.

It is then assumed that the associated probability measure can only be used (e.g. sampled) under a discretized approximation. In such scenarios, it is known that to achieve a target error, the computational effort can be reduced when using MLMC relative to exact sampling from the most accurate discretized probability. The ideas rely upon introducing hierarchies of the discretizations where less accurate approximations cost less to compute, and using an appropriate collapsing sum expression for the target expectation. If a suitable coupling of the probability measures in the hierarchy is achieved, then a reduction in cost is possible.

Consider an Internet-of-Things (IoT) system that monitors a number of multi-valued events through multiple sensors sharing the same bandwidth. Each sensor measures data correlated to one or more events, and communicates to the fusion center at a base station using grant-free random access whenever the corresponding event is active. The base station aims at detecting the active events, and, for each active event, to determine a scalar value describing each active event's state. A conventional solution based on Separate Source-Channel (SSC) coding would use a separate codebook for each sensor and decode the sensors' transmitted packets at the base station in order to subsequently carry out events' detection. In contrast, this paper considers a potentially more efficient solution based on Joint Source-Channel (JSC) coding via a non-orthogonal generalization of Type-Based Multiple Access (TBMA). Accordingly, all sensors measuring the same event share the same codebook (with non-orthogonal codewords), and the base station directly detects the events' values without first performing individual decoding for each sensor. A novel Bayesian message-passing detection scheme is developed for the proposed TBMA-based protocol, and its performance is compared to conventional solutions."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the context of the Joint Source-Channel Coding and Bayesian Message Passing Detection for Grant-Free Radio Access in IoT, what is the primary advantage of using a Joint Source-Channel (JSC) coding approach over a Separate Source-Channel (SSC) coding approach in a multi-sensor IoT system?\n\n**A)** JSC coding allows for more efficient use of bandwidth, as all sensors share the same codebook.\n**B)** JSC coding enables the base station to detect events' values without individual decoding for each sensor, reducing computational complexity.\n**C)** JSC coding provides better error correction capabilities, as non-orthogonal codewords can be used to detect multiple events simultaneously.\n**D)** JSC coding enables the use of multiple codebooks for each sensor, allowing for more flexible event detection.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) JSC coding enables the base station to detect events' values without individual decoding for each sensor, reducing computational complexity.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is B) JSC coding enables the base station to detect events' values without individual decoding for each sensor, reducing computational complexity.
