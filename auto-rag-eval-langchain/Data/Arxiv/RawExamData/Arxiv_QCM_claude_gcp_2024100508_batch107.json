Recent advances in machine learning, especially techniques such as deep neural networks, are enabling a range of emerging applications. One such example is autonomous driving, which often relies on deep learning for perception. However, deep learning-based perception has been shown to be vulnerable to a host of subtle adversarial manipulations of images. Nevertheless, the vast majority of such demonstrations focus on perception that is disembodied from end-to-end control. We present novel end-to-end attacks on autonomous driving in simulation, using simple physically realizable attacks: the painting of black lines on the road. These attacks target deep neural network models for end-to-end autonomous driving control. A systematic investigation shows that such attacks are easy to engineer, and we describe scenarios (e.g., right turns) in which they are highly effective. We define several objective functions that quantify the success of an attack and develop techniques based on Bayesian Optimization to efficiently traverse the search space of higher dimensional attacks. Additionally, we define a novel class of hijacking attacks, where painted lines on the road cause the driver-less car to follow a target path. Through the use of network deconvolution, we provide insights into the successful attacks, which appear to work by mimicking activations of entirely different scenarios.

The method not only reveals the existence or absence of a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) error floor (phase transition) but also provides insight into the MMSE decay via multivariate generalizations of the MMSE dimension and the MMSE power offset, which are a function of the interaction between the geometrical properties of the kernel and the Gaussian mixture.

Recently, there has been rapid and significant progress on image dehazing. Many deep learning based methods have shown their superb performance in handling homogeneous dehazing problems. However, we observe that even if a carefully designed convolutional neural network (CNN) can perform well on large-scaled dehazing benchmarks, the network usually fails on the non-homogeneous dehazing datasets introduced by NTIRE challenges. The reasons are mainly in two folds. Firstly, due to its non-homogeneous nature, the non-uniformly distributed haze is harder to be removed than the homogeneous haze. Secondly, the research challenge only provides limited data (there are only 25 training pairs in NH-Haze 2021 dataset). Thus, learning the mapping from the domain of hazy images to that of clear ones based on very limited data is extremely hard.

This article discusses the relationship between emergence and reductionism from the perspective of a condensed matter physicist. Reductionism and emergence play an intertwined role in the everyday life of the physicist, yet we rarely stop to contemplate their relationship: indeed, the two are often regarded as conflicting world-views of science. I argue that in practice, they compliment one-another, forming an awkward alliance in a fashion envisioned by the Renaissance scientist, Francis Bacon. Looking at the historical record in classical and quantum physics, I discuss how emergence fits into a reductionist view of nature. Often, a deep understanding of reductionist physics depends on the understanding of its emergent consequences. Thus the concept of energy was unknown to Newton, Leibnitz, Lagrange or Hamilton, because they did not understand heat. Similarly, the understanding of the weak force awaited an understanding of the Meissner effect in superconductivity. Emergence can thus be likened to an encrypted consequence of reductionism. Taking examples from current research, including topological insulators and strange metals, I show that the convection between emergence and reductionism continues to provide a powerful driver for frontier scientific research, linking the lab with the cosmos."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the relationship between emergence and reductionism in physics, which of the following statements best exemplifies the \"awkward Baconian alliance\" described in the article?\n\nA) Emergence and reductionism are fundamentally incompatible approaches to understanding nature, and physicists must choose one or the other.\n\nB) The concept of energy was developed independently of reductionist physics and later integrated into Newton's laws of motion.\n\nC) Understanding of the weak force in particle physics was a prerequisite for explaining the Meissner effect in superconductivity.\n\nD) The discovery of emergent phenomena often leads to a deeper understanding of fundamental physical principles, which in turn informs reductionist approaches.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because it captures the essence of the \"awkward Baconian alliance\" described in the article. The article argues that emergence and reductionism complement each other, rather than being conflicting worldviews. It provides examples where understanding emergent phenomena (like heat) led to deeper insights into fundamental concepts (like energy), and where emergent effects in one field (superconductivity) helped explain fundamental forces (weak force) in another.

A geometric analysis of protein folding, which complements many of the models in the literature, is presented. We examine the process from unfolded strand to the point where the strand becomes self-interacting. A central question is how it is possible that so many initial configurations proceed to fold to a unique final configuration. We put energy and dynamical considerations temporarily aside and focus upon the geometry alone. We parameterize the structure of an idealized protein using the concept of a ribbon from differential geometry. The deformation of the ribbon is described by introducing a generic twisting Ansatz. The folding process in this picture entails a change in shape guided by the local amino acid geometry. The theory is reparamaterization invariant from the start, so the final shape is independent of folding time. We develop differential equations for the changing shape. For some parameter ranges, a sine-Gordon torsion soliton is found. This purely geometric waveform has properties similar to dynamical solitons. Namely: A threshold distortion of the molecule is required to initiate the soliton, after which, small additional distortions do not change the waveform. In this analysis, the soliton twists the molecule until bonds form.

Therefore, it would take 2 times longer to achieve the same displacement for an asteroid with a 200 m diameter compared to one with a 50 m diameter.
