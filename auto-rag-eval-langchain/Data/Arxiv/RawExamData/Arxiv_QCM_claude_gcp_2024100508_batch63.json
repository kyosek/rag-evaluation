In this paper, we provide causal evidence on abortions and risky health behaviors as determinants of mental health development among young women. Using administrative in- and outpatient records from Sweden, we apply a novel grouped fixed-effects estimator proposed by Bonhomme and Manresa (2015) to allow for time-varying unobserved heterogeneity. We show that the positive association obtained from standard estimators shrinks to zero once we control for grouped time-varying unobserved heterogeneity. We estimate the group-specific profiles of unobserved heterogeneity, which reflect differences in unobserved risk to be diagnosed with a mental health condition. We then analyze mental health development and risky health behaviors other than unwanted pregnancies across groups. Our results suggest that these are determined by the same type of unobserved heterogeneity, which we attribute to the same unobserved process of decision-making. We develop and estimate a theoretical model of risky choices and mental health, in which mental health disparity across groups is generated by different degrees of self-control problems. Our findings imply that mental health concerns cannot be used to justify restrictive abortion policies.

This suggests that the apparent relationship is not causal, but rather due to underlying factors that influence both the likelihood of having an abortion and experiencing mental health issues. The study concludes that mental health concerns cannot be used to justify restrictive abortion policies, as the direct link between abortions and mental health problems is not supported by their findings when properly accounting for unobserved heterogeneity."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "Effect of ion hydration on the first-order transition in the sequential\n  wetting of hexane on brine", "source": "Volker C.

In recent experiments, a sequence of changes in the wetting state (`wetting transitions') has been observed upon increasing the temperature in systems consisting of pentane on pure water and of hexane on brine. This sequence of two transitions is brought about by an interplay of short-range and long-range interactions between substrate and adsorbate. In this work, we argue that the short-range interaction (contact energy) between hexane and pure water remains unchanged due to the formation of a depletion layer (a thin `layer' of pure water which is completely devoid of ions) at the surface of the electrolyte and that the presence of the salt manifests itself only in a modification of the long-range interaction between substrate and adsorbate.

The documentation states that the short-range interaction (contact energy) between hexane and pure water remains unchanged due to the formation of a depletion layer at the surface of the electrolyte.

A key issue in exploiting spatial caching diversity is that the cached content may not be located at the nearest BS, which means that to access such content, a user needs to overcome strong interference from the nearby BSs; this significantly limits the gain of spatial caching diversity. In this paper, we consider a joint design of frequency reuse and caching, such that the benefit of an improved cache hit probability induced by spatial caching diversity and the benefit of interference coordination induced by frequency reuse can be achieved simultaneously.

Through the transition, a separation vortex disappears and a jet flow induced close to the wall by the viscoelasticity moves into the bulk; The viscous drag significantly drops and the elastic wall friction rises sharply. This transition is caused by an elastic force in the streamwise direction due to the competition of the convective and elastic effects. In the transition region, the convective and elastic effects balance. When the elastic effect dominates the convective effect, the second transition occurs but it is relatively moderate. The second one seems to be governed by so-called Weissenberg effect. These transitions are not sensitive to driving forces. By the scaling analysis, it is shown that the stress component is proportional to the Reynolds number on the boundary of the first transition in the Re-Wi space. This scaling coincides well with the numerical result."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the study of flow pattern transitions in two-dimensional curvilinear viscoelastic flows, which of the following statements accurately describes the first transition between the \"convective\" and \"transition\" regions as the Weissenberg number (Wi) increases?\n\nA) The viscous drag increases significantly while the elastic wall friction decreases sharply.\n\nB) A separation vortex forms and a jet flow moves from the bulk towards the wall.\n\nC) The elastic effect becomes suddenly comparable to the convective effect, and a jet flow induced close to the wall moves into the bulk.\n\nD) The transition is primarily governed by the Weissenberg effect and is highly sensitive to driving forces.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

During this transition, a separation vortex disappears and a jet flow induced close to the wall by viscoelasticity moves into the bulk. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it states the opposite of what happens; the viscous drag actually drops significantly while the elastic wall friction rises sharply during the transition.\n\nOption B is incorrect as it describes the reverse of the actual process. The separation vortex disappears rather than forms, and the jet flow moves from near the wall into the bulk, not the other way around.\n\nOption D is incorrect for two reasons.

The standard Q criterion (with Q > 1) describes the local stability of a disc supported by rotation and random motion. Most astrophysical discs, however, are under the influence of an external gravitational field which can affect their stability. A typical example is a galactic disc embedded in a dark matter halo. Here we do a linear perturbation analysis for a disc in an external field, and obtain a generalized dispersion relation and a modified stability criterion. An external field has two effects on the disc dynamics: first, it contributes to the unperturbed rotational field, and second, it adds a tidal field term in the stability parameter. A typical disruptive tidal field results in a higher modified Q value and hence leads to a more stable disc. We apply these results to the Milky Way, and to a low surface brightness galaxy UGC 7321. We find that in each case the stellar disc by itself is barely stable and it is the dark matter halo that stabilizes the disc against local, axisymmetric gravitational instabilities.

A longstanding goal in the theory of deep learning is to characterize the conditions under which a given neural network architecture will be trainable, and if so, how well it might generalize to unseen data. In this work, we provide such a characterization in the limit of very wide and very deep networks, for which the analysis simplifies considerably. For wide networks, the trajectory under gradient descent is governed by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), and for deep networks the NTK itself maintains only weak data dependence. By analyzing the spectrum of the NTK, we formulate necessary conditions for trainability and generalization across a range of architectures, including Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We identify large regions of hyperparameter space for which networks can memorize the training set but completely fail to generalize. We find that CNNs without global average pooling behave almost identically to FCNs, but that CNNs with pooling have markedly different and often better generalization performance.

Starting with conformally covariant correlation functions, a sequence of functional representations of the conformal algebra is constructed. A key step is the introduction of representations which involve an auxiliary functional.

In a particular representation, the former corresponds to the canonical form of the Exact Renormalization Group equation specialized to a fixed-point whereas the latter is new. This provides a concrete understanding of how conformal invariance is realized as a property of the Wilsonian effective action and the relationship to action-free formulations of conformal field theory. Subsequently, it is argued that the conformal Ward Identities serve to define a particular representation of the energy-momentum tensor.
