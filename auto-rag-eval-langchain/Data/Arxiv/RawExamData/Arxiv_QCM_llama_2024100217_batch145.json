The performance of on-chip communication in the state-of-the-art multi-core processors that use the traditional electron-ic NoCs has already become severely energy-constrained. To that end, emerging photonic NoCs (PNoC) are seen as a po-tential solution to improve the energy-efficiency (performance per watt) of on-chip communication. However, existing PNoC designs cannot realize their full potential due to their exces-sive laser power consumption. Prior works that attempt to improve laser power efficiency in PNoCs do not consider all key factors that affect the laser power requirement of PNoCs. Therefore, they cannot yield the desired balance between the reduction in laser power, achieved performance and energy-efficiency in PNoCs. In this paper, we present PROTEUS framework that employs rule-based self-adaptation in PNoCs. Our approach not only reduces the laser power consumption, but also minimizes the average packet latency by opportunis-tically increasing the communication data rate in PNoCs, and thus, yields the desired balance between the laser power re-duction, performance, and energy-efficiency in PNoCs. Our evaluation with PARSEC benchmarks shows that our PROTEUS framework can achieve up to 24.5% less laser power consumption, up to 31% less average packet latency, and up to 20% less energy-per-bit, compared to another laser power management technique from prior work."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the primary motivation behind the development of the PROTEUS framework, and how does it address the limitations of existing photonic NoCs (PNoCs)?\n\nA) To improve the scalability of PNoCs for large-scale data centers, while minimizing laser power consumption and packet latency.\nB) To optimize the performance of PNoCs for real-time applications, by reducing laser power consumption and increasing data rates.\nC) To enhance the energy-efficiency of PNoCs for mobile devices, by minimizing laser power consumption and packet latency.\nD) To realize the full potential of PNoCs for high-performance computing, by reducing laser power consumption, minimizing packet latency, and improving energy-efficiency.\n\nCorrect Answer: D) To realize the full potential of PNoCs for high-performance computing, by reducing laser power consumption, minimizing packet latency, and improving energy-efficiency.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D) because the PROTEUS framework is designed to address the limitations of existing PNoCs, which are energy-constrained and cannot realize their full potential due to excessive laser power consumption.

The encoder is subject to a rate constraint of R bits per symbol, and the decoder observes side information consisting of an uncompressed source symbol subject to slow fading and noise. The fading probability density function is continuous and quasiconcave, such as Rayleigh or Rician. The side-information channel has two discrete fading states, and the encoder knows only the distribution of the source.\n\n**A)** The optimal single-layer rate allocation is to target the least favorable state as if the side information was absent, and the rate should be allocated to minimize the expected distortion.\n\n**B)** The optimal single-layer rate allocation is to target the most favorable state as if the side information was absent, and the rate should be allocated to minimize the expected distortion.\n\n**C)** The optimal single-layer rate allocation is to target a weighted average of the two fading states, and the rate should be allocated to minimize the expected distortion.\n\n**D)** The optimal single-layer rate allocation is to target a single fading state, and the rate should be allocated to minimize the expected distortion.\n\n**Correct Answer:** A) The optimal single-layer rate allocation is to target the least favorable state as if the side information was absent, and the rate should be allocated to minimize the expected distortion.\n\n**Explanation:** According to the documentation, when the fading probability density function is continuous and quasiconcave, the optimal single-layer rate allocation is to target the least favorable state as if the side information was absent. This is because the decoder can use the side information to correct for the distortion, and targeting the least favorable state minimizes the expected distortion. The rate should be allocated to minimize the expected distortion, which is achieved by targeting the least favorable state."}, "53": {"documentation": {"title": "What's in a crowd?

Analysis of face-to-face behavioral networks. The availability of new data sources on human mobility is opening new avenues for investigating the interplay of social networks, human mobility and dynamical processes such as epidemic spreading. Here we analyze data on the time-resolved face-to-face proximity of individuals in large-scale real-world scenarios. We compare two settings with very different properties, a scientific conference and a long-running museum exhibition. We track the behavioral networks of face-to-face proximity, and characterize them from both a static and a dynamic point of view, exposing important differences as well as striking similarities. We use our data to investigate the dynamics of a susceptible-infected model for epidemic spreading that unfolds on the dynamical networks of human proximity. The spreading patterns are markedly different for the conference and the museum case, and they are strongly impacted by the causal structure of the network data. A deeper study of the spreading paths shows that the mere knowledge of static aggregated networks would lead to erroneous conclusions about the transmission paths on the dynamical networks."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat are the key differences in the spreading patterns of epidemic disease between a scientific conference and a long-running museum exhibition, as inferred from the analysis of face-to-face behavioral networks?\n\nA) The conference setting exhibits more static and homogeneous networks, leading to slower spreading rates, whereas the museum setting displays more dynamic and heterogeneous networks, resulting in faster spreading rates.\n\nB) The conference setting shows more localized and contained outbreaks, whereas the museum setting exhibits more widespread and interconnected outbreaks.\n\nC) The conference setting has a more centralized causal structure, leading to more targeted interventions, whereas the museum setting has a more decentralized causal structure, resulting in more widespread transmission.\n\nD) The conference setting displays more aggregated and static networks, whereas the museum setting exhibits more dynamic and interconnected networks.\n\nCorrect Answer: B) The conference setting shows more localized and contained outbreaks, whereas the museum setting exhibits more widespread and interconnected outbreaks.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is based on the analysis of the face-to-face behavioral networks in the two settings.

Semiconductor detectors in general have a dead layer at their surfaces that is either a result of natural or induced passivation, or is formed during the process of making a contact.

We have constructed a detailed Monte Carlo model for the passage of electrons from vacuum into a silicon detector, and compared the measured energy spectra to the predicted ones for a range of energies from 12 to 20 keV. The comparison provides experimental evidence that a substantial fraction of the ionization produced in the \"dead\" layer evidently escapes by diffusion, with 46% being collected in the depletion zone and the balance being neutralized at the contact or by bulk recombination.
