Most programming languages were designed before the age of web. This matters because the web changes many assumptions that typed functional language designers take for granted. For example, programs do not run in a closed world, but must instead interact with (changing and likely unreliable) services and data sources, communication is often asynchronous or event-driven, and programs need to interoperate with untyped environments. In this paper, we present how the F# language and libraries face the challenges posed by the web. Technically, this comprises using type providers for integration with external information sources and for integration with untyped programming environments, using lightweight meta-programming for targeting JavaScript and computation expressions for writing asynchronous code. In this inquiry, the holistic perspective is more important than each of the features in isolation. We use a practical case study as a starting point and look at how F# language and libraries approach the challenges posed by the web.

In the absence of a carefully designed control law, such direct feedback between the two layers could increase volatility and lower the system's robustness to uncertainty in demand and generation.

The core of the MGHG-INT is what we call the IHDI-adjusted Gross Domestic Product (IDHIGDP), based on the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI). The IDHIGDP makes it possible to propose universal measures, such as MGHG-INT. We also propose a carbon border tax applicable at national borders, based on MGHG-INT and IDHIGDP. This carbon tax is supported by a proposed global Emissions Trading System (ETS). The proposed carbon tax is analyzed in a short-term scenario, where it is shown that it can result in significant reduction in global emissions while keeping the economy growing at a positive rate. In addition to annual GHG emissions, cumulative GHG emissions over two decades are considered with almost the same results."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: The Modified Greenhouse Gas Intensity (MGHG-INT) measure proposed in the document is based on which of the following concepts, and what is its primary advantage?\n\nA) It's based on the standard Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its main advantage is simplicity in calculation.\n\nB) It's based on the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) and its main advantage is the ability to classify nations easily.\n\nC) It's based on the IHDI-adjusted Gross Domestic Product (IDHIGDP) and its main advantage is the elimination of the need to classify nations.\n\nD) It's based on cumulative GHG emissions over two decades and its main advantage is accurate long-term predictions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

To demonstrate the characteristics of the proposed framework, we determine the optimal strategy to economically justify the investment in residential PV-battery systems for additional grid supply during peak demand periods.

A DNA dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG) in water solution with the alkali metal counterions Na$^{+}$, K$^{+}$, and Cs$^{+}$ has been simulated. The systems have been considered in the regimes without excess salt and with different salts (0.5 M of NaCl, KCl or CsCl) added. The results have showed that the Na$^{+}$ counterions interact with the phosphate groups directly from outside of the double helix and via water molecules at the top edge of DNA minor groove. The potassium ions are mostly localized in the grooves of the double helix, and the cesium ions penetrate deeply inside the minor groove being bonded directly to the atoms of nucleic bases. Due to the electrostatic repulsion the chlorine ions tend to be localized at large distances from the DNA polyanion, but some Cl$^{-}$ anions have been detected near atomic groups of the double helix forming electrically neutral pairs with counterions already condensed on DNA. The DNA sites, where counterions are incorporated, are characterized by local changes of double helix structure. The lifetime of Na$^{+}$ and K$^{+}$ in complex with DNA atomic groups is less than 0.5 ns, while in the case of the cesium ions it may reach several nanoseconds. In this time scale, the Cs$^{+}$ counterions form a structured system of charges in the DNA minor groove that can be considered as ionic lattice."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately describes the behavior of different alkali metal counterions around DNA, as observed in the molecular dynamics study?\n\nA) Na+ ions primarily interact with the phosphate groups from inside the double helix and are found at the bottom of the major groove.\n\nB) K+ ions are mostly localized in the grooves of the double helix, while Cs+ ions form a structured system of charges in the DNA minor groove that can be considered as an ionic lattice.\n\nC) Cs+ ions interact weakly with the DNA structure and are primarily found in the solution away from the double helix.\n\nD) Na+ ions have the longest lifetime in complex with DNA atomic groups, lasting several nanoseconds compared to K+ and Cs+ ions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it accurately combines two key findings from the study. First, it correctly states that K+ ions are mostly localized in the grooves of the double helix. Second, it accurately describes the behavior of Cs+ ions, which form a structured system of charges in the DNA minor groove that can be considered as an ionic lattice.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it misrepresents the behavior of Na+ ions. The study shows that Na+ ions interact with phosphate groups from outside the double helix, not inside, and they interact via water molecules at the top edge of the minor groove, not the bottom of the major groove.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it contradicts the findings about Cs+ ions. The study shows that Cs+ ions penetrate deeply inside the minor groove and bond directly to the atoms of nucleic bases, rather than staying away from the double helix.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it reverses the lifetime findings. The study states that Na+ and K+ ions have shorter lifetimes in complex with DNA atomic groups (less than 0.5 ns), while Cs+ ions can have lifetimes of several nanoseconds.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to integrate multiple pieces of information from the study and distinguish between the behaviors of different counterions."}, "44": {"documentation": {"title": "SepNE: Bringing Separability to Network Embedding", "source": "Ziyao Li and Liang Zhang and Guojie Song", "docs_id": "1811.05614", "section": ["cs.LG", "cs.SI", "stat.ML"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "SepNE: Bringing Separability to Network Embedding. Many successful methods have been proposed for learning low dimensional representations on large-scale networks, while almost all existing methods are designed in inseparable processes, learning embeddings for entire networks even when only a small proportion of nodes are of interest.

In this paper, we formalize the problem of separated matrix factorization, based on which we elaborate a novel objective function that preserves both local and global information. We further propose SepNE, a simple and flexible network embedding algorithm which independently learns representations for different subsets of nodes in separated processes. By implementing separability, our algorithm reduces the redundant efforts to embed irrelevant nodes, yielding scalability to super-large networks, automatic implementation in distributed learning and further adaptations.

The parameters of the model at the nucleon-nucleon-meson vertices are determined by fitting the elastic nucleon-nucleon scattering with an effective interaction based on the exchange of these four mesons, while those at the resonance vertices are calculated from the known decay widths of the resonances and from the vector meson dominance model. Experimental data taken recently by the COSY-11 collaboration are described well by this approach. The one-pion-exchange diagram dominates the production process at both higher and lower beam energies. The excitation of the N*(1650) resonance dominates both the production channels at near threshold energies. Our model with final state interaction effects among the outgoing particles included within the Watson-Migdal approximation, is able to explain the observed beam energy dependence of the ratio of the total cross sections of these two reactions."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the effective Lagrangian model described for investigating strangeness production in near-threshold nucleon-nucleon collisions, which of the following combinations correctly represents the key elements of the model?\n\nA) Exchange of pi, rho, omega, and sigma mesons for initial nucleon-nucleon interaction; excitation of N*(1650), N*(1710), and N*(1720) resonances for strangeness production; Watson-Migdal approximation for final state interactions\n\nB) Exchange of pi, eta, kaon, and sigma mesons for initial nucleon-nucleon interaction; excitation of Delta(1232), N*(1535), and N*(1650) resonances for strangeness production; Lippmann-Schwinger equation for final state interactions\n\nC) Exchange of pi, rho, omega, and phi mesons for initial nucleon-nucleon interaction; excitation of N*(1535), N*(1650), and N*(1720) resonances for strangeness production; Glauber model for final state interactions\n\nD) Exchange of pi, rho, eta, and sigma mesons for initial nucleon-nucleon interaction; excitation of N*(1440), N*(1520), and N*(1650) resonances for strangeness production; optical potential model for final state interactions\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A because it accurately reflects the key elements of the model described in the documentation.
