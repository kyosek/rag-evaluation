We propose a reduced form set of two coupled continuous time equations linking the price of a representative asset and the price of a bond, the later quantifying the cost of borrowing. The feedbacks between asset prices and bonds are mediated by the dependence of their \"fundamental values\" on past asset prices and bond themselves. The obtained nonlinear self-referencing price dynamics can induce, in a completely objective deterministic way, the appearance of periodically exploding bubbles ending in crashes. Technically, the periodically explosive bubbles arise due to the proximity of two types of bifurcations as a function of the two key control parameters $b$ and $g$, which represent, respectively, the sensitivity of the fundamental asset price on past asset and bond prices and of the fundamental bond price on past asset prices. One is a Hopf bifurcation, when a stable focus transforms into an unstable focus and a limit cycle appears. The other is a rather unusual bifurcation, when a stable node and a saddle merge together and disappear, while an unstable focus survives and a limit cycle develops. The lines, where the periodic bubbles arise, are analogous to the critical lines of phase transitions in statistical physics.

Recent research has demonstrated the potential of using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in this context. However, most of the studies do not consider realistic settings that could seamlessly transition into deployment. In this paper, we propose a DRL-based adaptive traffic signal control framework that explicitly considers realistic traffic scenarios, sensors, and physical constraints. In this framework, we also propose a novel reward function that shows significantly improved traffic performance compared to the typical baseline pre-timed and fully-actuated traffic signals controllers.

In this paper, we critically review those constraints and find several caveats on the analysis. First of all, the constraints on the fraction $\\alpha$ of PBH in matter seem to be driven by a very restrictive choice of priors on the cosmological parameters. In particular, the degeneracy between $\\Omega_{\\rm M}$ and $\\alpha$ is ignored and thus, by fixing $\\Omega_{\\rm M}$, transferred the constraining power of SN magnitudes to $\\alpha$. Furthermore, by considering more realistic physical sizes for the type-Ia supernovae, we find an effect on the SN lensing magnification distribution that leads to significantly looser constraints. Moreover, considering a wide mass spectrum of PBH, such as a lognormal distribution, further softens the constraints from SN lensing. Finally, we find that the fraction of PBH that could constitute DM today is bounded by $f_{\\rm PBH} < 1.09\\ (1.38)$, for JLA (Union 2.1) catalogs, and thus it is perfectly compatible with an all-PBH dark matter scenario in the LIGO band."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nWhat is the primary conclusion regarding the constraints on massive primordial black holes (PBH) as a constituent of dark matter, as presented in the paper \"LIGO Lo(g)Normal MACHO: Primordial Black Holes survive SN lensing\"?\n\nA) The constraints on the fraction of PBH in matter are incompatible with present observations, ruling out an all-PBH dark matter scenario.\nB) The constraints on the fraction of PBH in matter are compatible with present observations, suggesting that an all-PBH dark matter scenario is possible.\nC) The constraints on the fraction of PBH in matter are driven by a restrictive choice of priors on cosmological parameters, but do not provide conclusive evidence for or against an all-PBH dark matter scenario.\nD) The constraints on the fraction of PBH in matter are significantly loosened when considering a wide mass spectrum of PBH, such as a lognormal distribution.\n\nCorrect Answer: C) The constraints on the fraction of PBH in matter are driven by a restrictive choice of priors on cosmological parameters, but do not provide conclusive evidence for or against an all-PBH dark matter scenario.\n\nExplanation: The paper critically reviews the constraints on PBH as a constituent of dark matter and finds that the constraints are driven by a restrictive choice of priors on cosmological parameters.

Thermal history of the Universe between inflation and big-bang nucleosynthesis has not yet been revealed observationally. It will be probed by the detection of primordial gravitational waves generated during inflation, which contain information on the reheating temperature as well as the equation of state of the Universe after inflation. Based on Fisher information formalism, we examine how accurately the tensor-to-scalar ratio and reheating temperature after inflation can be simultaneously determined with space-based gravitational wave detectors such as the DECI-hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (DECIGO) and the Big-Bang Observer (BBO). We show that the reheating temperature is best determined if it is around 10^7 GeV for tensor-to-scalar ratio of around 0.1, and explore the detectable parameter space. We also find that equation of state of the early Universe can be also determined accurately enough to distinguish different equation-of-state parameters if the inflationary gravitational waves are successfully detected.

Even before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bus ridership in the United States had attained its lowest level since 1973. If transit agencies hope to reverse this trend, they must understand how their service allocation policies affect ridership. This paper is among the first to model ridership trends on a hyper-local level over time. A Poisson fixed-effects model is developed to evaluate the ridership elasticity to frequency on weekdays using passenger count data from Portland, Miami, Minneapolis/St-Paul, and Atlanta between 2012 and 2018. In every agency, ridership is found to be elastic to frequency when observing the variation between individual route-segments at one point in time. In other words, the most frequent routes are already the most productive in terms of passengers per vehicle-trip. When observing the variation within each route-segment over time, however, ridership is inelastic; each additional vehicle-trip is expected to generate less ridership than the average bus already on the route. In three of the four agencies, the elasticity is a decreasing function of prior frequency, meaning that low-frequency routes are the most sensitive to changes in frequency.
