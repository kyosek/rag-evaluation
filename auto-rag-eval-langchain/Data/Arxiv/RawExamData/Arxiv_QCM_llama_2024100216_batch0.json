Many biological microswimmers locomote by periodically beating the densely-packed cilia on their cell surface in a wave-like fashion. While the swimming mechanisms of ciliated microswimmers have been extensively studied both from the analytical and the numerical point of view, the optimization of the ciliary motion of microswimmers has received limited attention, especially for non-spherical shapes. In this paper, using an envelope model for the microswimmer, we numerically optimize the ciliary motion of a ciliate with an arbitrary axisymmetric shape. The forward solutions are found using a fast boundary integral method, and the efficiency sensitivities are derived using an adjoint-based method. Our results show that a prolate microswimmer with a 2:1 aspect ratio shares similar optimal ciliary motion as the spherical microswimmer, yet the swimming efficiency can increase two-fold. More interestingly, the optimal ciliary motion of a concave microswimmer can be qualitatively different from that of the spherical microswimmer, and adding a constraint to the ciliary length is found to improve, on average, the efficiency for such swimmers."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the primary finding regarding the optimal ciliary motion of axisymmetric microswimmers, and how does it differ for prolate and concave microswimmers?\n\nA) The optimal ciliary motion for all microswimmers is a sinusoidal wave, with no differences between prolate and concave shapes.\nB) The optimal ciliary motion for prolate microswimmers is similar to that of spherical microswimmers, but with a two-fold increase in swimming efficiency.\nC) The optimal ciliary motion for concave microswimmers can be qualitatively different from that of spherical microswimmers, and adding a constraint to the ciliary length improves efficiency.\nD) The optimal ciliary motion for all microswimmers is a linear motion, with no differences between prolate and concave shapes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C) The optimal ciliary motion for concave"}, "58": {"documentation": {"title": "Possible origin of viscosity in the Keplerian accretion disks due to\n  secondary perturbation: Turbulent transport without magnetic field", "source": "Banibrata Mukhopadhyay, Kanak Saha", "docs_id": "1101.4613", "section": ["astro-ph.HE", "astro-ph.CO", "astro-ph.GA"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Possible origin of viscosity in the Keplerian accretion disks due to\n  secondary perturbation: Turbulent transport without magnetic field. The origin of hydrodynamic turbulence in rotating shear flow is a long standing puzzle. Resolving it is especially important in astrophysics when the flow angular momentum profile is Keplerian which forms an accretion disk having negligible molecular viscosity. Hence, any viscosity in such systems must be due to turbulence, arguably governed by magnetorotational instability especially when temperature T >~ 10^5. However, such disks around quiescent cataclysmic variables, protoplanetary and star-forming disks, the outer regions of disks in active galactic nuclei are practically neutral in charge because of their low temperature, and thus expected not to be coupled with the magnetic field appropriately to generate any transport due to the magnetorotational instability. This flow is similar to plane Couette flow including the Coriolis force, at least locally.
