Mining projects often gain support from communities through promises of benefits to the local economy, though the empirical evidence is mixed: mineral assets are advantageous in some circumstances but lead to corruption and violence in others. To shed light on this apparent discrepancy, we significantly extend the coverage of previous work in this area by gathering satellite data that spans several decades and encompasses several institutional environments. Our dataset consists of one million 30m-resolution Landsat images between 1984 and 2019 from a 40km radius around 1,658 mineral deposits across the continent. Using state-of-the-art techniques in computer vision, we translate these images into economically meaningful indicators measuring local wealth and land use. We then use stacked event studies and difference-in-difference models to estimate the impact of mine openings and closings. We find strong evidence of a political resource curse at the local level. Although mining boosts the local economy in democratic countries, these gains are meagre in autocracies and come at the expense of an increase in localized conflict.

The discovery of topological states of matter has profoundly augmented our understanding of phase transitions in physical systems. Instead of local order parameters, topological phases are described by global topological invariants and are therefore robust against perturbations. A prominent example thereof is the two-dimensional integer quantum Hall effect. It is characterized by the first Chern number which manifests in the quantized Hall response induced by an external electric field. Generalizing the quantum Hall effect to four-dimensional systems leads to the appearance of a novel non-linear Hall response that is quantized as well, but described by a 4D topological invariant - the second Chern number. Here, we report on the first observation of a bulk response with intrinsic 4D topology and the measurement of the associated second Chern number. By implementing a 2D topological charge pump with ultracold bosonic atoms in an angled optical superlattice, we realize a dynamical version of the 4D integer quantum Hall effect.

The first-order relativistic fluid theories of dissipation proposed by Eckart and Landau-Lifshitz have been proved to be unstable. They admit solutions which start in proximity of equilibrium and depart exponentially from it. We show that this behaviour is due to the fact that the total entropy of these fluids, restricted to the dynamically accessible states, has no upper bound. As a result, these systems have the tendency to constantly change according to the second law of thermodynamics and the unstable modes represent the directions of growth of the entropy in state space.

Three key observables are considered: comoving number density, internal colour distribution; and the Kormendy relation.

Prior to adjustment, accounting conditions between national accounts data sets are frequently violated. Benchmarking is the procedure used by economic agencies to make such data sets consistent. It typically involves adjusting a high frequency time series (e.g. quarterly data) so it becomes consistent with a lower frequency version (e.g. annual data). Various methods have been developed to approach this problem of inconsistency between data sets. This paper introduces a new statistical procedure; namely wavelet benchmarking. Wavelet properties allow high and low frequency processes to be jointly analysed and we show that benchmarking can be formulated and approached succinctly in the wavelet domain. Furthermore the time and frequency localisation properties of wavelets are ideal for handling more complicated benchmarking problems.
