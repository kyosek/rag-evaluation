Existing deep learning (DL) based speech enhancement approaches are generally optimised to minimise the distance between clean and enhanced speech features. These often result in improved speech quality however they suffer from a lack of generalisation and may not deliver the required speech intelligibility in real noisy situations. In an attempt to address these challenges, researchers have explored intelligibility-oriented (I-O) loss functions and integration of audio-visual (AV) information for more robust speech enhancement (SE). In this paper, we introduce DL based I-O SE algorithms exploiting AV information, which is a novel and previously unexplored research direction. Specifically, we present a fully convolutional AV SE model that uses a modified short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) metric as a training cost function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits the integration of AV modalities with an I-O based loss function for SE. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that our proposed I-O AV SE framework outperforms audio-only (AO) and AV models trained with conventional distance-based loss functions, in terms of standard objective evaluation measures when dealing with unseen speakers and noises."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the novel contribution of the research presented in this paper?\n\nA) The development of a new deep learning model for speech enhancement\nB) The integration of audio-visual information in speech enhancement algorithms\nC) The use of intelligibility-oriented loss functions for speech enhancement\nD) The combination of audio-visual information with intelligibility-oriented loss functions for speech enhancement\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe key innovation in this research is the combination of two previously separate approaches: audio-visual (AV) information integration and intelligibility-oriented (I-O) loss functions for speech enhancement. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while the paper does present a new model, this is not the main novel contribution.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the integration of audio-visual information in speech enhancement has been explored before, as mentioned in the text: \"researchers have explored... integration of audio-visual (AV) information for more robust speech enhancement.\"\n\nOption C is also incorrect for the same reason; the text indicates that intelligibility-oriented loss functions have been previously explored.\n\nOption D is correct because the paper explicitly states: \"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits the integration of AV modalities with an I-O based loss function for SE.\" This combination of AV information with I-O loss functions represents the truly novel aspect of the research."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Management: An\n  Empirical Approach", "source": "Mao Guan, Xiao-Yang Liu", "docs_id": "2111.03995", "section": ["q-fin.PM", "cs.AI"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Management: An\n  Empirical Approach. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely studied in the portfolio management task. However, it is challenging to understand a DRL-based trading strategy because of the black-box nature of deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose an empirical approach to explain the strategies of DRL agents for the portfolio management task. First, we use a linear model in hindsight as the reference model, which finds the best portfolio weights by assuming knowing actual stock returns in foresight. In particular, we use the coefficients of a linear model in hindsight as the reference feature weights. Secondly, for DRL agents, we use integrated gradients to define the feature weights, which are the coefficients between reward and features under a linear regression model. Thirdly, we study the prediction power in two cases, single-step prediction and multi-step prediction. In particular, we quantify the prediction power by calculating the linear correlations between the feature weights of a DRL agent and the reference feature weights, and similarly for machine learning methods. Finally, we evaluate a portfolio management task on Dow Jones 30 constituent stocks during 01/01/2009 to 09/01/2021.

As a result, the exhaustive modeling of such problem is an involved task. Lattice Boltzmann simulations in 2D for capillary infiltration are carried out in the isothermal regime taking into account surface reaction and subsequent surface growth. Precisely, for a single capillary in the linear Washburn regime, special attention is paid to the retardation for the infiltration process induced by the thickening of the surface behind the contact line of the invading front. Interestingly, it turns out that the process of surface growth leading to pore closure marginally depends on the infiltration velocity. We conclude that porous matrices with straight and wide pathways represent the optimal case for impregnation. Our analysis includes also a comparison between the radii characterizing the infiltration process (i.e., minimum, hydraulic, average and effective radii)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the Lattice Boltzmann simulation of molten Si infiltration into carbon preforms, which of the following statements is correct regarding the surface growth effects on the infiltration process?\n\nA) The process of surface growth leading to pore closure is highly dependent on the infiltration velocity.\n\nB) The thickening of the surface behind the contact line of the invading front accelerates the infiltration process.\n\nC) Porous matrices with narrow and tortuous pathways represent the optimal case for impregnation.\n\nD) The surface growth effects cause a retardation of the infiltration process in the linear Washburn regime.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D.

Protein contacts contain important information for protein structure and functional study, but contact prediction from sequence information remains very challenging. Recently evolutionary coupling (EC) analysis, which predicts contacts by detecting co-evolved residues (or columns) in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA), has made good progress due to better statistical assessment techniques and high-throughput sequencing. Existing EC analysis methods predict only a single contact map for a given protein, which may have low accuracy especially when the protein under prediction does not have a large number of sequence homologs. Analogous to ab initio folding that usually predicts a few possible 3D models for a given protein sequence, this paper presents a novel structure learning method that can predict a set of diverse contact maps for a given protein sequence, in which the best solution usually has much better accuracy than the first one.

This heterogeneous framework enables us to capture dynamics at multiple timescales, expanding the model's applications and improving precision. We study the heterogeneous model theoretically and empirically to highlight essential mechanisms underlying certain market behaviors, such as transitions between bull- and bear markets and the self-similar behavior of price changes. Most importantly, we apply this model to show that the stock market is nearly efficient on intraday timescales, adjusting quickly to incoming news, but becomes inefficient on longer timescales, where news may have a long-lasting nonlinear impact on dynamics, attributable to a feedback mechanism acting over these horizons. Then, using the model, we design algorithmic strategies that utilize news flow, quantified and measured, as the only input to trade on market return forecasts over multiple horizons, from days to months. The backtested results suggest that the return is predictable to the extent that successful trading strategies can be constructed to harness this predictability."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the paper, which of the following statements best describes the relationship between market efficiency and time horizons in stock market returns?\n\nA) The stock market is equally efficient across all time horizons, from intraday to monthly scales.\n\nB) The stock market is inefficient on intraday timescales but becomes more efficient over longer periods.\n\nC) The stock market is nearly efficient on intraday timescales but becomes less efficient over longer horizons due to nonlinear news impacts and feedback mechanisms.\n\nD) The stock market's efficiency is constant across all time horizons, but the impact of news varies depending on the investment horizon.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Improving our knowledge on these influences can be utilized to decrease demand uncertainties. This paper aims to link smart water meter data to socio-economic user characteristics by applying a novel clustering algorithm that uses dynamic time warping on daily demand patterns. The approach is tested on simulated and measured single family home datasets. We show that the novel algorithm performs better compared to commonly used clustering methods, both, in finding the right number of clusters as well as assigning patterns correctly. Additionally, the methodology can be used to identify outliers within clusters of demand patterns. Furthermore, this study investigates which socio-economic characteristics (e.g. employment status, number of residents) are prevalent within single clusters and, consequently, can be linked to the shape of the cluster's barycenters. In future, the proposed methods in combination with stochastic demand models can be used to fill data-gaps in hydraulic models."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the primary objective and methodology of the research described in the Arxiv documentation?\n\nA) To develop a new water distribution system model using machine learning algorithms\nB) To apply dynamic time warping clustering on smart water meter data to discover socio-economic characteristics influencing water demand patterns\nC) To create a stochastic demand model for predicting future water consumption in urban areas\nD) To analyze the spatial variability of water demand using traditional statistical methods\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

We present the temperature dependence of the uniform susceptibility of spin-half quantum antiferromagnets on spatially anisotropic triangular-lattices, using high temperature series expansions. We consider a model with two exchange constants, $J_1$ and $J_2$ on a lattice that interpolates between the limits of a square-lattice ($J_1=0$), a triangular-lattice ($J_2=J_1$), and decoupled linear chains ($J_2=0$). In all cases, the susceptibility which has a Curie-Weiss behavior at high temperatures, rolls over and begins to decrease below a peak temperature, $T_p$. Scaling the exchange constants to get the same peak temperature, shows that the susceptibilities for the square-lattice and linear chain limits have similar magnitudes near the peak. Maximum deviation arises near the triangular-lattice limit, where frustration leads to much smaller susceptibility and with a flatter temperature dependence. We compare our results to the inorganic materials Cs$_2$CuCl$_4$ and Cs$_2$CuBr$_4$ and to a number of organic molecular crystals. We find that the former (Cs$_2$CuCl$_4$ and Cs$_2$CuBr$_4$) are weakly frustrated and their exchange parameters determined through the temperature dependence of the susceptibility are in agreement with neutron-scattering measurements.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the interplay of deterministic and stochastic models for epidemic diseases. Deterministic models for epidemic diseases are prone to predict global stability. If the natural birth and death rates are assumed small in comparison to disease parameters like the contact rate and the recovery rate, then the globally stable endemic equilibrium corresponds to a tiny proportion of infected individuals. Asymptotic equilibrium levels corresponding to low numbers of individuals invalidate the deterministic results. Diffusion effects force frequency functions of the stochastic model to possess similar stability properties as the deterministic model. Particular simulations of the stochastic model are, however, oscillatory and predict oscillatory patterns. Smaller or isolated populations show longer periods, more violent oscillations, and larger probabilities of extinction. We prove that evolution maximizes the infectiousness of the disease as measured by the ability to increase the proportion of infected individuals.
