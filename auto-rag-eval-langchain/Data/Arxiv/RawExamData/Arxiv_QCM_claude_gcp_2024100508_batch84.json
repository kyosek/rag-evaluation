Evidence shows that in a significant number of cases the current methods of research do not allow for reproducible and falsifiable procedures of scientific investigation. As a consequence, the majority of critical decisions at all levels, from personal investment choices to overreaching global policies, rely on some variation of try-and-error and are mostly non-scientific by definition. We lack transparency for procedures and evidence, proper explanation of market events, predictability on effects, or identification of causes. There is no clear demarcation of what is inherently scientific, and as a consequence, the line between fake and genuine is blurred. This paper presents highlights of the Theory of Enablers for Crowd-Based Scientific Investigation, or Theory of Enablers for short. The Theory of Enablers assumes the use of a next-generation investigative approach leveraging forces of human diversity, micro-specialized crowds, and proper computer-assisted control methods associated with accessibility, reproducibility, communication, and collaboration. This paper defines the set of very specific cognitive and non-cognitive enablers for crowd-based scientific investigation: methods of proof, large-scale collaboration, and a domain-specific computational representation.

We greatly increase the number of 7-10 Myr old T Tauri stars observed in the X-rays by including observations of the well populated 25 Ori aggregate in the Orion OB1a subassociation.

Twenty years after, in 1997, the pseudospin symmetry has been revealed by Ginocchio as a relativistic symmetry of the atomic nuclei when it is described by relativistic mean field hadronic models.

Recent evidence of a young progenitor population for many Type-Ia SNe (SNe-Ia) raises the possibility that evolved intermediate-mass progenitor stars may be detected in pre-explosion images. NGC 1316, a radio galaxy in the Fornax cluster, is a prolific producer of SNe-Ia, with four detected since 1980. We analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) pre-explosion images of the sites of two of the SNe-Ia that exploded in this galaxy, SN2006dd (a normal Type-Ia) and SN2006mr (likely a subluminous, 1991bg-like, SN-Ia).

For intermediate couplings, a simple approximate theory, that describes the particle dynamics in vertical clusters of two corresponding parallel sites exactly and neglects the correlations between different vertical clusters, is developed.
