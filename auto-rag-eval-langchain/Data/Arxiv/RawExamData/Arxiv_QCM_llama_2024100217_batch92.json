The dynamics of dispersal-structured populations, consisting of competing individuals that are characterized by different diffusion coefficients but are otherwise identical, is investigated. Competition is taken into account through demographic processes. The problem addressed models natural selection. It is observed that the mean value and the relative width of the initial distribution of the diffusion coefficients characterizing the individuals together with the temporal fluctuations determine the final distribution of the diffusivities (diffusion coefficients leading to the competition success) as well as the final diversity of the system at finite time (the number of different diffusion coefficients present in the system). Large initial mean diffusivity of the system leads to a rather fast disappearance of the diversity. Instead, small initial mean diffusivity of the system leads to a diversity equal to the number of niches forming in the system due to the competitive interactions.

Acoustic solitons obtained through a reductive perturbation scheme are normally governed by a Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. In multispecies plasmas at critical compositions the coefficient of the quadratic nonlinearity vanishes. Extending the analytic treatment then leads to a modified KdV (mKdV) equation, which is characterized by a cubic nonlinearity and is even in the electrostatic potential. The mKdV equation admits solitons having opposite electrostatic polarities, in contrast to KdV solitons which can only be of one polarity at a time. A Hirota formalism has been used to derive the two-soliton solution. That solution covers not only the interaction of same-polarity solitons but also the collision of compressive and rarefactive solitons. For the visualisation of the solutions, the focus is on the details of the interaction region. A novel and detailed discussion is included of typical electric field signatures that are often observed in ionospheric and magnetospheric plasmas. It is argued that these signatures can be attributed to solitons and their interactions. As such, they have received little attention."}, "answer": "Here is the difficult multi-form question:\n\nWhat is the primary difference between the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and the modified KdV (mKdV) equation in the context of acoustic solitons in plasmas at critical compositions?\n\nA) The mKdV equation has a higher coefficient of nonlinearity than the KdV equation.\nB) The mKdV equation admits solitons with opposite electrostatic polarities, whereas the KdV equation only admits solitons of one polarity.\nC) The mKdV equation is only applicable to multispecies plasmas, whereas the KdV equation is applicable to single-species plasmas.\nD) The mKdV equation has a different form than the KdV equation, with a different set of coefficients.\n\nCorrect Answer: B) The mKdV equation admits solitons with opposite electrostatic polarities, whereas the KdV equation only admits solitons of one polarity.\n\nExplanation: The question requires the test-taker to understand the key difference between the KdV and mKdV equations in the context of acoustic solitons in plasmas at critical compositions.
