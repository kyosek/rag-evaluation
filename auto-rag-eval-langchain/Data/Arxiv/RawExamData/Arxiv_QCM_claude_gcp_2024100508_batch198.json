Incorporating side observations in decision making can reduce uncertainty and boost performance, but it also requires we tackle a potentially complex predictive relationship. While one may use off-the-shelf machine learning methods to separately learn a predictive model and plug it in, a variety of recent methods instead integrate estimation and optimization by fitting the model to directly optimize downstream decision performance. Surprisingly, in the case of contextual linear optimization, we show that the naive plug-in approach actually achieves regret convergence rates that are significantly faster than methods that directly optimize downstream decision performance. We show this by leveraging the fact that specific problem instances do not have arbitrarily bad near-dual-degeneracy. While there are other pros and cons to consider as we discuss and illustrate numerically, our results highlight a nuanced landscape for the enterprise to integrate estimation and optimization.

Identification of every single genome present in a microbial sample is an important and challenging task with crucial applications.

The most accurate method to date is exhaustive single cell sequencing using multiple displacement amplification, which is simply intractable for a large number of cells. However, there is hope for breaking this barrier as the number of different cell types with distinct genome sequences is usually much smaller than the number of cells.

A drawback of this method is that the resulting quantized theory does not have manifest Lorentz invariance. This motivated the quest of alternatives to the usual Hamiltonian theory on the space of sections; a particular instance of this search is the so called restricted Hamiltonian theory, where the equations of motion of a field theory are formulated by means of a multisymplectic structure, a kind of generalization of the symplectic form to the multidimensional context, and even a constraint algorithm working in this context has been proposed.
