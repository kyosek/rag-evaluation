The correct answer is C because the documentation explicitly states that \"At variance to the MIT-Bag results, with fixed current quark masses, the main important effect of the chiral dynamics is the appearance of an End-Point for the coexistence zone.\" This highlights a crucial distinction between the two models, where the NJL model's incorporation of dynamical quark masses leads to the prediction of an End-Point in the coexistence zone, which is not present in the simpler MIT-Bag model."}, "55": {"documentation": {"title": "Quarkonium Hybrids with Nonrelativistic Effective Field Theories", "source": "Matthias Berwein, Nora Brambilla, Jaume Tarrus Castella, Antonio Vairo", "docs_id": "1510.04299", "section": ["hep-ph", "hep-lat"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Quarkonium Hybrids with Nonrelativistic Effective Field Theories.

This paper examines the dynamic interaction between falling and rising markets for both the real and the financial sectors of the largest economy in the world using asymmetric causality tests.

The positive components represent the rising markets and the negative components embody the falling markets. The sample period covers some part of the COVID19 pandemic. Since the data is non normal and the volatility is time varying, the bootstrap simulations with leverage adjustments are used in order to create reliable critical values when causality tests are conducted. The results of the asymmetric causality tests disclose that the bear markets are causing the recessions as well as the bull markets are causing the economic expansions. The causal effect of bull markets on economic expansions is higher compared to the causal effect of bear markets on economic recessions.

We derive equations for aggregate demand from this micro setting and embed them in the Solow growth economy.
