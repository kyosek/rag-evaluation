Half of the flares were associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The goal of our survey is to assess the frequency of hot flux ropes in large flares irrespective of their formation time relative to the onset of eruptions. The flux ropes were identified in 131 A images using morphological criteria and their high temperatures were confirmed by their absence in the cooler 171 and 304 A passbands. We found hot flux ropes in 45 of our events (32% of the flares); 11 of them were associated with confined flares while the remaining 34 were associated with eruptive flares. Therefore almost half (49%) of the eruptive events involved a hot flux rope configuration.

Pinning-type magnets maintaining high coercivity, i.e. the ability to sustain magnetization, at high temperature are at the core of thriving clean-energy technologies.

However, despite decades of efforts to optimize the intragranular microstructure, the coercivity currently only reaches 20~30% of the theoretical limits.

In contrast to previous works which generally assume the ground truth of training data is a perfect reflection of the reality, we consider here the more common imperfect case of ground truth uncertainty in the wild. We first illustrate its manifestation as various kinds of artifacts including zipper effect, color moire and residual noise.

We present a new parton model approach for hadron-hadron interactions and, in particular, for the initial stage of nuclear collisions at very high energies (RHIC, LHC and beyond). The most important aspect of our approach is a self-consistent treatment, using the same formalism for calculating cross sections and particle production, based on an effective, QCD-inspired field theory, where many of the inconsistencies of presently used models will be avoided. In addition, we provide a unified treatment of soft and hard scattering, such that there is no fundamental cutoff parameter any more defining an artificial border between soft and hard scattering. Our approach cures some of the main deficiencies of two of the standard procedures currently used: the Gribov-Regge theory and the eikonalized parton model. There, cross section calculations and particle production cannot be treated in a consistent way using a common formalism. In particular, energy conservation is taken care of in case of particle production, but not concerning cross section calculations. In addition, hard contributions depend crucially on some cutoff, being divergent for the cutoff being zero. Finally, in case of several elementary scatterings, they are not treated on the same level: the first collision is always treated differently than the subsequent ones.

The first field theory is quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions (QED3) with four flavors of fermions. We show this theory can describe the surfaces of a majority of bosonic pgSPT phases protected by a single mirror reflection, or by $C_{nv}$ point group symmetry for $n=2,3,4,6$. The second field theory is a variant of QED3 with charge-1 and charge-3 Dirac fermions. This field theory can describe the surface of a reflection symmetric pgSPT phase built by placing an $E_{8}$ state on the mirror plane. The third field theory is an ${\\rm O}(4)$ non-linear sigma model with a topological theta-term at $\\theta=\\pi$, or, equivalently, a non-compact ${\\rm CP}^1$ model. Using a coupled wire construction, we show this is a surface theory for bosonic pgSPT phases with ${\\rm U}(1) \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{P}$ symmetry. For the latter two field theories, we discuss the connection to gapped surfaces with topological order. Moreover, we conjecture that the latter two field theories can describe surfaces of more general bosonic pgSPT phases with $C_{nv}$ point group symmetry."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the common feature among the three surface field theories identified in the paper \"Surface field theories of point group symmetry protected topological phases\" that allows them to describe the surfaces of bosonic point group symmetry protected topological (pgSPT) phases?\n\nA) The presence of a topological theta-term\nB) The existence of a mirror reflection symmetry\nC) The inclusion of both charge-1 and charge-3 Dirac fermions\nD) The presence of a non-compact CP^1 model\n\nCorrect Answer: B) The existence of a mirror reflection symmetry\n\nExplanation: The paper highlights that the three surface field theories can describe the surfaces of bosonic pgSPT phases protected by a single mirror reflection, or by Cnv point group symmetry for n=2,3,4,6.
