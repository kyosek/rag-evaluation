Since it is economically challenging to deploy wired backhaul every few hundred meters, relays (e.g., wireless access points) have been proposed to extend the coverage of a base station which has wired connection to the core network. These relays, deployed every few hundred meters, serve the users in their vicinity and are backhauled to the base station through wireless connections.

In the present paper it is shown that closed exterior forms corresponding to field theories are obtained from the equations modelling conservation (balance)laws for material media. It has been developed the evolutionary method that enables one to describe the process of obtaining closed exterior forms. The process of obtaining closed exterior forms discloses the mechanism of evolutionary processes in material media and shows that material media generate, discretely, the physical structures, from which the physical fields are formed. This justifies the quantum character of field theories.

It also mentions that this approach \"avoids the need for explicit regularisation\" and allows the algorithm to \"remain simple, without projections or dual methods.\" This aligns perfectly with option B.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the approach specifically avoids explicit regularisation techniques like adding constraints to the empirical risk minimisation rule.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the approach does establish graph-independent generalisation bounds, these are said to match the centralised setting, not surpass it.

In this work, we propose the first large scale study of automatic speech recognition (ASR) in Sanskrit, with an emphasis on the impact of unit selection in Sanskrit ASR. In this work, we release a 78 hour ASR dataset for Sanskrit, which faithfully captures several of the linguistic characteristics expressed by the language.
