We use data at 131, 171, and 304 A from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to search for hot flux ropes in 141 M-class and X-class solar flares that occurred at solar longitudes equal to or larger than 50 degrees. Half of the flares were associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The goal of our survey is to assess the frequency of hot flux ropes in large flares irrespective of their formation time relative to the onset of eruptions. The flux ropes were identified in 131 A images using morphological criteria and their high temperatures were confirmed by their absence in the cooler 171 and 304 A passbands. We found hot flux ropes in 45 of our events (32% of the flares); 11 of them were associated with confined flares while the remaining 34 were associated with eruptive flares.

However, despite decades of efforts to optimize the intragranular microstructure, the coercivity currently only reaches 20~30% of the theoretical limits. Here, the roles of the grain-interior nanostructure and the grain boundaries in controlling coercivity are disentangled by an emerging magneto-electric approach.

In situ magneto-structural measurements and atomic-scale tracking of hydrogen atoms reveal that the segregation of hydrogen atoms at the grain boundaries, rather than the change of the crystal structure, dominates the reversible and substantial change of coercivity. Hydrogen lowers the local magnetocrystalline anisotropy and facilitates the magnetization reversal starting from the grain boundaries.

Image demosaicking and denoising are the two key fundamental steps in digital camera pipelines, aiming to reconstruct clean color images from noisy luminance readings. In this paper, we propose and study Wild-JDD, a novel learning framework for joint demosaicking and denoising in the wild. In contrast to previous works which generally assume the ground truth of training data is a perfect reflection of the reality, we consider here the more common imperfect case of ground truth uncertainty in the wild. We first illustrate its manifestation as various kinds of artifacts including zipper effect, color moire and residual noise. Then we formulate a two-stage data degradation process to capture such ground truth uncertainty, where a conjugate prior distribution is imposed upon a base distribution. After that, we derive an evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss to train a neural network that approximates the parameters of the conjugate prior distribution conditioned on the degraded input. Finally, to further enhance the performance for out-of-distribution input, we design a simple but effective fine-tuning strategy by taking the input as a weakly informative prior.

It then uses an evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss to train a neural network that approximates the parameters of a conjugate prior distribution conditioned on the degraded input.

The nucleon and Delta baryons are treated as quark-diquark bound states, where the ingredients of the electromagnetic transition current are computed self-consistently from the underlying dynamics in QCD. Although our approach does not include pion-cloud effects, we find that the electric and Coulomb quadrupole form-factor ratios R_EM and R_SM show good agreement with experimental data. This implies that the deformation from a spherical charge distribution inside both baryons can be traced back to the appearance of p waves in the nucleon and Delta bound-state amplitudes which are a consequence of Poincare covariance. On the other hand, the dominant transition amplitude, i.e. the magnetic dipole transition form factor, underestimates the data by ~25% in the static limit whereas agreement is achieved at larger momentum transfer, which is consistent with missing pion-cloud contributions.
