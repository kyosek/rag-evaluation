The interaction between equilibrium tides and convection in stellar envelopes is often considered important for tidal evolution in close binary and extrasolar planetary systems.

Recent numerical simulations indicate that convection can act like an effective viscosity which decays quadratically with tidal frequency for fast tides, resulting in inefficient dissipation in many applications involving pre- and main-sequence stars and giant planets. A new idea was however recently proposed by Terquem (2021), who suggested Reynolds stresses involving correlations between tidal flow components dominate the interaction instead of correlations between convective flow components as usually assumed.

The literature suggests that autonomous vehicles (AVs) may drastically change the user experience of private automobile travel by allowing users to engage in productive or relaxing activities while travelling. As a consequence, the generalised cost of car travel may decrease, and car users may become less sensitive to travel time. By facilitating private motorised mobility, AVs may eventually impact land use and households' residential location choices. This paper seeks to advance the understanding of the potential impacts of AVs on travel behaviour and land use by investigating stated preferences for combinations of residential locations and travel options for the commute in the context of autonomous automobile travel.
