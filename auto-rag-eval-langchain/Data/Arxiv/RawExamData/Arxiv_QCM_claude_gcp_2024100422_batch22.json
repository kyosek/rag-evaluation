Using real and synthetic Type Ia SNe (SNeIa) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data representing current observations forecasts, this paper investigates the tension between those probes in the dark energy equation of state (EoS) reconstruction considering the well known CPL model and Wang's low correlation reformulation. In particular, here we present simulations of BAO data from both the the radial and transverse directions. We also explore the influence of priors on Omega_m and Omega_b on the tension issue, by considering 1-sigma deviations in either one or both of them. Our results indicate that for some priors there is no tension between a single dataset (either SNeIa or BAO) and their combination (SNeIa+BAO). Our criterion to discern the existence of tension (sigma-distance) is also useful to establish which is the dataset with most constraining power; in this respect SNeIa and BAO data switch roles when current and future data are considered, as forecasts predict and spectacular quality improvement on BAO data. We also find that the results on the tension are blind to the way the CPL model is addressed: there is a perfect match between the original formulation and that by the low correlation optimized, but the errors on the parameters are much narrower in all cases of our exhaustive exploration, thus serving the purpose of stressing the convenience of this reparametrization."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the findings of the study regarding the tension between SNeIa and BAO data in dark energy equation of state reconstruction?\n\nA) The study found persistent tension between SNeIa and BAO data regardless of priors on Omega_m and Omega_b.\n\nB) The tension between SNeIa and BAO data was completely resolved when using Wang's low correlation reformulation of the CPL model.\n\nC) The study demonstrated that for some priors, there is no tension between a single dataset (either SNeIa or BAO) and their combination (SNeIa+BAO).\n\nD) Future forecasts predict that SNeIa data will always have more constraining power than BAO data in dark energy EoS reconstruction.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Using two types of N-body experiment we determine the post-formation collision probabilities of these massive hierarchies.

The Simultaneous Long-Short(SLS) controller for trading a single stock is known to guarantee positive expected value of the resulting gain-loss function with respect to a large class of stock price dynamics. In the literature, this is known as the Robust Positive Expectation(RPE)property. An obvious way to extend this theory to the trading of two stocks is to trade each one of them using its own independent SLS controller. Motivated by the fact that such a scheme does not exploit any correlation between the two stocks, we study the case when the relative sign between the drifts of the two stocks is known. The main contributions of this paper are three-fold: First, we put forward a novel architecture in which we cross-couple two SLS controllers for the two-stock case. Second, we derive a closed-form expression for the expected value of the gain-loss function. Third, we use this closed-form expression to prove that the RPE property is guaranteed with respect to a large class of stock-price dynamics. When more information over and above the relative sign is assumed, additional benefits of the new architecture are seen.

The research introduces a novel architecture that cross-couples two SLS controllers for trading two stocks.

Since Kolmogorov proposed his phenomenological theory of hydrodynamic turbulence in 1941, the description of mechanism leading to the energy cascade and anomalous scaling remains an open problem in fluid mechanics. Soon after, in 1949 Onsager noticed that the scaling properties in inertial range imply non-differentiability of the velocity field in the limit of vanishing viscosity. This observation suggests that the turbulence mechanism may be related to a finite-time singularity (blowup) of incompressible Euler equations. However, the existence of such blowup is still an open problem too. In this paper, we show that the blowup indeed represents the driving mechanism of inertial range for a simplified (shell) model of turbulence. Here, blowups generate coherent structures (instantons), which travel through the inertial range in finite time and are described by universal self-similar statistics.

I show that this expectation is realized for periods small compared to the duration of the experiment P/T << 1, but not when P/T >~ 1.

This qualitative difference carries over to the more complicated case in which the planet is being monitored in the presence of a distant companion that generates an approximately uniform acceleration. The period errors begin deteriorating somewhat earlier in all cases, but the situation is qualitatively similar to that of the mass errors.
