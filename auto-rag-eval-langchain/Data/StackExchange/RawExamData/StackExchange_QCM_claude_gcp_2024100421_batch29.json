Like all geodata products it's got some errors and omissions, but it's generally good \\- even in remote areas. This is useful for address suggestion and geocoding (some of the major parts of what I want to achieve).\n\nI'd like to broaden my knowledge beyond just the UK. What's the best data available for the United States, and how good is it?\n\nI'm aware that the USPS has [a \"zip\\+4\" file that contains 30 million addresses](https://www.usps.com/business/address-information-systems.htm) (presumably not a full list of addresses in a country of 300 million people); that Navteq's map data contains street number ranges (in the UK their accuracy is OK but not the best); that Google have a geocoding API (I would prefer a database rather than an API); and that [TIGER data contains some address information](http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger.html) (I haven't fully investigated this \\- is it any good?). Should I be looking at one of these options in more detail, or are there other sources I've missed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I used to work at [SmartyStreets](https://smartystreets.com), a licensed CASS\u2122 vendor of USPS address data. What you want to do sounds *exactly* like what they do.\n\nThe USPS ZIP\\+4 file is available from many sellers, but you're right: it only contains about 30\\-40 million records. We sometimes called it the \"ranges\" file because it contains address data at a *range* level only. In other words, it provides street names in cities/states with a range of primary numbers, say, 100\\-8000, where, in rural areas, only a few of those numbers actually exist.\n\nThe full USPS address database comes to licensed CASS\u2122 vendors and the like, which has some added expenses and certification tests.\n\nUSPS data contains no geocoding or geolocation data. The USPS' primary concern is mailing: routing and delivering mail. Any correlation between address data such as ZIP codes and actual coordinates or physical proximity [is entirely coincidental](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13112899/how-to-get-the-bounding-coordinates-for-a-us-postalzip-code/13114578#13114578). \n\nThe USPS data is considered a *private* source. It is expensive to obtain and license, and typically requires conforming to rigorous terms and quality testing (like CASS\u2122 Certification.)\n\nTIGER data is a freely available, *public* data source. However, it does not correlate to USPS data, except for ZCTAs which were created several years ago. The only way to update that data, as I understand, is to start with the old data and apply all the delta files between now and then.\n\nTIGER geocoding data is not very accurate and is often outdated. (At SmartyStreets, we've been bitten by this before.) Further, converting Census Bureau data into address coordinates is a slow, tedious process.\n\nIf you're doing precision skydiving based on TIGER data, you should verify the coordinates yourself. That's how companies like Google, with *excellent* geocoding capabilities, have amassed much of their data: driving vehicles on all the streets to manually collect map and coordinate data, then aggregate theirs with public sources, to produce very high\\-quality, competitive, *and super\\-expensive* results.\n\nTo compensate for poor quality public sources, we've worked with private geocoding services to obtain much better data (rolling out over the next few weeks, in fact).\n\nAs for database vs. API \\-\\- good luck.

You probably don't have enough gate drive voltage. Did you even look at the datasheet for the transistor you are using? If you had, you would have seen at what gate voltage it is intended to run at. Something rated for 60 V and 110 A almost certainly requires 12 V or so on the gate to get to the rated RDSON.\n\nWith only partial gate drive of 3\\.3 or 5 V, the effective resistance of the FET is much higher. This causes it to dissipate enough power to heat up to the point of self\\-destruction.\n\n- You don't have a flyback diode across the motor. There should be a diode in reverse across the motor. This is reverse\\-biased and does nothing when the motor is running normally. However, when you turn the motor off, it provides a safe path for the inductive kickback current. Without the diode when you try to switch off the motor, its inductance makes whatever voltage it takes to keep the same current running in the immediate short term. That means abusing the FET to the point where it conducts anyway, even though it is driven to off. That's bad for the FET."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is attempting to control a 48V DC motor using an Arduino and a MOSFET (IRF3205).

Insufficient gate drive voltage: The Arduino likely provides only 3.3V or 5V to the MOSFET gate, which is insufficient for a high-power MOSFET like the IRF3205. This causes the MOSFET to operate in a high-resistance state, leading to excessive heat generation.\n\n2. Missing flyback diode: The circuit diagram shows no flyback diode across the motor.

They are 5 amps at 12 volt output (60 watts). Allowing for inefficiency, they probably draw 80 watts max on the 120VAC side. Three of them would be 240W, easily within the 1800W (120Vx15A) hard max on a 15A circuit. Like this. \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dSFX5.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dSFX5.png)\n\nAll the DC wiring here can be 18 AWG except for the 120VAC wiring on the left, which must be 14AWG. You see why I don't like those power supplies? \n\nHowever having worked with LED strips a lot, you are not going to be happy with the final result. You will have 3 separate installations of LED strip that will operate totally independently from each other and respond separately to commands from the remote. Not every controller will see every signal from the remote, so you'll never get the colors or brightness to match each other, assuming all 3 remotes are even compatible with each other (and not serialized). If you are rolling/cycling colors, the three strips will be out of sync. Try it for yourself, but I think it will find it frustrating, amateurish and dreadful, and you'll either rip it out in frustration, or look for a better way to do it. \n\nFor 12VDC to the strip lights\n-----------------------------\n\nThere are several ways to make an installation of this size work well. One is to power them all from a single larger DC supply, and have all that go through dimmers/amplifiers. Here on out I assume you have a larger 12VDC supply of your own. \n\nThe \"standard\" in LED strips is generally: \n\n* 12 volts DC\n* 300 emitters per 5 meters\n* 2 amps per channel per 300 emitters \\-\\- in a 3528 single\\-color strip, that's straight up 2 amps. 5050s have 3 emitters \\- commonly RGB but sometimes WWW (all three white). They have 3 channels, 2 amps per channel or 6A total.\n\nOf course there are modifications on that. Double density or half density; 24V; coolwhite\\-warmwhite\\-yellow, just to name a few. \n\nYour example seems to be a peculiar one. It's 5050, but they seem to be alternating RGB with WWW. They claim that the WWW can be controlled separately from the RGB (you would hope!) but that means they are doing something weird in terms of how the strip is wired. It is not 3 channels, it looks like 4\\. \n\nBut since half the total lights are on the \"white\" chanel, half the 6A power is on that channel, or 3A per strip. The three RGB channels split what remains, 1A each. \n\nPower all three strips from one supply\n--------------------------------------\n\nThree strips together would be 9A on the white, 3A on each R/G/B color, or 18A for any feeder wire that is handling all the power for all of them. Also, 18A on the return ('neutral') wire. \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/owSiG.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/owSiG.png)\n\nThe 120VAC wire must be 14AWG. The feed between power supply and controller must be 12AWG (14AWG would not suffice \\- I believe that was your original question.) If any distance is involved, go10 AWG and you'll want stranded wire so it's more flexible. The return back from the strip must also be 12AWG and the \"white\" wire must be 16 AWG or larger. Color wires can be 18AWG or larger.\n\nSince you're working in DC power, there is no requirement to have the \"return\" wire run in the same cable as the \"supply\" wires. So you could use 14/4 for the supply to all 4 colors, then run a single\\-strand 12AWG wire for the return. Or 12/2 for the white and return, and 18AWG thermostat wire for the rest. Since it's low voltage DC you are not obliged to use white/blue for neutral and green for ground. \n\nAnother option is do a separate \"homerun\" for each 5\\-metre strip, so the return would be only 6 amps, which would permit you to use 18AWG intercom wire of however many strands you need. \n\nOne controller, three power supplies\n------------------------------------\n\nYou could power each strip separately, and control them centrally using amplifiers. To do this, assemble each LED strip in the normal way, but use an amplifier where the controller would go. Then use one controller, and split its R G B W and common wires to each of the amplifiers. This means all three strings will be the same color, do the same patterns, etc. You will end up with 2 spare controllers, but you will have to buy 3 amplifiers.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mcbFq.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mcbFq.png)\n\nAll the wire can be 18 AWG here except for the 120VAC wiring which must be 14AWG. The wires to the controller draw very low current, but wire thinner than 18AWG isn't any cheaper. \n\n(it's possible to hook up one string normally and use amplifiers only with the other two. I don't recommend that, it'll be hard to troubleshoot, and the strings will not be equal.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is installing three 5-meter LED strip lights, each requiring 9A on the white channel and 1A each on the R, G, and B channels.

For the case $n \\= 3$ I suspect there are 6 symmetries ( 3 translational and 3 rotational) but for the general case when $n \\> 3$ , I don't reach the minimum amount of symmetries they gave me as a hint.

How does one find all the possible transformations that leave the Lagrangian invariant \\+ getting all the conserved quantities?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We are all struck by cosmic rays in the form of relativistic ions, many times in our lives. See, for example, [this paper](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2017/reviews/rpp2017-rev-cosmic-rays.pdf). There is a phenomenon called the \"[Bragg peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragg_peak)\" that seems to limit the energy deposition rate when an ion beam is passing through material, resulting in a large fraction of net energy being deposited in the last relatively small fraction of the beam path. So, if the ion energy is high enough, most of the beam energy ends up somewhere on the far side of a finite\\-thickness target like a human being.\n\nInteraction of a *single* particle with a human body, of course, is probabilistic. There's a finite chance the particle will interact with an atom near the start of its path through the body, and the same goes for its chances of interacting at any interval along its path. So, your question really asks whether or not destruction of everything along any specific very thin path through the body can kill. I doubt it, but am not sure. It seems very unlikely that destruction of, e.g., all the nerves along a sub\\-millimeter long straight path would kill. There's a *lot* of redundancy in our neural circuitry (for good Darwinian reasons, considering that we're constantly bombarded with cosmic rays!)."}, "answer": "I apologize, but there seems to be a mismatch between the documentation provided and the request to generate an exam question. The documentation discusses cosmic rays and their interaction with the human body, while the request is for a multi-choice question based on this information. \n\nAdditionally, the initial part of the documentation appears to be about a classical mechanics problem involving Lagrangians and symmetries, which is unrelated to the cosmic ray information that follows.\n\nTo properly generate a relevant exam question, I would need coherent information on a single topic. If you'd like a question about cosmic rays or about classical mechanics, please provide the appropriate background information, and I'd be happy to create a suitable exam question based on that."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/02/16", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/614992", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/175/"], "docs_id": 614992, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I frequently hear that galaxies are moving apart *(in some instances, faster than the speed of light)* because the fabric of spacetime is expanding. The common analogy is two people standing on the surface of an expanding balloon.\n\nHowever, this makes no sense. Since we are made of matter that exists within spacetime, shouldn't we *(and all of our unit lengths)* be expanding at the same rate? In the balloon analogy, if the people are drawn onto the balloon, they will expand at the same rate as its surface. If you draw a coordinate grid onto the balloon, distances measured using those coordinates will stay constant as the balloon expands.\n\n**So what's really going on?**\n\n---\n\nNote: Astrophysicist Nick Lucid from Science Asylum [explained in a Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B4tj9c0vG8) that it's because electromagnetic force holding our atoms together is so strong, it keeps us at the same size while spacetime expands.

These systems are gravitationally bound such that they resist the expansion on the universe. In other words they don't participate in the expansion of the universe. Coming back to the ballon analogy it is as if such systems were connected by invisible threads. Only even larger structures e.g. super clusters are expanding so that the proper distances *between* the clusters are increasing.\n\nNote that the coordinate grid is a mathematical tool.

This is analogous to these systems being connected by invisible threads in the balloon model, preventing them from expanding with the rest of space. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the resistance to expansion is not attributed to dark matter. \nOption C contradicts the given information, which states that these systems do not participate in the expansion. \nOption D is based on a misconception mentioned in the note, which the main explanation does not support."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/04/10", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/129578", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 129578, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There's a bazillion hard disk encryption HOWTOs, but somehow I can't find one that actually does what I want.

I want to setup encryption for home dirs on the NAS so that:\n\n* It does not interfere with the boot process (since the NAS it tucked away in a cupboard),\n* the home dirs should be accessible as a regular file system on the client(s) (e.g. via SMB),\n* it is easy to use by 'normal' people, (so it does not require SSH\\-ing to the NAS, mount the encrypted partition on command line, then connecting via SMB, and finally umount the partition after being done. I can't explain that to my mom, or in fact to anyone.)\n* does not store the encryption key the NAS itself,\n* encrypts file meta\\-data and content (i.e. safe against the 'RIAA' attack, where an intruder should not be able to identify which songs are in your MP3 collection).\n\nWhat I hoped to do was use Samba \\+ PAM. The idea was that on connecting to the SMB server, I'd have to enter the password on the client, which sends it to the server for authentication, which would use the password to mount the encrpytion partition, and would unmount it again when the session was closed. Turns out that doesn't really work, because SMB does not transmit the password in the plain and hence I can't configure PAM to use the incoming password to mount the encrypted patition.\n\nSo... anything I'm overlooking?

It seemed to be working fine, but there was no sound, so I installed the Windows Bootcamp software from the OSX 10\\.6 DVD. It installed a ton of drivers, and now I have sound... yay, but the Apple Cinema HD Display brightness was set to minimum. Everything was too dark.\n\nNow there doesn't appear to be any way to increase the brightness. The button on the monitor does nothing. There's no Windows option that I can see. The monitor driver is set to \"Generic PnP Monitor\", which sounds like it could be the problem.\n\nI can boot back into OSX and change the brightness there, and it sticks until I log into Windows where it returns to the minimum brightness again (so it stays bright all through the booting of Windows).\n\nIt seems my only option is to uninstall the Apple Bootcamp software and lose the sound again. \n\nAnyone got any ideas?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My research has led to the following conclusions: This is a problem that was introduced by Apple in Bootcamp 2\\.1 and can be fixed in the following ways:\n\nIf you're running a 32\\-bit version of Windows, simply install **WinACD**, which adds Apple Cinema Display controls to Windows Display Properties.\n\nLink: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/winacd/>\n\nIf you're running a 64\\-bit version of Windows, then things get a little more complicated, as the WinACD driver is not compatible. There are a few hacks:\n\n1. Boot into OSX, turn the brightness to your desired level, unplug the USB cable going into your monitor. Boot back into Windows and the Bootcamp software will now be unable to reduce the brightness over USB. (Downside: The USB ports on your monitor will no longer be useable.)\n2. Stop the Bootcamp software from starting when Windows boots. (Go into MSConfig \\> Startup Items and disable Bootcamp.) Then boot into OSX, turn the brightness to your desired level, and when you return to Windows, the software will no longer run and turn the brightness down to 0\\. (Downside: You won't be able to use the \"special\" keys on your Apple keyboard (e.g. volume control), and you may possibly lose other minor Apple functionality.)\n\nThe bottom line is that Apple seem to have deliberately done this. It's their software, and *not* Windows, reducing the brightness of the Apple Cinema Display, and it has done since they deliberately programmed it to, in version 2\\.1\\. This \"feature\" is present in every version of Bootcamp up to 3\\.3\\.\n\nSource: [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1515442?start\\=0\\&tstart\\=0](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1515442?start=0&tstart=0)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user has installed Windows 7 x64 on an Intel Mac using Boot Camp.

Since the bulb is connected in parallel with R2, it experiences the same voltage drop. With less voltage across the bulb, it receives less power and therefore becomes dimmer. This follows from the voltage divider principle, where reducing one resistance in the series changes the proportion of total voltage dropped across each component."}, "17": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/07/22", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/90", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/97/"], "docs_id": 90, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A couple of days ago I installed the demo of spatialware 4\\.9 from MapInfo into my SQL Server 2005 install and loaded all the larger dataset into it.

A Raspberry Pi's timers are not capable of generating signals at 120 MHz, which is far beyond its capabilities.\n\nB) Correct. This approach combines cost-effectiveness with the ability to generate the required signal. The crystal oscillator provides a stable 120 MHz base frequency, while the Schmitt trigger shapes the sinusoidal output into a clean square wave. This method also ensures sufficient signal strength for transmission to the SerDes component.\n\nC) Incorrect. While an FPGA or CPLD could generate the required signal, this solution would be significantly more expensive and complex than necessary for this simple task.\n\nD) Incorrect.

Reinstall Magento from scratch.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The error \"SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No such file or directory\" typically occurs when the Zend Framework (used by Magento) cannot resolve the MySQL host defined in the app/etc/local.xml file. This intermittent issue is likely caused by DNS resolution failures during peak loads or resource overages. The recommended solution is to contact the hosting support to replace the MySQL server hostname with its IP address in the app/etc/local.xml file. This bypasses the need for DNS resolution. Additionally, the hosting provider should investigate why the hostname cannot be resolved consistently, checking for any resource shortages or resolver outages that may be causing the problem."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/08/02", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/293978", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/92676/"], "docs_id": 293978, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When we use 'a large number of' we use a plural verb after it.\n\nA large number of people do this.\n\nWhen we use 'the large number of' we use a singular verb after it.\n\nThe large number of people does this.\n\nWhat about the case when we use 'a large number' without 'of'?\n\n> A large number do it.\n\nOR\n\n> A large number does it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on the context.\n\nIf we say\n\n> A large number do it\n\nwe are implying, from context, an \"of X\" where X is plural.

The goal is to identify whether certain card groupings have advantages when played against opposing hands. As part of my approach (because there are large combinations of selected cards), it is useful to perform segmentation into common groupings.\n\nMy question relates to the symmetry of information since both the \"home\" and \"away\" player are gravitating to common card segment groupings. Here is an illustration of the dataset:\n\n```\nHome_segment     Away_segment     Outcome\n2                4                0\n3                1                1\n7                1                0\n4                2                1\n1                3                0\n...\nn rows\n...\n3                6                1\n1                7                0\n\n```\n\nAs constructed, you'll note that segment 4 appears to have an advantage over segment 2, and if the pattern continued through the data, this would be a useful insight.\n\nMy question, however, is that in creating a predictor using \"home\" and \"away\" in this format, the information contained by the \"reverse perspectives\" appears to be discarded. That is, when segment 4 becomes the home segment, and 2 is the away segment, it seems to me that the prior relationship is not considered in the modelling solution.\n\nShould I effective \"double\" my dataset by reversing the home / away positions?

This way you can deal with symmetry by considering reversed positions as the same combination \\- just count for example (4,2\\) and (2,4\\) together, so you have in total $n(n\\+1\\)/2$ combinations instead of $n^2$, and you get a estimated win probability for each."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is analyzing card game data to predict advantages of certain card groupings.

It addresses the symmetry issue by considering reversed positions (e.g., Home:4, Away:2 and Home:2, Away:4) as the same combination. This reduces the total number of combinations from n^2 to n(n+1)/2, which is more efficient and avoids overparameterization. Using binomial estimation for win probabilities is a straightforward and statistically sound method for this type of data.\n\nOption A would lead to an overparameterized model, as mentioned in the documentation.

As far as I know the data being stored in memory (Either HARD Disk or RAM) is 0s and 1s. \n\nI am sure beyond 0s and 1s there are different ways data being stored in memory devices based on memory device types. \n\nPlease share your ideas about it . \n\nor\n\nWhere can I study about the how data stored in memory devices ? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Digital data is generally stored as 1s and 0s at some level. That is only the view of one level in a large layered hierarchy. Below that you get into charges, phase change of material, mechanical dimples, voltages in active circuits, little regions of magnetic domains, and lots more ways people have come up with over the years to store bits (the 1s and 0s).\n\nAbove the bit layer there is a hierarchy eventually surfaced to applications as a file system by the operating system. There are several layers above the bits and below the file system, but these vary depending on the exact storage device and the file system.\n\nIn general, large storage devices like disks, will present their memory as \"sectors\" or \"blocks\" that are the minimum amount that can be written or erased at once. In flash drives there is a layer that does \"wear leveling\" that swaps around physical blocks to implement the logical blocks presented upwards. Flash blocks have a limited write and erase lifetimes, and this layer seeks to wear them out as evenly as possible. Magnetic disks don't have this issue, but do sometimes have a \"bad spot\" layer that avoids physically defective blocks from the logical blocks presented upwards. Blocks usually contain CRC checksums implemented by the hardware.\n\nThe file system usually deals with the logical blocks directly. It uses some as index to know what it stored in others. Some file systems log operations to aid in recovery. There are lots of strategies for knowing which blocks are used to store the content of which files, which blocks are empty, etc. File systems often add their own checksums to logical blocks or files and other structures.\n\nEventually the file system presents a collection of \"files\" to the operating system. The OS will usually define a few files for its own purposes, then present something a little different to applications. How much different depends on the OS and whether it is intended to deal with multiple possibly hostile processes and other concerns.\n\nEventually the application sees arbitrarily sized collections of data, called files, it can read and write without having to worry about sectors, blocks, or how individual bits are physically stored. Modern file systems tend to present files as named entities in a tree structure."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between digital data storage and physical memory devices?\n\nA) Digital data is always stored directly as 1s and 0s in physical memory devices without any intermediate layers.\n\nB) The physical storage of data in memory devices is completely unrelated to the concept of 1s and 0s used in digital systems.\n\nC) Digital data is represented as 1s and 0s at a high level, but the actual physical storage involves multiple layers and can vary based on the specific memory device technology.\n\nD) All memory devices use the same physical mechanism to store data, regardless of whether they are hard disks, RAM, or flash drives.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the complexity of data storage in modern computer systems. While digital data is indeed represented as 1s and 0s at a conceptual level, the actual physical storage involves multiple layers of abstraction and can vary significantly depending on the type of memory device.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the storage process, ignoring the various intermediate layers and abstractions involved.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests a complete disconnect between digital representation and physical storage, which is not true. The physical storage methods are designed to represent digital data, even if not directly as 1s and 0s.\n\nOption D is incorrect because different types of memory devices (e.g., hard disks, RAM, flash drives) use different physical mechanisms to store data. For example, hard disks use magnetic domains, while flash drives use electrical charges in transistors.\n\nThe correct answer acknowledges that while data is conceptualized as 1s and 0s, the actual storage involves various physical phenomena (such as magnetic domains, electrical charges, or phase changes in materials) and multiple layers of abstraction (like sectors, blocks, wear leveling, and file systems) before reaching the application level."}, "31": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/04/18", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/267529", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/102926/"], "docs_id": 267529, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the Wikipedia article [Diophantine set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_set) there is a section entitled \"Further applications\" in regards to Matiyasevich's theorem and it states:\n\n> Matiyasevich's theorem has since been used to prove that many problems from calculus and differential equations are unsolvable.\n> \n> \n> One can also derive the following stronger form of G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem from Matiyasevich's result:\n\nand then states the theorem.

Akad. Nauk SSSR, 191(2\\): 297\u2013282 (Russian). (English translation, 1970, \u201cEnumerable sets are Diophantine,\u201d Soviet Math. Dokl., 11(2\\): 354\u2013358\\.)\n\nThis is Matiyasevich's solution to Hilbert's 10th problem. How it can be used to obtain a proof to G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem is explained by Torkel Franz\u00e9n ([G\u00f6del's Theorem: An incomplete guide to its use and abuse](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1568812388), 2005, page 73\\).\n\n> Matiyasevich proved that there is no algorithm\n>  that, given a multivariate polynomial $p(x\\_1, x\\_2,...,x\\_k)$ with integer\n>  coefficients, determines whether there is an integer solution to the\n>  equation $p \\= 0$.

Matiyasevich's theorem, which proves that there is no algorithm to determine whether a multivariate polynomial equation with integer coefficients has an integer solution, can be used in conjunction with the properties of sufficiently strong arithmetic systems to arrive at G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem. \n\nIf a system of arithmetic T is \u03c9-consistent and complete, it would be able to prove whether any polynomial equation has a solution or not. This would create an algorithm to determine the solvability of polynomial equations by enumerating proofs in T. However, this contradicts Matiyasevich's theorem, thus showing that T cannot be both complete and \u03c9-consistent. This reasoning provides an alternative path to prove G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Matiyasevich's theorem doesn't directly prove G\u00f6del's theorem; it requires additional reasoning about arithmetic systems. Option B is false as Matiyasevich's theorem actually shows the opposite - that not all Diophantine equations are algorithmically solvable. Option D is incorrect because Matiyasevich's theorem is indeed related to G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem when combined with properties of arithmetic systems."}, "32": {"documentation": {"date": "2023/02/19", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/675776", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/117876/"], "docs_id": 675776, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have given an answer on a question with this MWE, and I am not see an evident hole created when I insert a symbol into an arrow.

It wastes the time of people on the originating site who vote to migrate something which just gets kicked back.

It can do a ton of damage if you level it up and use good arrows, you can start doing damage at enemies that are rushing at you once you've been spotted (the perk that slows down time when you draw is a lifesaver) and you can also increase the sneak attack damage to 3x instead of 2x.

I have found the answer from \"Dierkes, Ulrich; Hildebrandt, Stefan; Tromba, Anthony J. Global analysis of minimal surfaces\", on page 273, Lemma 1, which reads as follows:\n\nLemma: Let $f: U \\\\to \\\\mathbb{H}^2$ be a $C^1$ isometry on an open connected subset $U$ of the hyperbolic plane. Then\n$$\n f(w)\\=\\\\frac{Aw\\+B}{Cw\\+D}, \\\\, A,B,C,D \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R},\n$$\nand $AD\\-BC\\=1$.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The category of **uniform spaces** should fit the bill: $\\\\mathbf R^n$ and $\\\\mathbf R\\_{\\>0}^n$ are homeomorphic, but not uniformly continuously. Here $\\\\mathbf R\\_{\\>0}$ has the uniform structure inherited from the real line, not the one induced by the group structure. (I see now that Noah Schweber made the same suggestion in a comment.)\n\nThat said, I kind of disagree with the premise of the question. I think you can justify writing $M \\\\cong \\\\mathbf R\\_{\\>0}^n$ rather than $M \\\\cong \\\\mathbf R^n$ on account of the first isomorphism being more canonical than the second one. Indeed the first isomorphism is fixed once you've made the choice of an affine patch of $X$ with an isomorphism to $\\\\mathbb G\\_m^n$, whereas the second isomorphism depends in addition on the noncanonical choice of a homeomorphism between $\\\\mathbf R^n$ and $\\\\mathbf R\\_{\\>0}^n$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of hyperbolic geometry, let \u03a9 be a connected domain in the hyperbolic plane H^2, and u: \u03a9 \u2192 H^2 be an orientation-preserving C^1 isometry from \u03a9 to its image. Which of the following statements is true?\n\nA) u can always be extended to a global isometry of H^2\nB) u must be the restriction of a M\u00f6bius transformation in PSL(2,R) to \u03a9\nC) u can be represented as a fractional linear transformation with real coefficients, but not necessarily in PSL(2,R)\nD) u cannot be represented as a fractional linear transformation unless \u03a9 is the entire hyperbolic plane\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the lemma from \"Global analysis of minimal surfaces,\" any C^1 isometry f on an open connected subset U of the hyperbolic plane can be represented as a fractional linear transformation f(w) = (Aw + B)/(Cw + D) with A, B, C, D \u2208 R and AD - BC = 1. This is precisely the definition of a M\u00f6bius transformation in PSL(2,R). Since u is given as an orientation-preserving C^1 isometry on a connected domain \u03a9, it must be the restriction of such a M\u00f6bius transformation to \u03a9.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while u can be extended to a M\u00f6bius transformation, this extension may not be injective on the entire H^2.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the condition AD - BC = 1 ensures that the transformation is in PSL(2,R).\n\nOption D is incorrect because the lemma applies to any open connected subset, not just the entire hyperbolic plane."}, "42": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/01/04", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/311083", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/72572/"], "docs_id": 311083, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: First of all, I've seen [How to prevent mail app from marking e\\-mails from VIP as spam](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/236372/how-to-prevent-mail-app-from-marking-e-mails-from-vip-as-spam) and did the steps.\n\nFor some reason, Mail.app (macOS 10\\.13\\.2\\) thinks perfectly legit mails are junk:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/XuDNb.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/XuDNb.jpg)\n\nThese are mails that I voluntarily opted in to receive.\n\n* I've tried \"Move to Inbox\" on some, but it doesn't help new ones received as junk.\n* The answer at the above link says \"right click the mail and select 'Not Junk'\", there is no such option.\n* I've set my junk filtering as follows:\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9ez3w.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9ez3w.jpg)\n* I've added the sender to my contacts, I can confirm that it's added with its email address.\n* I've also tried replacing the \"From does not contain\" field in the screenshot above with the actual email address of the sender instead of its name.\n* I've added the sender to VIP.\n\nAfter all these, these mails (which for me are important to be notified immediately upon receiving) are still being marked as junk.\n\nAm I missing something obvious, or Mail.app is seriously flawed?

Looking at my rules, I see that when I'm using a \"From\" targeted rule I always use the actual email address, or partial email address, like \"@importantdomain.com.\"\n\nMy suggestion would be to change your last line to a subject rule, so \"Subject does not contain TradingView.\" If that makes the rule work, then there definitely is a problem with the email address in your contact you created for this sender.\n\nAnd not strictly speaking an answer, but I would leave the spam rule for strictly finding spam and then have a separate, higher rule that would look for the \"TradingView\" emails, sort or flag them, then under \"Perform the following actions:\" choose \"Stop evaluating rules.\" That should find the TradingView emails, do what you want with them, then perform no more rule actions on them. A little bit of a different philosophy, but it has worked for me."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A user is having trouble with legitimate emails from TradingView being marked as spam in Mail.app on macOS. Which of the following approaches is most likely to resolve this issue while maintaining proper email organization?\n\nA) Add the sender's name to the \"From does not contain\" field in the junk mail filtering rules\nB) Create a new rule that looks for \"TradingView\" in the subject line, performs desired actions, and stops evaluating further rules\nC) Add the sender to the VIP list in Mail.app\nD) Right-click on the email and select \"Not Junk\"\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because using the sender's name instead of the email address in filtering rules can be unreliable and may not catch all emails from that sender.\n\nOption B is the best solution as it creates a specific rule for TradingView emails that will be evaluated before the spam filter. This approach allows for proper handling of these emails without interfering with general spam filtering.\n\nOption C, while potentially helpful, does not directly address the spam filtering issue and may not be sufficient on its own to prevent emails from being marked as junk.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, according to the user's description, there is no \"Not Junk\" option available when right-clicking on the email. Additionally, this would be a manual process for each email rather than an automated solution.\n\nThe correct approach (B) provides a targeted solution that will catch TradingView emails based on the subject line, allow for custom handling, and prevent them from being evaluated by subsequent rules, including spam filters."}, "43": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/07/09", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/158799", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 158799, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to use Cherokee for my PHP\\-centered site...what distro would best for that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The definitive answer: whichever distro you're most comfortable with.\n\nCase closed."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A web developer is planning to set up a PHP-centered website using the Cherokee web server.

Though sinks usually connect to 1\\-1/2\" pipe, anything below slab level is usually upsized to 2\" for clog avoidance and easier cleaning. You'd reduce it above floor level. It's positioned to be either in the wall or in the cabinet.\n\nThe center is the toilet. 4\" stubs are often used so that you can install an inside (hub) flange, reducing the inlet to a standard 3\" toilet connection. You'd cut it off and install a cement\\-in flange over your flooring. It's positioned to be centered 12\" off your finished wall surface.\n\nThe right one is for a shower. They're typically left with a box around them so you can fine\\-tune position for the pan or tub you select by adding a trap assembly. The pail is simply a concrete form/barrier.\n\nIf you're going to eliminate the shower, just cut the stub below floor level, cap it, and fill in the boxed area with concrete. There's nothing to bust up.\n\n*Disclaimer: Plumbing is like a box of chocolates. You never know.... The pipe on the left could be a vent for the toilet. I'd run some water in each, with them all opened up, and see what you see (or hear).*"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner is renovating their basement and encounters three plumbing rough-ins in the concrete floor.

According to the expert advice, there's no need to break up the existing concrete floor. The shower drain stub can be cut just below floor level, capped, and the boxed area filled with concrete. This method effectively eliminates the unused shower drain while minimizing disruption to the existing floor. Option A is unnecessary and more labor-intensive. Option B leaves an unused opening that could cause issues later. Option D introduces a floor drain that wasn't part of the original plan and may not be necessary or desirable in a powder room setting."}, "46": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/05/24", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/66606", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/23663/"], "docs_id": 66606, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Preface\n=======\n\nI need to buy a new HVAC system for my 1930s home. I currently have forced air duct system. My gas furnace was installed in 1985 and is rusting out, and I'm not sure about the air conditioner.\n\nExperience\n==========\n\nI had a local big name HVAC company come out to give me an estimate. His sizing calculation consisted of going through my home and counting the registers and returns (not every room in my home has returns). He didn't take any measurements of the rooms ... which seemed odd to me. \n\nQuestion\n========\n\nIs there a certain kind of professional that I can hire to inspect my home and design a heating and cooling system ? I think I'd like this person to be different from the person that will be selling the system to me.\n\nQuestions I would like this person to answer:\n\n* What is the correct size system for my home?\n* What is appropriate type of system for my home: heat pump, gas furnace, etc ?\n* Are my existing ducts adequate ?\n* What should I consider when choosing one system over an other?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In theory this is what HVAC professionals are supposed to do. In practice, most of them rely on antiquated rules of thumb to size equipment and use existing ductwork, even if it has major problems. A certified energy rater is who you're looking for and who will be able to definitively tell you what you need to know, but you can learn a lot yourself to be a more informed consumer.\n\nThe correct size of equipment for your home is discovered by doing a Manual J load calculation. You can do an 85% as good approximation yourself in 15 minutes here: <http://www.loadcalc.net>\n\nFor a 1930s house, unless major air sealing, insulation, and window replacement work has taken place, the load may be as high as 1 ton of AC per 500 square feet and 30 heating BTUs per square foot. But those would be worst\\-case scenario numbers; run them yourself with that web tool and get a ballpark estimate of your house's loads.\n\nThe most appropriate type of equipment for your house depends on your climate, your budget, and the fuels available. If you live in a mostly\\-cold climate and have natural gas, then a gas furnace makes the most sense. If you live in a mixed hot\\-and\\-cold climate but it doesn't get *too* cold, then a conventional heat pump may be a good bet. If it gets both very hot and very cold, then AC \\+ a gas furnace may make the most sense if you have gas; if you don't, then a Japanese ducted mini\\-split or conventional heat pump is a better choice.\n\nAs for your existing ducts, it's impossible to say whether they're adequate or not without knowing anything about them. But they may be inadequate if they are in the attic, or if they are in a vented crawlspace, or if any rooms get much hotter or colder and other ones, or if a lot of air leaks out of them.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that you're not really hiring someone to design your home HVAC system; your home already has an HVAC system (well, the \"H\" and \"AC\" parts, at least). If every part of it is unsalvageably wrong, expect to pay mucho dinero to completely replace everything. New equipment and new ductwork and all the demolition and drywall repair entailed by such a job will probably cost you $15k or more... possibly much more if you live in a high\\-labor\\-cost area. Consider how much you actually need to replace and how much you can simply live with, especially considering that many comfort\\-related deficiencies in a house's heating and cooling infrastructure can be ameliorated by improving its insulation and air sealing. There are many such opportunities in an old house, including the extremely low\\-hanging fruit of air\\-sealing the basement, weatherstripping any old windows, and adding more attic floor insulation.\n\nIn general, it's a good idea to do all this work before replacing your equipment, since if you buy correctly\\-sized units now, they will be too big after you perform the work. You can mitigate this to a certain extent by purchasing \"modulating,\" \"variable speed,\" or \"two\\-stage\" units, as they are capable of reducing their output at low\\-load conditions. In theory you won't have to use your furnace for another 4\\+ months at least, so you have some time to tackle those sorts of projects before having to replace it, which will allow you to purchase a smaller one and save money, or a better one for the same price."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An energy-efficient homeowner wants to replace their HVAC system in their 1930s house.

This method involves:\n\n1. Performing a Manual J load calculation to accurately determine the heating and cooling needs of the home.\n2. Improving insulation and air sealing, which are often major issues in older homes. This step can significantly reduce the heating and cooling load of the house.\n3. Installing an appropriately sized HVAC system based on the improved home envelope and accurate load calculations.\n\nThis approach ensures that the new HVAC system is properly sized for the home's actual needs, avoiding oversizing (which can lead to inefficiency and comfort issues) or undersizing (which can result in inadequate heating or cooling). It also addresses underlying efficiency issues in the home, which can lead to long-term energy savings and improved comfort. While this method may require more upfront investment, it typically results in lower operating costs and better performance over time."}, "47": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/05/11", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/206336", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/11640/"], "docs_id": 206336, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let $\\\\mathcal{M}$ be the following category:\n\n* The objects are small abelian categories *with chosen zero object, biproducts, kernels, and cokernels*.\n* The morphisms are functors that preserve the structure *strictly*.\n* Composition and identities are the obvious ones.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, $\\\\mathcal{M}$ is a locally finitely presentable category.

Does this exhibit $\\\\mathfrak{A}$ as the higher\\-categorical localisation of $\\\\mathfrak{M}$ with respect to weak equivalences?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It seems to me that you can answer this question without 2\\-monads. Perhaps 2\\-monads do apply in this example but they might not in similar ones so here is an outline not using them.\n\n(1\\)Yes. More generally consider an adjunction $F\\\\dashv U:M \\\\leftrightarrows Cat$ with M locally presentable as a 2\\-category (just amounts to its underlying category being locally presentable and it has cotensors with the walking arrow 2 \\- equally it is complete as a 2\\-category) and U an accessible right 2\\-adjoint (just means its underlying functor is accessible right adjoint and preserves cotensors with 2, equally all limits).  \n\nThen you get a projectively lifted model structure in which the weak equivalences and fibrations are those whose image under U is one.\nNow M, being complete, has cotensors with the free isomorphism $I$. The objects $X^{I}$ provide functorial path objects for $M$: indeed you get a factorisation of $X \\\\to X \\\\times X$ into an internal equivalence followed by a (discrete) isofibration in any 2\\-category. So according to Proposition 1 on\n[http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/transferred\\+model\\+structure](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/transferred+model+structure)\nyou get a transferred model structure.\n\n(2\\) I haven't checked but I would strongly suspect so. Certainly the relevant condition is true for generating cofibrations and trivial cofibrations (by adjointness) and presumably you can extend from there by general nonsense?\n\n(3\\) This can be seen in a couple of ways. As David Roberts says, you can use Pronk's work on bicategorical localization, and that might be the most direct route. The key point here is that given any weak map $f:A \\\\rightsquigarrow B$ you can cover it by a span of strict maps $(p,q):A \\\\leftarrow P\\_{f} \\\\rightarrow B$ where $p$ is a trivial fibration and $q$ an isofibration such that $fp \\\\cong q$. Here $P\\_{f}$ is the pseudolimit of the arrow $f$ \\- in the $F$\\-categorical sense of Lack and Shulman. It is just the full subcategory of the comma category $B/f$ consisting of the invertible arrows, with the evident structure lifted to $M$.\nIn particular this shows that the inclusion $M \\\\to \\\\mathbf M$ is sufficiently surjective on 1\\-cells that Pronk's Proposition 24 may be applied. Though you would also need to verify the calculus of fractions stuff therein to apply that too.\n\nBeyond this I would point out that a 2\\-functor (or pseudofunctor) $F:M \\\\to C$ sends weak equivalences to equivalences iff it sends trivial fibrations to equivalences (use the above covering $(p,q)$ of a $U$\\-equivalence $f$ by a span of trivial fibrations, just like in Ken Brown's lemma). So $\\\\mathbf M$ is equally the 2\\-categorical localisation at the trivial fibrations.\n\n(3\\*)\nAlthough this property characterises $\\\\mathbf M$ up to biequivalence, there is in fact a stronger property characterising it up to isomorphism. Namely, it is the (2\\)\\-category of weak maps for the algebraic weak factorisation system generated by the lifted generating cofibrations. You can see this using an argument identical similar to the proof of Theorem 16 of [http://arxiv.org/abs/1412\\.6560](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6560)\n\nFrom that you get a Kleisli 2\\-adjunction $Q \\\\dashv j:M \\\\to \\\\mathbf M$ whose counit $QA \\\\to A$ is a trivial fibration. (Actually the awfs stuff only gives you the 1\\-adjunction, but since j preserves cotensors this extends to a unique 2\\-adjunction).\nAnd you could now use an argument identical to that of Theorem 4\\.15 of the paper of Steve Lack mentioned by Alexander Campbell to verify the 2\\-categorical localisation property of Q3\\."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the category $\\mathcal{M}$ of small abelian categories with chosen zero object, biproducts, kernels, and cokernels, and the forgetful functor $U : \\mathcal{M} \\to \\mathbf{Cat}$, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The standard model structure on $\\mathbf{Cat}$ cannot be transferred to $\\mathcal{M}$ under any circumstances.\n\nB) A model structure can be transferred to $\\mathcal{M}$ where weak equivalences and fibrations are created by $U$, but it is not compatible with the $\\mathbf{Cat}$-enrichment.\n\nC) A model structure can be transferred to $\\mathcal{M}$ where weak equivalences and fibrations are created by $U$, and it is compatible with the $\\mathbf{Cat}$-enrichment, resulting in a model 2-category.\n\nD) The forgetful functor $U : \\mathcal{M} \\to \\mathbf{Cat}$ does not preserve limits and filtered colimits, making it impossible to transfer any model structure.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation indicates that a model structure can indeed be transferred to $\\mathcal{M}$ where weak equivalences and fibrations are created by $U : \\mathcal{M} \\to \\mathbf{Cat}$.

Unfortunately the data were gathered with an online app of some sort, and it was not programmed to output the data in the most usable form. \n\nThe pictures below illustrates the basic problem. I was told that this is called a \"Reshape\" or \"Restructure\". \n\nQuestion: What is the best process for going from Picture 1 to Picture 2 with a large data set with over 10k entries?\n\n![This is a sample, the actual file has over 10k entries. I've color coded to help with clarity](https://i.stack.imgur.com/g54tA.jpg)\n\n![This is what it all needs to be converted into.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QitXu.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *As I noted in my [comment](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/104335/excell-dataset-now-sure-where-to-start-advise-please#comment201622_104335), there isn't enough detail in the question for a real answer to be formulated. Since you need help even finding the right terms and formulating your question, I can speak briefly in generalities.* \n\nThe term you are looking for is [data cleaning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing). This is the process of taking raw, poorly formatted (dirty) data and getting it into shape for analyses. Changing and regularizing formats (\"two\" $\\\\rightarrow 2$) and reorganizing rows and columns are typical data cleaning tasks. \n\nIn some sense, data cleaning can be done in any software and can be done with Excel or with R. There will be pros and cons to both choices: \n\n* **Excel:** Excel is almost certainly the most common choice for data cleaning (see R fortunes \\#59 [pdf](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fortunes/vignettes/fortunes.pdf)). It is also considered a poor choice by statisticians. The primary reason is that it is hard to ensure that you have caught everything, or that you have treated everything identically, and there is no record of the changes that you have made, so you can't revisit those changes later. The upside of using Excel is that it will be easier to see what you are doing, and you don't have to know much to make changes. (Statisticians will consider the latter an additional *con*.)\n* **R:** R will require a steep learning curve. If you aren't very familiar with R or programming, things that can be done quite quickly and easily in Excel will be frustrating to attempt in R. On the other hand, if you ever have to do this again, that learning will have been time well spent. In addition, the ability to write and save your code for cleaning the data in R will alleviate the cons listed above. The following are some links that will help you get started with these tasks in R: \n\nYou can get a lot of good information on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): \n\n\t+ [How does one reorder colums in R?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/5620885/1217536)\n\t+ [R: How can I reorder the rows of a matrix, data.frame or vector acording to another one?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/2785998/1217536) \n\n[Quick\\-R](http://www.statmethods.net/) is also a valuable resource: \n\n\t+ [sorting](http://www.statmethods.net/management/sorting.html) \n\nGetting numbers into numerical mode: \n\n\t+ [Convert written number to number in R](https://stackoverflow.com/q/18332463/1217536)\n\t+ [?strtoi](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/strtoi.html) is a specialized function for converting from hexidicimal, etc., if necessary \n\nAnother invaluable source for learning about R is [UCLA's stats help website](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/): \n\n\t+ [working with factor variables](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/modules/factor_variables.htm) (for your \"mostly agree\", etc.) \n\nLastly, you can always find a lot of information with good old Google: \n\n\t+ This search: [data cleaning in r](https://www.google.com/search?q=data%20cleaning%20in%20r&oq=data%20c%20in%20r&gs_l=serp.3.0.0i7i30l9j0i8i7i30.26069.28149.0.31628.6.6.0.0.0.0.409.895.2-2j0j1.3.0.ehm_pq_qw,hmrde=0,hmffs=10,hmffl=3,hmffmp=0-7...0...1.1.47.serp..3.3.892.pSZOyTJGnyo), brings up a number of tutorials (none of which I've worked through, FTR).\n\n---\n\n*Update:* This is a common issue regarding the structure of your dataset when you have multiple measurements per 'study unit' (in your case, a person). If you have one row for every person, your data are said to be in 'wide' form, but then you will necessarily have multiple columns for your response variable, for example. On the other hand, you can have just one column for your response variable (but have multiple rows per person, as a result), in which case your data are said to be in 'long' form. Moving between these two formats is often called 'reshaping' your data, especially in the R world. \n\n* The standard R function for this is [?reshape](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/reshape.html). There is a [guide](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/faq/reshape.htm) to using `reshape()` on UCLA's stats help website.\n* Many people think `reshape` is hard to work with. [Hadley Wickham](https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/46/hadley) has contributed a package called [reshape2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html), which is intended to simplify the process. Hadley's personal website for reshape2 is [here](http://had.co.nz/reshape/), the Quick\\-R overview is [here](http://www.statmethods.net/management/reshape.html), and there is a nice\\-looking tutorial [here](http://seananderson.ca/2013/10/19/reshape.html).\n* There are very many questions on SO about how to reshape data. Most of them are about going from wide to long, because that is typically what data analysts are faced with. Your question is about going from long to wide, which is much less common, but there are still many threads about that, you can look through them with [this search](https://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=votes&q=%5Br%5D%20reshape%20is%3Aquestion%20%22long%20to%20wide%22).\n* If your heart is set on trying to do this with Excel, there is a thread about writing a VBA macro for Excel to replicate the reshape functionality here: [melt / rehshape in Excel using VBA?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/10921791/1217536)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A research assistant is tasked with restructuring a large dataset from a study with over 10,000 entries. The data needs to be transformed from a long format (multiple rows per participant) to a wide format (one row per participant). Which of the following approaches would be most recommended for this task, considering both efficiency and reproducibility?\n\nA) Use Excel's sorting and filtering functions to manually reorganize the data, as it provides a visual interface and is widely accessible.\n\nB) Write a custom VBA macro in Excel to automate the reshaping process, replicating R's reshape functionality.\n\nC) Use R's base reshape() function to transform the data, following guides from statistical resources like UCLA's stats help website.\n\nD) Employ R's reshape2 package, particularly the functions melt() and dcast(), to restructure the data, as it's designed to simplify the reshaping process.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While all options have some merit, option D is the most recommended approach for this task. Using R's reshape2 package, specifically designed to simplify data reshaping, offers several advantages:\n\n1. Efficiency: It can handle large datasets (10,000+ entries) more efficiently than manual Excel methods.\n2. Reproducibility: The R code can be saved and reused, allowing for easy replication or modification of the process.\n3. Reliability: Programmatic approaches reduce the risk of human error compared to manual data manipulation in Excel.\n4. Learning curve: Although R has a steeper learning curve than Excel, the reshape2 package is designed to be more intuitive than base R's reshape() function.\n5. Future value: Learning R and its data manipulation packages has long-term benefits for data analysis tasks.\n\nOption A, while familiar, is prone to errors and not reproducible for large datasets. Option B requires advanced Excel skills and still lacks the robustness of R for data manipulation. Option C is a viable alternative but is generally considered more difficult to use than reshape2. Therefore, option D provides the best balance of efficiency, reproducibility, and long-term value for the research assistant's task."}}
