Both of them are onepage checkout.\nFor both of them I have layout XML file; for B I'm removing many blocks from whole page so it's very simplified.\nI would like to move these changes to one URL, so by some settings there will be displayed checkout A or checkout B randomly.\nHow to force in custom controller changes that I made with layout XML file? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here I am demonstrating what is your current state(According to my understanding) and how to solve your problem.\n\nSo you have basically two controllers that is defined for checkout. The url paths that invoke your controllers then somewhat look like this `www.yoursite.com/index.php/checkout/a` (For controller with name `A`) and `www.yoursite.com/index.php/checkout/b`(For controller with name `B`). I assume `indexAction()` method in your controllers are used to load and render the layouts. They loads their own layouts. Everything is perfect untill here. Now you want to render layout that render by controller B along with layouts of controller A, when `www.yoursite.com/index.php/checkout/a` is requested.\n\nYou can achieve this in two ways (There may be other ways). \n\n* Through an event observer\n* through controller A\n\nThrough an event observer\n=========================\n\nWe are going to listen to the event `controller_action_layout_load_before`. This event will call before any layout loads. We will *inject* the layout of controller B to that of control A. So \n\nConfig.xml\n----------\n\n```\n<config>\n    <frontend>\n        <events>\n            <controller_action_layout_load_before>\n                <observers>\n                    <checkout_controller_action_layout_load_before>\n                        <class>programmerrkt_checkout/observer</class>\n                        <method>controllerActionLayoutLoadBefore</method>\n                    </checkout_controller_action_layout_load_before>\n                </observers>\n            </controller_action_layout_load_before>\n        </events>\n    </frontend>\n</config>\n\n```\n\nObserver\n--------\n\n```\n<?php\nclass Programmerrkt_Checkout_Model_Observer\n{\n        const LAYOUT_HANDLE_TO_CHECK_WITH = 'checkout_a_index';\n        const LAYOUT_HANDLE_TO_ATTACH = 'checkout_b_index';\n        public function controllerActionLayoutLoadBefore(Varien_Event_Observer $observer)\n        {\n            /** @var $layout Mage_Core_Model_Layout_Update */\n            $update = $observer->getEvent()->getLayout()->getUpdate();\n            $handles = $update->getHandles(); //get all handles \n            //If layout handle of controller A is not in action,  will not attach the handles\n            if(in_array(self::LAYOUT_HANDLE_TO_CHECK_WITH , $handles))\n            {\n                $update->addHandle(self::LAYOUT_HANDLE_TO_ATTACH);\n            }    \n        }\n}\n\n```\n\nThrough Controller Method\n=========================\n\nNow we can load layout of controller B through controller A. This is little tricky. This is because we cannot use `loadLayout()` method, if we are planning to use controller for this purpose. Why ? this [THREAD](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3463030/magento-use-own-handle-in-widgets-doesnt-work) gives an answer for that (checkout alanstorm's answer). In short, if we add handle of controller B (`checkout_b_index` in this case), before or after the method `loadLayout()`, its not going to make any difference. So what we need to do is, we need to replace loadLayout() with our codes, so that `checkout_index_b` handle also added to the layout tree of controller A.\n\nSo your controller A should look like this.\n\n```\n public function indexAction()\n{\n    //code follows some what replaces loadLayout() method\n    $update = $this->getLayout()->getUpdate(); \n    $update->addHandle('default'); //attach layout handle of for controller A\n    $this->addActionLayoutHandles(); \n    $update->addHandle('checkout_b_index'); //attach layout handle of controller B\n    $this->loadLayoutUpdates();\n    $this->generateLayoutXml();\n    $this->generateLayoutBlocks();\n    $this->_isLayoutLoaded = true;\n\n    $this->renderLayout();\n}\n\n```\n\nThat's it. Now load the url `www.yoursite.com/index.php/checkout/a`. You can see content of both A and B in there.\n\nCheck my blog for better understanding [http://rajeev\\-k\\-tomy.blogspot.in/2014/06/add\\-layout\\-to\\-another\\-layout.html](http://rajeev-k-tomy.blogspot.in/2014/06/add-layout-to-another-layout.html)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Magento checkout system with two different controllers (A and B) and separate layout XML files, you want to combine their functionality into a single URL that randomly displays either checkout A or B.

As soon as I connect the wires to the transfomer that run to the chime the voltage drops to 2V or so. What would that indicate? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assuming you have a full mains voltage going *into* the transformer, then there is a short\\-circuit in the wiring (or, much less likely, the transformer is vastly underrated for the current drawn).\n\n\"Bell wire\" has thin insulation, compared to mains wiring. A staple may be pinching the wires, or wires could have rubbed together, tearing the insulation. Sometimes mice or squirrels can cause this. Such a short could have burned out the old transformer.\n\nAnother possibility is a short in the chime, which then caused the contacts of the doorbell switch to fuse together.\n\nAlso, inspect your connections to the transformer. If there are multiple wires, e.g. from both a front and a back door switch, they could be misconnected.\n\nIf you can, check the resistance between the bell wires going to the transformer secondary. The resistance should be greater than 16 divided by the current rating of the transformer, or (16 x 16\\) divided by the VA rating. For example, if the transformer is rated 10 VA, then circuit resistance should be greater than 256/10, or \\~26 ohms. (Not to worry if it's just a bit lower, though: you're measuring DC resistance, while AC reactance across a coil is higher.)\n\nDon't be concerned about the 22 VAC *open circuit* output because the *nominal* voltage, 16 VAC, is at the rated load.\n\nBTW, my compliments on checking the voltage on installation! Had you not done so, the transformer would have burned out again, or there is a small possibility of fire if a \"short\\-circuit\" is a few ohms and is by something flammable."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electrician has replaced a doorbell transformer rated for 16V. When measuring the output with no load, they observe 22V. However, upon connecting the wires to the chime, the voltage drops to 2V. Which of the following is the MOST likely explanation for this situation, and what should be the next troubleshooting step?\n\nA) The transformer is faulty and producing excess voltage. Replace the transformer with a properly functioning 16V unit.\n\nB) There is a short circuit in the wiring or chime. Measure the resistance between the bell wires going to the transformer secondary.\n\nC) The chime is drawing too much current. Install a higher-rated transformer to handle the load.\n\nD) The mains voltage input to the transformer is too high. Reduce the input voltage to the transformer.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most likely explanation is a short circuit in the wiring or chime. The 22V reading with no load is normal for a 16V transformer, as the nominal voltage is typically measured at rated load. The dramatic voltage drop when connected suggests a short circuit, not a faulty transformer or incorrect input voltage.\n\nThe next step should be to measure the resistance between the bell wires going to the transformer secondary. This will help identify if there's a short circuit in the wiring or chime. The resistance should be greater than 16 divided by the current rating of the transformer, or (16 x 16) divided by the VA rating. This step will help locate the problem without risking further damage to the new transformer.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are less likely or incorrect approaches given the symptoms described."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/11/15", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/266060", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/123267/"], "docs_id": 266060, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Tom is at a party, hanging at the bar.

You'll need to get filler plate to block off the space since the 120 v breaker will be taking 1 slot whereas the 240 took two.\n\nDepending upon your jurisdiction, only GFCI may be required for outdoor outlets. But AFCI isn't a bad thing. Others here (with more knowledge than me) favor using GFCI breakers in panels rather than GFCI outlets, the reasoning is they are protected from the weather, by being installed in a panel and last a lot longer.\n\nOK, that aside said, moving on: At the box where the old water heater was, run 12/2 from there to your outdoor outlets. Use high quality outlets, not $.79 cheapies.\nYou'll install the white wire that is now the neutral to the GFCI breaker (assuming you go that route), and the white pig\\-tail from the breaker to the neutral bus bar. If you choose to use a GFCI outlet \"first in line\" for your outdoor outlets, you'll need to move the white wire that was formally connected to the water heater breaker to the neutral bus bar. Mark the 10ga wires with a tag saying there is 12ga as part of that circuit. Any decent electrician would probably realize that, but a future homeowner might not. No penalty for clarity!\n\nI'd like to see a pic of the inside of your main panel to see exactly what we are dealing with. Brand and age of panel also helps.

The answer specifies using 12/2 wire from the old water heater box to the new outdoor outlets, which is appropriate for a 20 amp circuit. It also mentions marking the 10 gauge wires to indicate that 12 gauge is part of the circuit, which is an important safety measure. This option follows the guidelines provided in the documentation for repurposing the line safely and effectively.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't change the voltage to 120V, which is needed for standard outlets. Option C is incorrect because it uses the wrong amperage (30 amp instead of 20 amp) for standard outlets and doesn't change the wire gauge.

It is possible to solve your problem exactly, by enumerating the multinomial combinations that satisfy the required inequality, and summing the distribution over that range. In the case where $N$ is large this may become computationally infeasible. In this case it is possible to obtain an approximate distribution using the normal approximation to the multinomial. A generalised version of this approximation is shown below, and then this is applied to your specific example.\n\n---\n\n**General approximation problem:** Suppose we have a sequence of exchangeable random variables with range $1, 2, ..., m$. For any $n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}$ we can form the count vector $\\\\boldsymbol{X} \\\\equiv \\\\boldsymbol{X} (n) \\\\equiv (X\\_1, X\\_2, ..., X\\_m)$, which counts the number of occurences of each outcome in the first $n$ values of the sequence. Since the underlying sequence is exchangeable, the count vector is distributed as:\n\n$$\\\\begin{array}\n\\\\boldsymbol{X} \\\\text{ \\~ Mu}(n, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}) \\& \\& \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta} \\= \\\\lim\\_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\boldsymbol{X}(n)/n.\n\\\\end{array}$$\n\nNow, suppose we have some vector of non\\-negative weights $\\\\boldsymbol{w} \\= (w\\_1, w\\_2, ..., w\\_m)$ and we use these weights to define the linear function:\n\n$$A(n) \\\\equiv \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^m w\\_i X\\_i.$$\n\nSince the weights are non\\-negative, this new quantity is non\\-decreasing in $n$. We then define the number $N(a) \\\\equiv \\\\min \\\\{ n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} \\| A(n) \\\\geqslant a \\\\}$, which is the smallest number of observations required to obtain a specified minimum value for our linear function. We want to approximate the distribution of $N(a)$ in the case where this value is (stochastically) large.\n\n---\n\n**Solving the general approximation problem:** Firstly, we note that since $A(n)$ is non\\-decreasing in $n$ (which holds because we have assumed that all the weights are non\\-negative), we have:\n\n$$\\\\mathbb{P} (N(a) \\\\geqslant n) \\= \\\\mathbb{P} (N(a) \\> n \\- 1\\) \\= \\\\mathbb{P} (A(n\\-1\\) \\< a).$$\n\nHence, the distribution of $N$ is directly related to the distribution of $A$. Assuming that the former quantity is large, we can approximate the distribution of the latter by replacing the discrete random vector $\\\\boldsymbol{X}$ with a continuous approximation from the multivariate normal distribution. This leads to a normal approximation for the linear quantitiy $A(n)$, and we can calculate the moments of this quantity directly. To do this, we use the fact that $\\\\mathbb{E}(X\\_i) \\= n \\\\theta\\_i$, $\\\\mathbb{V}(X\\_i) \\= n \\\\theta\\_i (1 \\- \\\\theta\\_i)$ and $\\\\mathbb{C}(X\\_i, X\\_j) \\= \\-n \\\\theta\\_i \\\\theta\\_j$ for $i \\\\neq j$. With some basic algebra, this gives us:\n\n$$\\\\mu \\\\equiv \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n} A(n)\\\\right) \\= \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^m w\\_i \\\\theta\\_i,$$\n\n$$\\\\sigma^2 \\\\equiv \\\\mathbb{V}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}} A(n)\\\\right) \\= \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^m w\\_i \\\\theta\\_i \\- \\\\left(\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^m w\\_i \\\\theta\\_i\\\\right)^2 \\= \\\\mu (1 \\- \\\\mu).$$\n\nTaking the normal approximation to the multinomial now gives us the *approximate* distribution $A(n) \\\\text{ \\~ N} (n \\\\mu, n \\\\mu (1 \\- \\\\mu))$. Applying this approximation yields:\n\n$$\\\\mathbb{P} (N(a) \\\\geqslant n) \\= \\\\mathbb{P} (A(n\\-1\\) \\< a) \\\\approx \\\\Phi \\\\left(\\\\frac{a \\- (n\\-1\\) \\\\mu}{\\\\sqrt{(n\\-1\\) \\\\mu (1 \\- \\\\mu)}}\\\\right).$$\n\n(The symbol $\\\\Phi$ is the standard notation for the standard normal distribution function.) It is possible to apply this approximation to find probabilities pertaining to the quantity $N(a)$ for a specified value of $a$. This is a basic approximation which has not attempted to incorporate continuity correction on the values of the underlying multinomial count values. It is obtained by taking a normal approximation using the same first two central moments as the exact linear function.\n\n---\n\n**Application to your problem:** In your problem you have probabilities $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta} \\= (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}, \\\\tfrac{1}{6}, \\\\tfrac{1}{3})$, weights $\\\\boldsymbol{w} \\= (0, \\\\ln 2, \\\\ln 3\\)$, and cut\\-off value $a \\= \\\\ln 100000$. You therefore have (rounding to six decimal points) $\\\\mu \\= \\\\tfrac{1}{6}\\\\ln 2 \\+ \\\\tfrac{1}{3}\\\\ln 3 \\= 0\\.481729$. Applying the above approximation we have (rounding to six decimal points):\n\n$$\\\\mathbb{P}(N(a) \\\\geqslant 25\\) \\\\approx \\\\Phi \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\ln 100000 \\- 24 \\\\cdot 0\\.481729}{\\\\sqrt{24} \\\\cdot 0\\.499666}\\\\right) \\=\\\\Phi (\\-0\\.019838\\) \\= 0\\.492086\\.$$\n\nBy application of the exact multinomial distribution, summing over all combinations satisfying the requirement $\\\\mathbb{P}(A(24\\) \\< a)$, it can be shown that the exact result is $\\\\mathbb{P}(N(a) \\\\geqslant 25\\) \\= 0\\.483500$. Hence, we can see that the approximation is quite close to the exact answer in the present case.\n\nHopefully this answer gives you an answer to your specific question, while also placing it within a more general framework of probabilistic results that apply to linear functions of multinomial random vectors. The present method should allow you to obtain approximate solutions to problems of the general type you are facing, allowing for variation in the specific numbers in your example."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A fair six-sided die is rolled repeatedly.

The new Inbox icon is designed to resemble a physical wire mesh inbox tray, commonly used in office settings to organize papers and documents. This design choice is effective for several reasons:\n\n1. Familiarity: Many users are familiar with the concept of a physical inbox, making the digital representation intuitive and easily recognizable.\n\n2. Skeuomorphism: By using a real-world object as inspiration, the icon leverages skeuomorphic design principles, which can help users quickly understand the function of the digital feature.\n\n3.

In GeoNetwork, use the \"Copy/Paste\" option with \"none\" as the selected stylesheet\n   5. Click \"Insert\" button\n\nB) 1. Edit metadata using Item Description in ArcCatalog\n   2. Use Esri Metadata Translator tool with ARCGIS2FGDC.xml translator\n   3. Open output file in text editor and copy content\n   4. In GeoNetwork, use \"Copy/Paste\" option with \"none\" as the selected stylesheet\n   5. Click \"Insert\" button\n\nC) 1. Change ArcGIS Metadata Style to FGDC CSDGM\n   2. Edit metadata in ArcCatalog\n   3. Open XML file created by ArcGIS and copy content\n   4. In GeoNetwork, use \"Copy/Paste\" option with FGDC stylesheet\n   5. Click \"Insert\" button\n\nD) 1. Edit metadata using Item Description in ArcCatalog\n   2. Export metadata using ArcGIS default translator\n   3. Import the exported file directly into GeoNetwork\n   4. Select appropriate stylesheet in GeoNetwork\n   5. Click \"Import\" button\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct sequence for transferring metadata using the ArcGIS Item Description Style method is described in option B. This process involves editing metadata in ArcCatalog, using the Esri Metadata Translator tool with the ARCGIS2FGDC.xml translator, copying the content of the output file, and then using the \"Copy/Paste\" option in GeoNetwork with no stylesheet selected. This method ensures proper conversion and transfer of metadata from ArcGIS to GeoNetwork.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses the wrong translator (ARCGIS2ISO19139.xml instead of ARCGIS2FGDC.xml). Option C describes the process for using FGDC CSDGM Metadata, which is a different method. Option D is incorrect as it suggests directly importing the exported file into GeoNetwork, which is not the process described in the documentation."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/06/16", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/151633", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/44913/"], "docs_id": 151633, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is the WAN IP of an ADSL modem likely to remain the same if it is not rebooted?\n\nDo ISPs change the WAN IP of an ADSL connection while in session (ie. prior to reboot) ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Likely, yes.

Double\\-quoting your strings (including strings with variables) will cause them to be treated as a single token. Otherwise they will be treated as white\\-space delimited lists of tokens. This applies even if the white\\-space occurs after [parameter\\-expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html) \\- as is happening in your situation.\n\nFor further discussion on why this is important see the following post:\n\n* [Why does my shell script choke on whitespace or other special characters?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/131766/why-does-my-shell-script-choke-on-whitespace-or-other-special-characters)\n\nHere is what your script should probably look like:\n\n```bsh\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"Checking File Copy\"\n\nSRC_DIR=\"/home/user/src\"\n\necho \"Source Directory: ${SRC_DIR}\"\n\nTGT_DIR=\"/media/user/tgt\"\n\necho \"Target Directory: ${TGT_DIR}\"\n\ncd \"${SRC_DIR}\"\n\nfor file_name in *.txt\ndo\n echo \"${file_name}\"\n sum \"${TGT_DIR}/${file_name}\"\n sum \"${file_name}\"\ndone\n\n```\n\nYou'll notice that I've quoted the strings as well as the variables. Strictly speaking this isn't really necessary here, but it's probably good to get in the habit of quoting everything that you want to consider as a single token.\n\nI also used the curly\\-brace syntax for your variables. Again, this probably isn't necessary in this exact situation, but I would consider it a best\\-practice in general. For further discussion regarding the brace syntax see the following post:\n\n* [When do we need curly braces around shell variables?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8748831/when-do-we-need-curly-braces-around-shell-variables)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following modifications to the script would correctly handle filenames with spaces while calculating checksums?\n\nA) Replacing \n   sum $TGT_DIR/$tgt_file\n   sum $file_name\nwith\n   sum \"$TGT_DIR/$tgt_file\"\n   sum \"$file_name\"\n\nB) Keeping the original escaping method:\n   tgt_file=${file_name// /\\\\ }\n   sum $TGT_DIR/$tgt_file\n   sum $file_name\n\nC) Using single quotes instead:\n   sum '$TGT_DIR/$file_name'\n   sum '$file_name'\n\nD) Wrapping the entire for loop in quotes:\n   for file_name in \"*.txt\"\n   do\n     echo \"$file_name\"\n     sum \"$TGT_DIR/$file_name\"\n     sum \"$file_name\"\n   done\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: Option A is correct because it uses double quotes around the variables, which preserves spaces and special characters in filenames. This follows the best practice of quoting variables to treat them as single tokens.\n\nOption B is incorrect because escaping spaces manually is unnecessary and can lead to errors.\n\nOption C is incorrect because single quotes prevent variable expansion, so the actual paths wouldn't be used.\n\nOption D is incorrect because quoting the wildcard pattern \"*.txt\" would prevent it from expanding to match files, and the loop would only run once with the literal string \"*.txt\" as the filename."}, "24": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/07/06", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/160070", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/81511/"], "docs_id": 160070, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to use a Neural Network to predict financial time series.

Since they (quote from the wikipedia link on RNN cited before):\n\n> At each time step, the input is propagated in a standard feed\\-forward fashion, and then a learning rule is applied. The fixed back connections result in the context units always maintaining a copy of the previous values of the hidden units (since they propagate over the connections before the learning rule is applied). Thus the network can maintain a sort of state, allowing it to perform such tasks as **sequence\\-prediction** that are beyond the power of a standard multilayer perceptron.\n\naren't in practice the same as Time Delay Neural Networks? If not, which are the differences with Time Delay Neural Networks? Are both suitable to use with Time Series or which one is more suitable?\n\nThanks beforehand!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have never worked with recurrent networks, but from what I know, in practice, some RNN and TDNN can be used for the same purpose that you want: Predict time series values. However, they work different.\n\nIt is possible with TDNN:\n\n* Predict process' values\n* Find a relationship between two processes.\n\nSome RNN, like [NARX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_autoregressive_exogenous_model) also allow you to do that, and it is also used to predict financial time series, usually better than TDNN.\n\nA TDNN looks more like a feedforward network, because time aspect is only inserted through its inputs, unlike NARX that also needs the predicted/real future value as input. This characteristic makes TDNN less robust than NARX for predicting values, but requires less processing and is easier to train.\n\nIf you are trying to find a relationship between a process $X(t)$ and a process $Y(t)$, NARX requires you to have past values of $Y$, while TDNN does not.\n\nI recommend reading Simon Haykin's Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation (2nd Edition) and this [FAQ](ftp://ftp.sas.com/pub/neural/FAQ.html).

So how does the grounding help?\nAlso, what is the potential of the case during regular times (I thought it it probably 0\\) and during faulty times (thought it is Vphase, beacuse now Vphase is directly connected to it) ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two scenarios. The resistance of the phase is low or the resistance of the phase is high.\n\nIf the resistance of the phase is low, a ground connection will trip the protection device. Protection devices with a dead short are typically very fast.\n\nIn the case that the phase has enough resistance that the protection device does not trip things get a bit more complicated. Suppose the feed is 120V and the protection device is 15A. The resistance of the feed will need to be at minimum 8ohms to keep the protection device from tripping. A good ground resistance will be sub 1ohm. We can calculate the voltage drop using those numbers. 120\\*(1/(8\\+1\\)) \\= 13V. About 13V would appear on the case worst\\-case scenario.\n\nFinally the human touching the case. The resistance of the human body varies but 1500ohms is a good worst\\-case scenario. If we put 1500ohms in parallel with 1ohm the current divider gives us about 10mA. That is considered a bad shock but not lethal. This is far reduced when the resistance of the ground is lower.\n\nSomething that I want to note; is that the case of the phase having enough resistance not trip the protection is highly unlikely.

Attached is the link my fiddle <http://jsfiddle.net/olichalmers/5csofnhz/1/> \n\n```\nvar homeNav = function () {\n    var tgt = $(this);\n\n    $(\"#homeImageNav a \").hoverIntent({\n        over: homeNavOver,\n        out: homeNavOff,\n        interval: 0\n    });\n\n    function homeNavOver() {\n\n        var tgt = $(this);\n        var bgHold = $(\"#bgHolder\");\n        var bg = tgt.attr('data-bg');\n\n        if (!tgt.hasClass('current')) {\n            TweenMax.set($(\"#bgHolder\"), {\n                opacity: 0,\n                background: bg,\n                scale: 1.1\n            });\n            TweenMax.to(bgHold, 1.5, {\n                opacity: 1,\n                scale: 1,\n            });\n        }\n        //tgt.addClass('current');\n    }\n\n    function homeNavOff() {\n        //if (tgt.hasClass('current')) {\n        //tgt.removeClass('current');\n        //}\n    }\n};\n\n```\n\nAnd here is the homeNav function. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You just need to make changes in your function \\- homeNavOff like this:\n\n```\nfunction homeNavOff() {\n    $('#homeImageNav a').removeClass('current');\n    $(this).addClass('current');\n}\n\n```\n\nSee it in action on this [fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/5csofnhz/3/ \"here\")"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a navigation menu using hoverIntent and TweenMax for animations, you want to prevent the hover animation from repeating on the currently selected element. Which of the following code snippets would you add to the homeNavOff function to achieve this behavior?\n\nA) \n```javascript\nfunction homeNavOff() {\n    $(this).toggleClass('current');\n}\n```\n\nB) \n```javascript\nfunction homeNavOff() {\n    $('#homeImageNav a').removeClass('current');\n    $(this).addClass('current');\n}\n```\n\nC)\n```javascript\nfunction homeNavOff() {\n    if (!$(this).hasClass('current')) {\n        $(this).addClass('current');\n    }\n}\n```\n\nD)\n```javascript\nfunction homeNavOff() {\n    $('#homeImageNav a').addClass('current');\n}\n```\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the correct implementation to prevent repeating animations on the currently selected element. Here's why:\n\n1. It first removes the 'current' class from all navigation items using $('#homeImageNav a').removeClass('current'). This ensures that only one item can be 'current' at a time.\n\n2. It then adds the 'current' class to the item that was just hovered over using $(this).addClass('current'). This marks the last interacted item as current.\n\n3. This approach allows the script to track the currently selected item, and the homeNavOver function can check for the 'current' class to decide whether to animate or not.\n\nOption A incorrectly uses toggleClass, which would add and remove the class on alternate hovers. Option C only adds the class if it's not already there, but never removes it from other items. Option D incorrectly adds the 'current' class to all navigation items instead of just the hovered one."}, "39": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/10/02", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/1366954", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/1459438/"], "docs_id": 1366954, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Hi want to create a new user in Ubuntu that is same as root who can login using SSH keys, the only difference is the username.

So if you want to set up a user name that can act fully as root, you can in principle make a different login name for the root user. One of the reasons why it is extremely imprudent to log in as root by default is that human error easily can cause breakage of the entire system."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator wants to create a new user in Ubuntu with the same privileges as root, but with a different username.

It's not a recommended practice (ruling out A), it is possible contrary to B, and it doesn't require sudo as stated in the question (ruling out D). The correct answer is C, as it accurately reflects the possibility of creating such a user while emphasizing the associated risks and the fact that it's not recommended."}, "40": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/18", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/214682", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/13965/"], "docs_id": 214682, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n```\nfrom shapely.geometry import MultiLineString\ncoords = [((0, 0), (3, 3)), ((-1, 0), (1, 0))]\nlines = MultiLineString(coords)\npt1 = lines.interpolate(1)\npt2 = lines.interpolate(2)\n\n```\n\nHow would I find the distance, along the line, between these two points?

"answer": "Here's a challenging multi-choice question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A MultiLineString geometry consists of two line segments: LINESTRING (0 0, 3 3) and LINESTRING (-1 0, 1 0). Two points are interpolated on this MultiLineString: pt1 at distance 0.5 and pt2 at distance 1.0. Which of the following statements is correct regarding these interpolated points?\n\nA) pt1 and pt2 will be on different line segments of the MultiLineString\nB) The Euclidean distance between pt1 and pt2 will be equal to 0.5\nC) pt1 and pt2 will both be located on the LINESTRING (0 0, 3 3)\nD) The MultiLineString distance between pt1 and pt2 (following the geometry) will be less than the Euclidean distance between them\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nWhen using the interpolate() method on a MultiLineString, it only considers the first line segment in the collection.

Consequently, the probability amplitude for the combined system evolving from (\u03c61,\u03c81) to (\u03c62,\u03c82) can be expressed as the product of individual probability amplitudes: \u27e8\u03c62,\u03c82|\u03c61,\u03c81\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c62|\u03c61\u27e9\u27e8\u03c82|\u03c81\u27e9.

If the connections between the capacitors have low resistance then there is a rapidly changing current when the capacitors are connected. This creates a rapidly changing magnetic field and this is where the energy is lost. If the connections have high resistance then the current changes slowly, but this time energy is lost as heat in the resistive connections.\n2. Since the left side of the capacitors is at one voltage and the right side is at a different voltage, the capacitors are in parallel. If you want to connect them in series then you would have to introduce a voltage source (such as a battery) between the capacitors on one side of the circuit.\n3.

This is true even if the connecting wires have very low resistance. The capacitors, being connected in parallel, will equalize their voltages. Option A is incorrect because the energy loss isn't solely due to resistance heating. Option C is wrong because mechanical work isn't the primary loss mechanism, and the voltages will equalize.

Using Group Policy: The documentation provides information on using GPO to \"forbid the possibility to link an account to a Microsoft account.\" This prevents future occurrences.\n\nOption A is incorrect because changing the local password doesn't unlink a Microsoft account.\nOption C is incorrect because the documentation indicates you can't unlink an account without being logged in as that user.\nOption D is incorrect as there's no mention of remote unlinking by Microsoft support or using software restriction policies for this purpose."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/08/15", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/101316", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/4099/"], "docs_id": 101316, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There seem to be a lot of developers who write their SQL by capitalising the keywords:\n\n```\nSELECT column\nFROM table\n     INNER JOIN table\n     ON condition\nWHERE condition\nGROUP BY clause\nHAVING condition\n\n```\n\nI'm wondering why people stick to this approach?

In my native language it is something like \"How can I serve you?\", but this sounds to me excessively submissive \\-\\- in fact I am not their servant; maybe \"In what way can I help you?\" ?; but this sounds to me too specific, as offering some service, i.e., as asking for being assigned a specific task, so that a natural expected answer to such a question understood too literally could be \"two mugs of beer, please\" (once in such a situation I got an answer \"send me money\" \\-\\- I guess it was a joke ridiculing the literal meaning of my question ) ; instead, I want to make it clear that my reply is just a generic polite formula with no literal meaning, i.e., I want to be nice to them, but not to offer my service really.\n\nFor example, if somebody messages me with a \"Hi :)\", an answer that I might expect to such a polite question that I am looking for, could be \"professor, I am interested in studying PhD in your Lab under your guidance\" or \"I want to publish a paper in your journal\", if this is the case i.e., if this was the motivation (subject / topic) of their contacting me. \\-\\- not \"send me money\" or \"two cups of coffee, please\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends very much on the situation. Responses suggesting *service* are appropriate, if they come from a representative of a business or organisation to a private citizen. They are not a good choice in the other direction. Between private citizens, they used to be much more common, when one might ask for the other\u2019s hospitality. But that is rare these days.\n\nA less formal **\u201cwhat can I do for you?\u201d** is perhaps the only response of this sort that I would think is still typical. It implies that the speaker is ready and willing to have some of their time taken up by this unexpected enquiry.\n\n**\u201cCan I help you?\u201d** is also an option, but I find that outside of a business context, it often has a negative connotation: \u201cyou clearly have a problem\u201d, or even \u201cyou\u2019re causing *me* problems, so I\u2019ll \u2018help\u2019 you to go away\u201d. (Within a business context, it\u2019s generally fine: you can suggest that customers have a problem, *if* it\u2019s the sort of problem you\u2019re in business to solve!)\n\nPoliteness in English often takes the form of being indirect. Many questions can be made (more) polite by *asking if you can ask*. So instead of \u201cwhat is this about?\u201d (direct; not actually rude, but not trying to be polite either), you can say **\u201ccan I ask what this is about?\u201d** (\u201cMay\u201d instead of \u201ccan\u201d is slightly more formal.)\n\nIf the situation is very informal, a typical response would be to simply invite them to talk: **\u201cYes?\u201d** or **\u201cgo ahead.\u201d** (\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d falls into this category too, but is probably friendlier than you want to be with a stranger.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a professional setting, a stranger approaches you with a simple \"Hello!\" What is the most appropriate response to politely inquire about their purpose without sounding overly submissive or implying that you're offering a specific service?\n\nA) \"How can I serve you?\"\nB) \"What do you want from me?\"\nC) \"Can I ask what this is about?\"\nD) \"Two mugs of beer, please!\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C, \"Can I ask what this is about?\" is the most appropriate response in this situation.

To prevent concurrent users from editing the same table row (stale record scenarios) we use a row identifier and row version field in the table.

In order to reuse code the read api was designed to return the row id and row version values from the database so that the same values could be passed in the adjust api to identify a row in the table. So if a user wants to edit rows in a table, he needs to first fetch it using the read api to get the row id \\& row version for each row.

You can have different users editing the same data item at one time. There are 2 solutions to it:\n\n**Optimistic locking**: This is pretty much what you have implemented, using a version number on each data item. When you save your data item after editing, you check that the version number in the database is still the one you have loaded. If it's not, it means someone has updated the item in the meantime, so you will show an error message to the user, and they will have to reload the data item and reapply their changes.\n\nThis solution works well for cases when the probability of concurrent change is small, and for when the changes to an item are relatively small, i.e. the user would not lose a couple hours of work if someone changed their edited data item.\n\nEdited: To be more specific to your actual case: I don't see a problem with exposing version numbers, as they are not confidential information. You would return them as part of the edited row so there wouldn't be any performance impact either. \n\nDepending on how public your API is, and how much you trust your clients, you could work around revealing IDs and Versions it by creating temporary aliases, and storing them in a table or cache. So the client would get ID abcd, which internally to you maps to Database ID 1 and version ID 3\\. However you'd have to do this whenever you return a list of records to the client, from which they would choose which one they want to edit, so it would be a big overhead.\n\n**Pessimistic locking**: You would implement a lock service, and would call it to obtain a lock on your data item before being able to edit it. After saving you would release the lock. This means that only one user can edit the item at one time. \n\nHowever it comes with certain drawbacks. For one you need to implement the lock service, then you have to implement some timeout mechanism, for the case that someone starts editing something and then goes home or on holiday. You might also need a way for an administrator to release locks manually on data items, if there are locks waiting for a timeout, but the users need to work on them urgently."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A web application allows users to edit records through both a UI and web services.
