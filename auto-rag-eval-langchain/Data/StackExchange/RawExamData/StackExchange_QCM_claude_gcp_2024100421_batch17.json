The error occurs because Elastic Beanstalk cannot find the .runtimeconfig.json file in the expected location within the zip file. To resolve this, the contents of the folder containing the .runtimeconfig.json file should be zipped directly, rather than zipping the entire folder itself. This ensures that the required file is at the root level of the zip archive, allowing Elastic Beanstalk to properly detect and use it during deployment.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the error message indicates the file is missing, not corrupted or incorrect.

What strategies can I use to defeat enemy heroes?\n\nI do the basics: get last hit to get cash and that's pretty much all I know. I buy the trent boots which are set to agility. The first two things I buy are a courier and the reg with \\+5 hp regen. I then get that sword with critical hits and upgrade it after getting demon's edge.\n\nI still suck and can't kill enemy heroes even though I have \\+130 damage (or more). What can I do?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Nevermore is actually one of the more powerful heroes there are a couple things you should know about him:\n\nStaying alive: Nevermore's damage is largely proportional to how many last hits you got since you last died. So stay alive! You're going to need Lother (which turns your invisible) or Kelen's (which teleports you) to do this, so after boots (str or phase) this is your first pick up.\n\nCombo: because you have 3 shadowrase, you need to cast it more than once to kill. Figure out the middle range usage (hint its the same range as your basic attack) and then follow up with short (if he comes after you) or long (if he runs away). You can also combo it to get more kills.\n\nRequim: This skill trades on being right next to your target, so combo it with Lother or Kelen's for maximum effectiveness.\n\nAbility build:\n\n1. Necromasty (to start grouping up your last hits)\n2. Shadowraze (lvl 1 isn't great, so hold off on it\n3. Shadowraze (Your combo is starting to get good)\n4. Necromasty\n5. Shadowraze (by now your combo is leathal)\n6. Requim\n7. Shadowraze\n8. Necromasty\n9. Necromasty\n10\\+ you want to max out Requim then Presence of the Dark lord\n\nDamage: Most of your early game kills revolve around Shadowraze, but once you get to mid game you're going to want to pick up some dps. Demons Edge is very nice, as is Manta Style (with bonus to survive). Stygian is going to be essential in late game as it stacks with your Presence. Nevermore doesn't trade on his life steal, but Mask of Madness' on use ability is nasty. I usually go for Demon's Edge \\-\\> Stygian \\-\\> Buriza. If you're still looking for items after that Skadi or Satanic are both good, but you should be in end game by then.\n\n---\n\nOk, it sounds like you have a larger problem than working well with Nevermore, that extends to DotA in general. \n\nA carry is a late game hero who can push a lane and take out 3\\-4 opposing heroes with little support. A Hard carry is a character who needs to farm up all game specifically for late game. A Soft carry is a player who doesn't have a ton of late game abilities but can become very powerful late game due to ganking.\n\nGanking is a term for going into an ally's lane and helping to kill their enemy. This technique usually relies on surprise and coordination. Ganking is useful for all heroes as nearby heroes split the xp of a kill and the last hit gains significant gold. Agility based heroes usually operate as glass cannons early on, so ganking is a way to gain experience and gold with minimal risk (the risk usually being getting ganked).\n\nNevermore's ganking technique usually relies on casting shadowraze back to back. Ideally you can get an ally to stun the target and there fore get off all 3 shadowraze. Once you hit level 6, if you have full Necromasty use your lothar's to get right on top of an opponent and Ult. Follow this up immediately with shadowraze (remember to attack first so you're pointed in the right direction, but don't wait for the attack to go off). The target should be low and try to run. Just dps him down till he's in range of your next shadowraze and enjoy the kill.\n\nFarming is another technique to get to late game with an agility hero. Nevermore is especially good at farming in his own lane (known as laning) because of shadowraze. Adjust your range to be ideal for mid\\-range shadowraze (you can do this by attacking). Wait till the last one of your melee creeps is about to die then cast shadowraze. This should kill some of them and injure the rest. When they come into melee range your second shadowraze will finish them off. This is excellent farming technique, but very mana intensive so stock up on consumables."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided DotA documentation:\n\nQuestion: In DotA, when playing as Nevermore, which of the following strategies is NOT recommended for effective gameplay?\n\nA) Prioritizing staying alive to maintain damage output from Necromasty\nB) Using Shadowraze in combination with other abilities for maximum effect\nC) Rushing Demon's Edge as the first major item purchase\nD) Utilizing Lothar's or Kelen's Dagger for positioning and survival\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct because the documentation emphasizes the importance of staying alive to maintain Nevermore's damage output, which is tied to last hits since the last death.\n\nB is correct as the documentation describes using Shadowraze in combinations for effective kills and farming.\n\nC is incorrect.

You could alternatively use raw PKCS\\#7 could be used without any S/MIME wrapping, perhaps using `openssl smime -pk7out`, which takes a S/MIME message and outputs a PKCS\\#7 `signedData` structure.\n\n```\nopenssl smime -sign | openssl smime -pk7out | openssl asn1parse -i\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: When designing an API that requires encrypted messages to be signed and sent over TLS, which of the following is the most appropriate standard format to use for sending the signed and encrypted data as an HTTP POST body?\n\nA) Raw PGP format with ASCII-armored message and signature blocks\nB) S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)\nC) Raw PKCS#7 without any wrapping\nD) Custom format with base64-encoded ciphertext and signature\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) While PGP is a common encryption and signing standard, the raw PGP format is typically used for email and may not be ideal for HTTP-based APIs. Additionally, the question states that GnuPG/PGP cannot be relied upon due to unknown library support.\n\nB) This is the correct answer. S/MIME is a standard for securing MIME data, not just email. It can be used with HTTP as both use similar MIME formats and header syntax. S/MIME provides a standardized way to package signed and encrypted data, making it suitable for use in APIs.\n\nC) While raw PKCS#7 could potentially be used, it lacks the standardized structure and metadata that S/MIME provides, which can be helpful in API contexts.\n\nD) Although a custom format could work, it's generally better to use established standards when possible. A custom format may lack features and could be more difficult for other developers to work with.\n\nS/MIME offers a standardized, well-documented approach that is compatible with HTTP and provides the necessary security features for signing and encrypting data in an API context."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/06/06", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/21106", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/3912/"], "docs_id": 21106, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm currently using a Joyent Accelerator to host my webapps, and it's working fine, however I need to reduce costs so I'm downgrading my current plan and that imposes some new memory limits (256M rss, 512M swap).

For example one might take first the largest prime divisor and then the smallest (when starting with a non\\-prime).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As defined, $d \\\\geq b$ , so iterating $F$ will lead to a fixed point $qr$, a product of a prime $q$ which is no larger than any prime factor of $r$ and such that $(r\\+1\\)$ is $q$\\-smooth. Most of the time, $F(a)$ will be odd, and often will be smaller than $a$ by an amount at least as large as $\\\\sqrt{a}$. This suggests the period of $a$ is $O(\\\\sqrt{a})$, and probably the period is much smaller.\n\nAs $a$ decreases by even numbers, I expect $b$ to be small with a frequency about as expected, meaning that about 7/15 of the values of $b$ will be 3 or 5\\. A nice quantity to know is $\\\\mid \\\\{ a \\\\leq n: F(a)\\=a\\\\}\\\\mid/n$, the density of fixed points. This will likely be near 1/average length of period, but that is another guess. They will be at least as dense as somewhat smooth numbers: for numbers $c$ whose largest prime factor is $q$ and have many small prime factors, $c\\-q$ will often be a fixed point for $F$.\n\nGuy's book Unsolved Problems In Number Theory has problems involving iterated number theoretic functions.

Let $y\\\\in Y(1\\)$ be a $\\\\QQ$\\-point, then the fiber $Y(N)\\_y$ of $Y(N)$ above $y$ is a $\\\\QQ$\\-algebra $A$ of degree $d\\_N :\\= \\|PSL(2,\\\\ZZ/N)\\|$. Since $Y(N)/Y(1\\)$ is galois, we find that $A \\= \\\\prod\\_{i\\=1}^{k\\_y} K\\[x]/(x^e)$ is a product of $k\\_y$\\-many connected $\\\\QQ$\\-algebras, where $e \\= 1$ if $y\\\\ne 0, 1728$, otherwise $e \\= 3,2$ if $y \\= 0,1728$. Here we have $k\\_y\\\\cdot e\\\\cdot\\[K:\\\\QQ] \\= d\\_N$. Note that by the Weil Pairing $K$ must contain a primitive $N$th root of unity $\\\\zeta\\_N$.\n\nThus, we find that for any such $y$, there exists a field $K$ of degree over $\\\\QQ$ dividing $d\\_N$ such that there exists a $K$\\-point on $Y(3\\)$ lying above $y$. This means, that there exists an elliptic curve $E/K$ with a pair of points $P,Q\\\\in E(K)\\[N]$ which generate $E\\[N]$ and such that $e\\_N(P,Q) \\= \\\\zeta\\_N$. In particular, $E\\[N]$ is defined over $K$. Note that given one such pair $(P,Q)$ there exist $SL\\_2(\\\\ZZ/N)$\\-many such pairs with Weil pairing $\\\\zeta\\_N$, whose equivalence classes modulo $Aut(E)$ occupy all of the points in the fiber $Y(3\\)\\_y$ (ie, over $y\\\\ne 0,1728$ there are $d\\_N$ such equivalence classes. Otherwise there are $\\\\frac{d\\_N}{3}$ or $\\\\frac{d\\_N}{2}$ if $y \\= 0$ or $1728$).\n\nThe fact that all the points of $Y(3\\)\\_y$ is taken up by this single curve $E$ means that there is (up to $K$\\-isomorphism), precisely one elliptic curve $E$ with $E\\[N]$ defined over $K$ (this is the *special twist* I was referring to in the OP).

Fund. Math., 78(3\\):193\u2013203, 1973\\. \n\nActually, there is a very interesting mathematical story here, and several problems. \n\nThe question was first asked about uncountable sets of reals and $\\\\omega\\_1$. Quickly, it was recognized to be a problem about what we now call non\\-special orders. $L$ is *non\\-special* iff $L\\\\to(\\\\omega)^1\\_\\\\omega$, meaning that if $L$ is split into countably many pieces, at least one is not reverse\\-well\\-ordered, i.e., it contains a strictly increasing sequence. Baumgartner and Hajnal proved that $L\\\\to(\\\\alpha)^2\\_n$ for any countable ordinal $\\\\alpha$ and $n\\<\\\\omega$.\n\n(In human: If L is non\\-special, and to each subset of $L$ of size 2 we assign a color, there being only finitely many colors to begin with, then for any countable ordinals $\\\\alpha$ there is a subset of $L$ order isomorphic to $\\\\alpha$, all of whose 2\\-sized subsets are assigned the same color.)\n\nTheir original proof uses Martin's axiom, as it depends on a kind of diagonalization over certain functions $f:\\\\omega\\\\to\\\\omega$ and one needs that if there are not \"too many\" of them, then there is one dominating all. This is to my mind the key use of MA in their paper, although there is another one. Then one argues that being special is preserved by ccc forcing and that the conclusion is absolute.\n\nGalvin later found a very nice combinatorial argument that avoids forcing. Clinton Conley recently found a similar proof. It rests on a kind of abstract Fubini theorem, the point being that the special linear sub\\-orders of a non\\-special $L$ form a proper $\\\\sigma$\\-complete ideal. Galvin noticed that the result should hold in a more general setting, and conjectured that that's the case.\n\nThe conjecture was later proved by Stevo Todorcevic: $P\\\\to(\\\\alpha)^2\\_n$ holds if $P$ is non\\-special, but it suffices that $P$ is a partial order, rather than a linear order. Stevo's beautiful argument proceeds by three stages:\n\n1. To each $P$ we can associate a certain tree; if $P$ is non\\-special, so is the tree (in the usual sense of non\\-special, hence the name), and the result holds for $P$ iff it does for the tree. This is a direct combinatorial argument, but it is very general (not just for colorings of pairs). For example, it simplifies the proof that $P\\\\to(\\\\omega)^1\\_\\\\omega$ implies $P\\\\to(\\\\alpha)^1\\_\\\\omega$ for any $\\\\alpha\\<\\\\omega\\_1$. We get a nice combinatorial theory of non\\-special trees: For example, an appropriate version of Fodor's lemma holds.\n2. The result holds for non\\-special trees of size less than the pseudo\\-intersection number ${\\\\mathfrak p}$. (This is one of the *cardinal invariants* of the continuum.) Again, the proof does not use forcing.\n3. Finally, a forcing argument shows that ${\\\\mathfrak p}$ can be made as large as one wants while preserving being non\\-special, and by absoluteness we get the full theorem. The argument here shows in particular, that one does not need preservation of being non\\-special under ccc forcing, simpler particular classes of forcing notions suffice.\n\nStevo's paper is \"Partition relations for partially ordered sets\". Acta Math., 155(1\\-2\\):1\u201325, 1985\\. \n\nAs far as I know, there is no forcing\\-free proof of 3\\., that the result holds for all non\\-special trees $T$, even if $\\|T\\|\\\\ge{\\\\mathfrak p}$. It cannot be a direct argument, as Stevo found examples of non\\-special trees all of whose subtrees of small size are special. Albin Jones indicated a while ago that he had an argument, but I never saw it and his webpage and contact information vanished since. In my mind, this remains open.\n\nA few years ago, Rene Schipperus proved a \"topological\" version of Baumgartner\\-Hajnal, namely that if $L$ is an uncountable subset of ${\\\\mathbb R}$, or $\\\\omega\\_1$, then for any $\\\\alpha\\<\\\\omega\\_1$ and any coloring of the 2\\-sized subsets of $L$ with finitely many colors, we can find monochromatic sets of type $\\\\alpha\\+1$ that, moreover, are closed in the natural topology of ${\\\\mathbb R}$ or $\\\\omega\\_1$. Rene uses an argument that builds on the original approach, and in particular uses MA. I don't know how to prove his theorem without using forcing.\n\nFinally: The corresponding result in dimension 3 should be that if $P$ is a non\\-special partial order, then $P\\\\to(\\\\alpha,n)^3$, i.e., that if the 3\\-sized subsets of $P$ are colored with 2 colors, then either for the first color for each $\\\\alpha\\<\\\\omega\\_1$ there are homogeneous sets of type $\\\\alpha$, or else for the second color there are linearly ordered homogeneous sets of any finite size.

For the sake of simplicity, lets assume uniform priors on the positive part of the real axis. So that have a hierarchical model as follows: $$y\\_{i}\\| \\\\lambda\\_{i}\\\\sim Poisson(\\\\lambda\\_{i})$$\n$$\\\\lambda\\_{i}\\|\\\\alpha, \\\\beta \\\\sim Gamma(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)$$\n$$\\\\pi(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)\\\\propto1\\_{\\[0,\\+\\\\infty]}$$\n\nNow you have a two groups of parameters: {$\\\\lambda\\_{i}$}$\\_{i\\=1,N}$ and {$\\\\alpha, \\\\beta$}. You need to draw random samples of these two groups of parameters from your posterior distribution. Although the model itself is not very complicated, you might stuck with very slowly mixing chains for you parameters, especially if your $N$ is very large (say 1000\\). \nYou can choose as your proposal normal distribution (just remember to reject properly negative proposed values) for whole set of parameters, in which case you would need ($N\\+2$)\\-variate normal distribution as a proposal, or you could use N\\-variate normal distirbution for lambda's and bivariate normal distribution for $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\beta$.  \n I would suggest first of all to go with separately proposing lambda's and gamma parameters \\- i.e. to use Metropolis within Gibbs sampler. This would allow you to slightly decouple thouse chains. In this investigatory step I would use covariance matrix with no autocorrelations (i.e. diagonal matrix) for $N$\\-variate normal distribution.   \n\nIf that does not work, I would introduce for proposal distribution covariance matrix where correlations are not equal to zero \\- this should improve the mixing.\nAnd if this does not produce well\\-mixing chains, I would turn to the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. But first of all try to play with different matrices of multivariate normal proposal.\nI would also suggest to modify your model: instead of Poisson intensity $\\\\lambda\\_{i}$ to use $exp(\\\\lambda\\_{i})$ and then to use normal distribution for $\\\\lambda\\_{i}$ with unknown mean and variance parameters."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a hierarchical Bayesian model for Poisson data with Gamma priors, you're experiencing slow mixing of MCMC chains, especially with a large number of observations (N \u2248 1000).

We get an infinite series consisting of ever growing number of $\\\\Sigma$ and $g^0$ in the integral. This equation basically tells us: a particle enters the system, it can propagate freely and thus scatter back into itself (by way of $g^0$) or it can interact via $V$ once at time $t\\_1$, and then again propagate freely, or multiple times at times $t\\_1, t\\_2$ and so forth. In frequency domain we get $G(\\\\omega) \\= g^0(\\\\omega) \\+ G(\\\\omega)\\\\Sigma(\\\\omega)g^0(\\\\omega)$ which allows us to solve $G(\\\\omega) \\= \\[(g^0(\\\\omega))^{\\-1} \\- \\\\Sigma(\\\\omega)]^{\\-1}$.\n\nTo sum up to here: the self\\-energy of a particle represents that parts of the interaction that relate the particle back to itself, i.e. can \"eat up\" a particle and then \"spit out\" the same particle later. It is important because knowing it allows us to have the fully dressed single particle Green function, and usually transport involves terms related to this Green function (as physically in transport we scatter particles from one end and see how they come out at the other end of the sample).\n\nIt turns out that this is not enough, however, for some transport problems, as the interaction term itself has corrections. These are the vertex corrections mentioned. In diagrams, a vertex is an interaction term, so not a single\\-particle Green function, but a term that connects Green functions. It too is being affected by interactions and goes renormalization. In transport we (sometimes) need also the vertex corrections as well since they directly go into the expression for the transport.\n\nBoth the self\\-energy and the vertex corrections are results of interactions in the theory, and usually we calculate them numerically or perturbatively.\n\n$^\\*$ I am making here some simplifying assumption for the sake of clarity, like that the interactions are only localized in time, or that the relevant fully dressed GF is the one particle one etc."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In quantum field theory, what is the significance of the self-energy of a particle in relation to transport phenomena?\n\nA) It represents all possible ways a particle can interact with itself, but has no impact on transport calculations.\n\nB) It is the sum of all connected reducible diagrams and is crucial for calculating the bare Green function.\n\nC) It represents the sum of all connected irreducible diagrams that start and end with the particle, and is important for calculating the fully dressed Green function used in transport calculations.\n\nD) It only accounts for free particle propagation and ignores all interaction effects in transport phenomena.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The self-energy of a particle in quantum field theory is defined as the sum of all connected irreducible diagrams that start and end with that particle.

The point cloud I'm testing against is very big (\\~800\\.000\\). However, this doesn't really explain why my implementation is so slow. This is my approach:\n\nFirst, I created a spatial index for the point shape \n\n`pntshp.ExecuteSQL('CREATE SPATIAL INDEX ON %s' % table_name)`\n\nI defined an array of buffer distances to narrow down the search radius. Which of course also means that I have to create a buffer for each point (which might be expensive). \n\n`BUFFER_DISTANCES = ( 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05 ) # 100m, 500m, 1km, 2km, 5km` \n\nThen, the buffer is used as a spatial filter \n\n`node_lyr.SetSpatialFilter(buff)`\n\nIf the filter returns `None` the buffer distance will be increased. \n\n```\nfor buffer_d in BUFFER_DISTANCES:\n    buffr = get_buffer(xy_street,buffer_d)\n    ...\n\n```\n\nThen I am calculating the distance to the points returned by the spatial filter\n\n```\np=ogr.Geometry(ogr.wkbPoint)\np.AddPoint(xy[0],xy[1])\n\nfor feat in node_lyr:\n    geom = feat.GetGeometryRef()\n    d = p.Distance(geom)\n    dist.append(d)       \n\n```\n\nTo get the closest point:\n\n```\ndef get_closest_pnt(dist, node, how_close):\n    mrg = zip(dist,node)\n    mrg.sort(key=lambda t: t[0])\n    try:\n        return mrg[how_close]\n    except IndexError, ierr:\n        print '%s \\ndist/node tuple contain %s' % (ierr,mrg)\n\n```\n\nIt all works fine but is really slow. Creating a spatial index didn't show any effect, really. To calculate 100 points this implementations takes \\~6,7 seconds. The program needs to be able to calculate the closest location for more than 2000 points as fast as possible. Any ideas on how to improve my approach? \n\n**EDIT**\n\nI tried different approaches to see where it gets me. I came across something very astonishing I want to share here. \n\nI implemented a simple lookup algorithm as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19154296/python-how-to-search-for-a-substring-in-a-set-the-fast-way), and one of the solutions that where suggested (the sorted set approach). \n\nThe surprising fact is that performance is not only dependent on the implementation but even more so of the OSX. My original ogr/buffer algorithm turns out to be blazing fast on my OSX whereas it is painstaking slow on Linux (hence the question here). \n\nHere are my results (100 runs). \n\n```\nMethod       |     OSX        |  Linux Ubuntu\nogr buffer   | 0:00:01.434389 | 0:01:08.384309\n\nsub string   | 0:00:19.714432 | 0:00:10.048649\n\nsorted set   | 0:00:01.239999 | 0:00:00.600773\n\nSpecs Mac OSX\nProcessor 4x2.5 GHz  \nMemory 8 GB 1600 MHz\n\nSpecs Dell Linux Ubuntu\nProcessor 8x3.4GHz\nMemory 7.8 GB\n\n```\n\nIf someone can explain why these differences occur, please don't hesitate. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Avoiding the spatial query**\n------------------------------\n\nSince you noted buffering is computationally expensive and may be holding you back, consider this approach: Start looping through each point and round off your lat long point to a decimal place within your buffer (i.e. if your lat/long is 12\\.3456789/12\\.3456789 then get all points that begin with a lat/long of 12\\.34567/12\\.34567 or 12\\.34568/12\\.34568 or 12\\.34567/12\\.34568 or 12\\.34568/12\\.34567\\). Use a [hash table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) to do this. Take this subset of points, get all distances to your input point, and the point with minimum distance is the one you want. Creating a lookup methodology will make this very efficient.\n\nThis avoids having to do expensive spatial queries and query filter setup 800,000 times. You would only be doing string/double comparisons and distance calculations in this method. The only downside that I could see to this method is that each decimal roundoff is an order of magnitude above the last, so if your spatial query didn't return any points, rounding down again may return many more points than you need, which would slow you down a bit. However, you have at least two orders of magnitude in your orignal BUFFER\\_DISTANCES, so I think this method may suffice for your purposes and would certainly be faster than the method you have going right now.\n\n**The hash table:**\n-------------------\n\n[Here's](http://www.codeguru.com/cpp/cpp/algorithms/hash/article.php/c5131/Introduction-to-Hash-Tables.htm) a more concise and better introductory explanation to hash tables. \n\nThe concept is like so: You want to look up the definition for the word \"Yes\" in the dictionary. You don't look through every word in a dictionary starting from A to find the words that start with Ye, correct? You jump straight to the Y section first, then you look for the page that says Ye\\-Yo and then you scan all the words on that page to get the definition for Yes.\n\nThe lookup methodology to loop through all the lat/long points would be implemented in this same fashion. You'd look first for all the lat/longs that start with 12\\.3 in a range from, lets say 0 to 99\\. Then you'd look in those 10 values for 12\\.34, and so on. If programmed correctly, you can return a \"bucket\" with all of the points within your buffer, without having to execute a single spatial query or string/double comparison!\n\nFinally, it should be noted that if you store your indexed table in a RDBMS, there may be optimization for this already. If your lat/long values are doubles and do a simple [BETWEEN](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_between.asp) SQL query, it will likely have its search function [already optimized](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/557425/optimize-sql-that-uses-between-clause) to do this (if your query is written correctly)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are developing a program to find the closest location from a given point in a large dataset of 800,000 points.

Using a hash table with rounded coordinates avoids expensive spatial queries and allows for efficient lookup of nearby points.\nOption C doesn't address the core performance issue and relies on the same slow spatial query approach.\nOption D may provide some speed improvements but doesn't address the algorithmic inefficiency and would require significant rewriting of the code.\n\nThe hash table approach with rounded coordinates allows for quick retrieval of points within a certain range without performing spatial queries.

It also scales well with large datasets, making it suitable for the 800,000 point cloud mentioned in the question."}, "37": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/03/15", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/138912", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/48998/"], "docs_id": 138912, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I effortlessly installed QGIS 2\\.4 and upgraded to 2\\.6, for my Linux Mint 16, because I just had to put <http://qgis.org/debian> in my repositories list and note that my distro was `saucy`.\n\n2\\.8 has been out for some time now, and QGIS nicely updated to the new version for several different debian distros, but...not `saucy`.\n\nI cannot figure out how to e\\-mail whatever volunteers do this and ask for `saucy` to be added.

Existing user profiles have already been created and customized, so they won't automatically adopt the new layout. To resolve this, the administrator needs to delete the existing user profiles and have users log in again, which will create new profiles based on the updated default profile with the custom Start Layout.

If I was wiring that, I would not have done it that way. Now that it's already like that, fixing it is most likely a big chore. If, and that's a big, unlikely if, you're lucky, you may have more than one wire run coming into the electrical panel to that breaker. In that case, one or more of the runs could be moved to a new breaker (assuming there's room in the panel, and I find it hard to believe there isn't). Working in an electrical panel is dangerous and must be done by an individual that understands what they're doing, be it you or an electrician. Please be careful.\n\nIf you're not lucky, there will be one main run coming off of the breaker, and it's split somewhere in an electrical box in your home.

I'm using OpenStreetMaps data as my input for water bodies, and I'm using QGis on Ubuntu to process this data. Eventually I would like to be able to take any bounding box as an input, and generate a raster image (2048px by 2048px) that has blue pixels where there is surface water, and black pixels where there is land (or sea; I'm not concerned with ocean water \\- these can be blue or black). Given that most maps/visualisation tools that use OSM data (such as openstreetmaps.org, Overpass, GeoJSON.io, etc) display inland water as solid blue polygons, I'm sure this can't be too hard to achieve!\n\nAt the moment I am trying to do this manually. Ideally this would all be accomplished with free and open source data and software. I intend to create a tool to do this automatically if and when I figure this out. Here is what I have tried:\n\nFirst I grabbed some OSM data representing inland water using the Overpass API at [http://overpass\\-turbo.eu/](http://overpass-turbo.eu/) I used the following query:\n\n```\n(\n    way[\"natural\"=\"water\"]({bbox});\n    rel[\"natural\"=\"water\"]({bbox});\n    way[\"water\"=\"lake\"]({bbox});\n    rel[\"water\"=\"lake\"]({bbox});\n    way[\"waterway\"]({bbox});\n    rel[\"waterway\"]({bbox});    \n);\n(._;>;);\nout;\n\n```\n\nI then exported this data in GPX format and imported it as a vector layer into QGis. The lakes are all presented as outlines and the rivers as one\\-pixel\\-wide lines. I also imported a simple GeoJSON polygon that represented my bounding box, set it to have a black style, and clipped the other layer to it. I would now like to export the two layers as a 2048x2048 bitmap/png (or similar). I tried to use Raster Menu \\> Conversion \\> Rasterize on just the water layer, but this produced a blank raster. I then tried to use the Print Composer as suggested in an answer to [this question](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/3718/how-to-control-image-output-settings-in-qgis) but this proved to be a lot of work to get it to stretch correctly, and my polygons were not solid but just outlines so I had to fill them in manually.\n\nI must be missing a relatively simple solution here. **How can I generate a simple, 2 colour raster image representing surface water for a given bounding box?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I couldn't get your overpass query to work so I tried building it using the wizard. I confess I tend to use the **QuickOSM plugin** as I find the overpass query language a bit tricky :)\n\nThis is the query I went with:\\-\n\n```\n/*\nThis has been generated by the overpass-turbo wizard.\nThe original search was:\n\u201cnatural=water or water=lake or waterway=*\u201d\n*/\n[out:json][timeout:25];\n// gather results\n(\n  // query part for: \u201cnatural=water\u201d\n  node[\"natural\"=\"water\"]({{bbox}});\n  way[\"natural\"=\"water\"]({{bbox}});\n  relation[\"natural\"=\"water\"]({{bbox}});\n  // query part for: \u201cwater=lake\u201d\n  node[\"water\"=\"lake\"]({{bbox}});\n  way[\"water\"=\"lake\"]({{bbox}});\n  relation[\"water\"=\"lake\"]({{bbox}});\n  // query part for: \u201cwaterway=*\u201d\n  node[\"waterway\"]({{bbox}});\n  way[\"waterway\"]({{bbox}});\n  relation[\"waterway\"]({{bbox}});\n);\n// print results\nout body;\n>;\nout skel qt;\n\n```\n\nBrought the GPX into QGIS. \n\nHowever, attempting to rasterize gives the error message \"not a known GDAL format\". So I downloaded a GeoJSON instead \\- same problem. So I saved the GeoJSON to a shapefile instead, and used that.\n\nHowever, I had to manually edit the GDAL command line (using the pencil icon next to the command) and include a \"burn\" value (here, I chose 10\\)\n\n```\ngdal_rasterize -burn 10 -ts 3000 3000 /path/to/my.shp /path/to/generated.tif\n\n```\n\nThis should create a raster with 0 for the background, and 10 where there is water.\n\nI got the same result; a black raster. The reason for this is that the default is to **not** stretch the histogram to the full range of values; instead it clips the bottom and top 2% of values. If fewer than 2% of pixel values are 10, it'll assume the range is 0\\..0, hence the black image.\n\nIf you go into **Layer Properties \\> Rendering \\> Band Rendering**, choose SingleBand Grey, Min/Max, Full Extent, Actual Accuracy and click `Load` it should show the full range of values (0 to 10\\).\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/t28PD.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/t28PD.png)\n\nApply that, and you should now see your waterways. \n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/BbEkJ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/BbEkJ.png)\n\nIn this case I just did one layer, the lines. You might want to use **Merge Shapefiles** to combine your various layers, and rasterize the combined shapefile. \n\nIf that doesn't work (e.g. mixing lines/polygons) you can either\n\n* use **Raster Calculator** to mix your resulting rasters together\n* use **Buffer** on your lines to make them polygons, then merge / rasterize\n\nIt looks a bit \"gritty\", with gaps. These will vanish if you zoom in. (I might have turned off anti\\-aliasing)\n\n**EDIT**\n\nTo clarify how to fill in the lakes...\n\nImport the GeoJSON file you exported from Overpass, and bring in the Polygon layer:\\-\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/BhKk3.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/BhKk3.png)\n\nIf neccessary, save to shapefile.

The signal is amplitude moderated \\- the difference between the signal wire(s) and reference wire voltages being above, below or between certain voltages\n\nWell .. sort of. This model breaks down for fast signals over long wires where *transmission line* behavior takes over. It also doesn't cover the popular 4\\-20ma *current loop* signalling system, and things like Ethernet which is isolated by tiny transformers and the ends can float as much as 1500V apart without being out of spec.\n\nThere is also radio transmission, which uses electromagnetic field coupling to transfer a signal using zero wires!\n\n> But potential takes time to build, and time to dissipate.

Current doesn't actually flow in the wire.\n\nAny form of sharp transient signal that drives a single wire will travel along the wire, behaving like a transmission line with the self\\-inductance of the wire and its capacitance to ground (even though that may be far away). The signal will tend to bleed off the wire, and may be reflected from the far end.

The PowerPAD\n> derives its name and low thermal impedance from the large bonding pad on the bottom of the device. The circuit board must have an area of solder\\-tinned\\-copper underneath the package. The dimensions of this area depend on the size of the PowerPAD package. Thermal vias connect this area to internal or external copper planes and should have a drill diameter sufficiently small so that the via hole is effectively plugged when the barrel of the via is plated with copper. This plug is needed to prevent wicking the solder away from the interface between the package body and the solder\\-tinned area under the device during solder reflow. Drill diameters of 0\\.33 mm (13 mils) work well when 1\\-oz. copper is plated at the surface of the board while simultaneously plating the barrel of the via. If the thermal vias are not plugged when the copper plating is performed, then a solder mask material should be used to cap the vias with a diameter equal to the via diameter of 0\\.1 mm minimum. This capping prevents the solder from being wicked through the thermal vias and potentially creating a solder void under the package. (See the Related Documentation section.)\n\nAlso, in the pin function table for the thermal pad it says\n\n> This pad must be tied externally to a ground plane and the GND pin.\n\nMy questions 1\\) does this mean I need to have a solder connection between the chip and the pad?

This question tests understanding of the nuanced differences between \"all\" and \"some\" in logical and linguistic contexts.\n\nOption A is incorrect because \"some\" does not always imply \"all\". In fact, \"some\" typically suggests a portion less than the whole.\n\nOption B is a reversal of the actual relationship. \"Some\" would be a subset of \"all\", not the other way around.\n\nOption C is false because \"some\" and \"all\" have distinct meanings and cannot be used interchangeably in formal logic without changing the meaning of statements.\n\nOption D correctly captures the essence of the difference.

From within your editor\n---------------------------\n\nMany TeX IDEs provide access to `texdoc` through a menu item. This will depend on the actual editor, but looking in the Help menu is usually a place to start.\n\n3\\. texdoc.org\n--------------\n\nThere is an online version of `texdoc` that allows you to get the PDF documentation through the web directly: The URL will have the form:\n\n```\nhttp://texdoc.org/pkg/<packagename>\n\n```\n\nSo for your example:\n\n```\nhttp://texdoc.net/pkg/pgf\n\n```\n\n4\\. CTAN\n--------\n\nAll of the packages in TeXLive and MikTeX are hosted on [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/), the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network.\n\nAs a last resort you can search there for the package and its documentation will be there too.\n\nDocumentation of the core LaTeX commands\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf you want to find documentation of commands that are part of the LaTeX kernel, you can find them documented in the following documents. The first documents the basic LaTeX commands, and the second documents the new LaTeX3 commands that have been added in recent years.\n\n```\n texdoc latex2e \n\n texdoc interface3\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're working on a LaTeX project and need to find the documentation for the TikZ package.

Simply recreating the repository or editing configuration files won't address the root cause. The correct solution is to run the createrepo command again with the proper baseURL specified after the -u flag, followed by the --update option.
