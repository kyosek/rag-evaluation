R. Martin, I came across the following line which seemed odd to me. *(Note, English is only my third language so \"seemed odd to me\" is about as meaningless as it gets)*\n\n> \\[...], even if he did look like a monstrous yellow slug and smell of piss.\n\nThe *smell* part is what seems off to me, though I realize there's an assumed repetition of *he did*. I guess I just find it sounding odd.\n\nIs the used phrasing correct? Is it also correct to use the following line?\n\n> \\[...], even if he did look like a monstrous yellow slug and **smelled** of piss.\n\nWhich way is most common in English?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Both are possible. In the original, as you say, *he did* is understood. You could also write:\n\n> ... if he did look like a monstrous yellow slug and did smell of piss.\n\nIn your example, only the subject *he* is understood and so you would still need to mark the verb as past. Personally, I don't like the combining of the two different forms of the past tense with *and*.\n\nFor example, I don't like:\n\n> He *did go* home and *ate*.\n\nThis is essentially what your second sentence is.\n\nA better comparison would be:\n\n> He is walking and talking on his phone.\n> \n> \n> He is walking and is talking on his phone.\n\nTo me, both are equally correct, but the first is much more common in English. The repetition of the auxiliary verb *is* (or any other auxiliary for that matter) is more common when there is a large separation between the two verbs. There is no simple rule as to which is the most common."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following sentences best maintains consistent verb tense and structure while conveying the same meaning as the original quote from \"A Dance with Dragons\"?\n\nA) Even if he looked like a monstrous yellow slug and smelled of piss.\nB) Even if he did look like a monstrous yellow slug and did smell of piss.\nC) Even if he looked like a monstrous yellow slug and did smell of piss.\nD) Even if he did look like a monstrous yellow slug and smell of piss.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the best choice because it maintains consistent verb tense and structure throughout the sentence. It uses the emphatic \"did\" before both verbs, creating a parallel structure that matches the original quote's implied repetition of \"he did.\"\n\nOption A changes the structure entirely, losing the emphatic \"did\" and altering the original meaning slightly.\n\nOption C mixes tenses inconsistently, using \"looked\" in the first part and \"did smell\" in the second, which is stylistically awkward.\n\nOption D is the closest to the original quote but still presents a grammatical inconsistency by using \"did look\" and then just \"smell\" without the \"did.\"\n\nWhile the original quote omits the second \"did\" for brevity, option B provides the most grammatically consistent and parallel structure when fully written out."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/04/15", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/1134115", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/945079/"], "docs_id": 1134115, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a number of Ubuntu guests running on an Ubuntu 16\\.04\\.6 kvm host.\n\nSince I had to reboot my host, networking no longer works correctly.

Change the Network source from \"Bridge br0: Host device eno1\" to \"NAT\" in the guest VM's configuration.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The root cause of this issue is that Docker changes the default policy for the iptables FORWARD chain to DROP, which prevents traffic from flowing between the bridge interface and the internet. Adding the rule \"sudo iptables -I FORWARD -i br0 -o br0 -j ACCEPT\" allows traffic to pass through the bridge interface, restoring connectivity for the guest VMs. This solution directly addresses the problem introduced by Docker's modification of the iptables rules, which is not apparent from the initial network configuration."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/07/12", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/273943", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/154553/"], "docs_id": 273943, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have found \\~3 Pok\u00e9mon out in the wild I have wanted to catch but when I try to tap them on the map but it doesn't do anything.

I first thought about using the convex hull of the set:\n\n```py\nconvex_hull = Sectioned_geostore_obstacles_geometry.unary_union.convex_hull\nconvex_hull = geopandas.GeoDataFrame({'geometry': convex_hull, 'convex_hull':[1]})\n\nax = Sectioned_geostore_obstacles_geometry['Gondola'].plot(color='red')\nconvex_hull.plot(ax=ax, color='green', alpha=0.5)\n\n```\n\nwhich results in\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YCM0z.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YCM0z.png)\n\nbut this isn't quite right since what I am looking for isn't convex. The second idea is to use the envelope:\n\n```py\nenvelope = Sectioned_geostore_obstacles_geometry.unary_union.envelope\nenvelope = geopandas.GeoDataFrame({'geometry': envelope, 'convex_hull':[1]})\n\nax = Sectioned_geostore_obstacles_geometry['Gondola'].plot(color='red')\nenvelope.plot(ax=ax, color='green', alpha=0.5)\n\n```\n\nwhich is\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5e97T.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5e97T.png)\n\nAgain, this isn't it. Yet another attempt is to use the cascade\\_union functionality from shapely:\n\n```py\nfrom shapely.ops import cascaded_union\n\npolygons = list(Sectioned_geostore_obstacles_geometry.Gondola)\nboundary = gpd.GeoSeries(cascaded_union(polygons))\n\n```\n\nwhich is:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GBZgG.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GBZgG.png)\n\nBut, this isn't it either as it returns a MultiPolygon instead of the minimal developing polygon. Basically, I need the envelope to shrink to follow the contour of the set of objects.\n\nTo test this, I add the following example data:\n\n```py\ntest_df =  geopandas.GeoSeries([Polygon([(0,0), (2,0), (2,2), (0,2)]),\n                              Polygon([(2,2), (4,2), (4,4), (2,4)])])\ntest_df = geopandas.GeoDataFrame({'geometry': test_df, 'df1':[1,2]})\n\nconvex_hull = test_df.unary_union.convex_hull\nconvex_hull = geopandas.GeoDataFrame({'geometry': convex_hull, 'convex_hull':[1]})\n\nax1 = test_df['geometry'].plot(color='red')\nconvex_hull.plot(ax=ax1, color='green', alpha=0.5)\n\nenvelope = test_df.unary_union.envelope\nenvelope = geopandas.GeoDataFrame({'geometry': envelope, 'convex_hull':[1]})\n\nax2 = test_df['geometry'].plot(color='red')\nenvelope.plot(ax=ax2, color='green', alpha=0.5)\n\n```\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZPGRV.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZPGRV.png)\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/erGa3.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/erGa3.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What you need is a [concave hull](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CpaTi.png).

The scaling is terrible and grossly non\\-linear.\n\nFor a series tuned circuit, the frequency that causes the voltage across the capacitor to become maximum is the same frequency that causes the inductor voltage to be maximum. Technically there is a very small difference but, the picture totally misguides the reader in the extent to which this difference appears to be.\n\nThis is just plain wrong: \\-\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/X3CVH.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/X3CVH.png)\n\nYou'll never find any value of R, L and C that produces a graph that looks anything like this.\n\nHere's a series tuned circuit at resonance: \\-\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iM7H8.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iM7H8.png)\n\nAll three voltages peak at the same frequency. So, once you forget the incorrect diagram on the website you linked, the answer to your question is simple.\n\n> *Why at some particular frequency (fc), the capacitor voltage goes\n> beyond supply voltage (Vs) value?*\n\nAt series resonance, inductive reactance and capacitive reactance values cancel out leaving just the resistance across the source. This means maximum current at this frequency and, the value of the current is Vs/R. You can then use that value of current to determine what the voltages are across either L or C. And what you find is that with small values of R, there is voltage magnification at resonance.

This phenomenon is known as voltage magnification and is more pronounced when the resistance in the circuit is small. Both VL and VC reach their peak values at the same frequency (the resonant frequency), contrary to what the incorrect graph in the original question suggested. The degree of voltage magnification depends on the quality factor (Q) of the circuit, which is inversely proportional to the resistance.

In the Ising model, if the **energy difference between the two states in the two\\-spin system is $a$** than it is the convention to choose the energy value of the **high energy state** (i.e. the state in which the two spins **are not** in the same direction) to be $a/2$ and then it follows that the energy value of the **low energy state** (i.e. the state in which the two spins **are** in the same direction) is $\\-a/2$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a 2D Ising model on a square lattice with N sites.

I am using SI units)\n\nStarting with Gauss' law,\n\n$$\\\\nabla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{E}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right) \\= \\\\frac{\\\\rho\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right)}{\\\\varepsilon\\_0}$$\n\nI transformed it to its integral form in 2D and 3D using the [divergence theorem *in \"$n$\" dimensions*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem#Multiple_dimensions),\n$$\\\\int\\_U \\\\text{d}^{n}{r} \\\\, \\\\nabla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A} \\= \\\\oint\\_{\\\\partial U} \n\\\\text{d}^{n\\-1}r \\\\, \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}}.$$\n\nwhich gives\n\n$$ \\\\oint\\_{\\\\partial S} \\\\text{d}r \\\\, \\\\mathbf{E}\\\\left(x,y\\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} \\= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon\\_0} \\\\int\\_S \\\\text{d}^2 r \\\\, \\\\rho\\\\left(x,y\\\\right), \\\\quad \\\\text{(2D)}$$\n$$\\\\oint\\_{\\\\partial V} \\\\text{d}^2 r \\\\, \\\\mathbf{E}\\\\left(x,y,z\\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} \\= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon\\_0} \\\\int\\_V \\\\text{d}^3 r \\\\, \\\\rho\\\\left(x,y,z\\\\right). \\\\quad \\\\text{(3D)}$$\n\nHere I explicitly show that $\\\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\\\rho$ are in 2D and 3D. *PS. in 2D, $S$ is the surface you integrate over and $\\\\partial S$ is its boundary 'line'; in 3D, $V$ is the volume you integrate over and $\\\\partial V$ is its boundary surface*\n\nNow suppose we have a point charge $Q$ at the origin, i.e. $$\\\\rho\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right) \\= Q \\\\, \\\\delta^{(3\\)}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right)$$ (where $\\\\delta^{(3\\)}$ is the Dirac delta function in 3 dimensions, i.e. with units $\\\\text{m}^{\\-3}$). **I am using this in 2D and in 3D, since $\\\\rho\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right)$ must have dimensions of $\\\\text{C} \\\\, \\\\text{m}^{\\-3}$ by virtue of Gauss' law, regardless the dimensionality.**\n\nIn 3D, we use as the integration volume a sphere with radius $r$ centred at the origin (just like any elementary electromagnetism textbook does it).\n\nIn 2D, we use as the integration surface a circle with radius $r$ centred at the origin $(x,y)\\=(0,0\\)$ (remember, the 2D 'world' is the $xy$\\-plane, i.e. $z\\=0$ plane).\n\nBy symmetry considerations, it's clear that in 2D and in 3D the field only has a radial component. I will mark this as $E\\_r$ in both cases, although I want to emphasise that \"$r$\" in 2D means $\\\\sqrt{x^2\\+y^2}$ while in 3D it means $\\\\sqrt{x^2\\+y^2\\+z^2}$. This gives\n\n$$ 2\\\\pi r E\\_r \\= \\\\frac{Q}{\\\\varepsilon\\_0} \\\\int\\_S \\\\text{d}^2 r \\\\, \\\\delta^{(3\\)}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right) \\= \\\\frac{Q}{\\\\varepsilon\\_0} \\\\delta\\\\left(z\\\\right), \\\\quad \\\\text{(2D)}$$\n$$ 4 \\\\pi r^2 E\\_r \\= \\\\frac{Q}{\\\\varepsilon\\_0} \\\\int\\_V \\\\text{d}^3 r \\\\, \\\\delta^{(3\\)}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right) \\= \\\\frac{Q}{\\\\varepsilon\\_0}, \\\\quad \\\\text{(3D)}$$\n\nwhere I made use of $\\\\delta^{(3\\)}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right) \\= \\\\delta(x)\\\\delta(y)\\\\delta(z)$. Rewriting gives my final result for the electric field:\n\n$$ \\\\mathbf{E}\\\\left(x,y\\\\right) \\= \\\\frac{Q}{2\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon\\_0} \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\delta\\\\left(z\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{r}}, \\\\quad \\\\text{(2D)}$$\n$$ \\\\mathbf{E}\\\\left(x,y,z\\\\right) \\= \\\\frac{Q}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon\\_0} \\\\frac{1}{r^2} \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{r}}, \\\\quad \\\\text{(3D)}$$\n\nDisturbingly, I'm left with a Dirac delta function in my electric field, although I do get the $E\\_\\\\text{2D} \\\\sim 1/r$ dependence I expected. I guess it makes some sense that the $\\\\delta$\\-function is there, since I'm only concerned with $z\\=0$ anyways, but it of course shouldn't be the case that a physical quantity like the electric field is merely a mathematical 'distribution' i.e. delta function. However, I cannot just leave out the $\\\\delta$\\-function, since it carries a unit of $1/\\\\text{meter}$ which is crucial to make the units consistent.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong here? As you can see, I tried to do this derivation *rigorously* by starting from Gauss' law in coordinate\\-free form, and then converting using the divergence theorem; in this step, the difference between 2D and 3D should arise. I have seen other questions on this website where people would instead simply say that the right\\-hand side becomes the \"enclosed charge\" $$Q\\_\\\\text{encl} \\= \\\\int\\_V \\\\text{d}^3 r \\\\,\\\\rho\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right)$$ even in 2D (e.g. [this answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/264627/353438)), but they end up (as far as I can see) with inconsistent units (i.e. they miss a $1/\\\\text{meter}$ which I have in my $\\\\delta\\\\left(z\\\\right)$). Another common method of getting rid of this I see is that people use a 'line charge density' $\\\\lambda$ (units $\\\\text{C} \\\\, \\\\text{m}^{\\-1}$) (e.g. [this answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/376641)), but that is only if you have an infinitely long line with a charge per unit length $\\\\lambda$. This shouldn't be valid for a point charge I think.\n\nI hope anyone can help me here.

Recently, while investigating best practices and tools for Python development I found [`pyenv-virtualenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv). I find it useful (it takes care of using the right method for creating the virtual environment depending on the Python version) and clean (since the `venv` directory is not entangled with your codebase).\n\nThe problem I find is that previously (when using `pyenv` and `virtualenv` separately) I would push my `requirements.txt` file and my `.python-version` file to the repository. When cloning the project a few months later I could recreate my virtual environment using `requirements.txt` and could check `.python-version` to see which Python version I was developing on.\n\nWith `pyenv-virtualenv`, however, the `.python-version` file is less useful. Since in `pyenv-virtualenv` a virtual environment is treated like a new version of Python inside `pyenv`, and the way to link your project to the virtual environment is by \"setting the Python version\" to that virtual environment, the file no longer contains the exact Python version you are using.\n\nLet's pretend I'm working on project Euler and decide to create a virtual environment for it using `pyenv-virtualenv`, and I call it project\\_euler. In order to make my code base to run on that virtual environment I need to go to the project's directory and type: `pyenv local project_euler`.\n\nNow everything works great locally, but when I push to my repository and grab it again in a few months, `.python-version` won't be too useful, since it will only say \"project\\_euler\". Furthermore, if the person who downloads the repository has a virtualenv named `project_euler` as well which is configured differently to the one I was using when I pushed, **they might use a wrongly\\-configured environment without realising it**. This wasn't a problem when using `pyenv` and `virtualenv` separately, since `.python-version` only included information about the Python version then, not the name of the virtual environment in use.\n\nWhat are the best practices to deal with these issues? I can think of several options:\n\n* Include the Python version in the name of your virtual environments: `project_euler_3.5.3` (note that this does not solve the issue with using the wrong virtual environment by mistake).\n* Do not push `.python-version`, instead document the minimum supported Python version in the `README`.\n* Do not push `.python-version`, and do not document the Python version (doesn't seem right, since there are retrocompatibility issues even between minor revisions \\-\\-e.g. 3\\.5 vs 3\\.4\\-\\- so it shouldn't be up to the user to have to guess).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would recommend using [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for python development which solves a bunch of problems. \n\nIt is now the [official](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/managing-dependencies/#managing-dependencies) tool recommended from python.org\n\nIf you have experience with say npm or something like that, pipenv behaves in similar ways.

Given the following information, what is the most likely solution to resolve this issue?\n\nAndroid device:\n- OS: 5.0.2 (Lollipop)\n- Bluetooth version: 4.0\n\nMac:\n- MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\n- OS: El Capitan\n- Bluetooth version: 4.1 (LMP version 0x7)\n\nA) Update the Android device to the latest OS version\nB) Downgrade the Mac's Bluetooth version to 4.0\nC) Reset the Homebrew repository on the Mac\nD) Enable developer options on the Android device\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While the initial problem seems to be related to Bluetooth connectivity between an Android device and a Mac, the solution provided in the documentation is unexpectedly related to Homebrew, a package management system for macOS. The correct answer is to reset the Homebrew repository on the Mac using the command:\n\n`cd $(brew --repo) && git fetch && git reset --hard origin/master && brew update`\n\nThis solution suggests that the issue might be caused by a software conflict or outdated packages on the Mac, rather than a direct Bluetooth compatibility problem. Resetting the Homebrew repository can resolve various system-level issues that might interfere with Bluetooth functionality or device discovery.\n\nThe other options are less likely to solve the problem:\nA) Updating the Android OS might help, but it's not the solution provided in the documentation.\nB) Downgrading the Mac's Bluetooth version is not possible and wouldn't necessarily solve the issue.\nD) Enabling developer options on Android is unlikely to affect Bluetooth discovery."}, "20": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/01/11", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/257537", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/76150/"], "docs_id": 257537, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've tried multiple ways and sources of trying to save data in Magento 2\\.3 and I cannot think of what more I can try to get this working.

If that's the case and cost differences are ignored, what would be the reason for any one to use RDS MySQL? What are the technical differences between the two which would make someone not choose Aurora?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The technical differences are summarised nicely in this SlideShare \\- [http://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/amazon\\-aurora\\-amazons\\-new\\-relational\\-database\\-engine](http://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/amazon-aurora-amazons-new-relational-database-engine)\n\nIt's really quite a different architecture/implementation under the covers from standard MySQL, and one that is fundamentally closed. \n\nAmazon are being coy about the extent to which the front end is a MySQL derivative or a complete rewrite that is protocol\\-compatible \\- see [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/11/26/inside\\_aurora\\_how\\_disruptive\\_is\\_amazons\\_mysql\\_clone/?page\\=2](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/11/26/inside_aurora_how_disruptive_is_amazons_mysql_clone/?page=2) \\- but it looks likely it's at least a major fork with lots of new code. It will have different bugs from the main MySQL releases, which users will be reliant on Amazon to fix. A distributed transactional database backend is a complex thing to write, and while Amazon have some of the best engineers in the world for this sort of system, it's still quite new.\n\nIt relies on a completely new Amazon\\-specific multi\\-tenanted storage backend, and the updated software isn't freely available as open source, so you can't just download it and run it on your own servers. It may diverge over time (e.g. years) in terms of functional features supported, meaning that code developed against Aurora may no longer work against mainstream MySQL releases, providing a risk of increased lock\\-in to Amazon.\n\nRegardless, especially if your application needs them, the performance, low replica lag, scalability and recovery time reductions over standard MySQL look pretty compelling in the short term. The lock\\-in and costs are certainly much lower than with, for example, Oracle's Exadata \\- which is really the class of solution that Amazon are targetting."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes a key technical difference between Amazon Aurora and standard RDS MySQL that might cause an organization to hesitate in adopting Aurora?\n\nA) Aurora has significantly lower performance compared to standard MySQL.\nB) Aurora uses an open-source storage backend that can be easily replicated on-premises.\nC) Aurora is a proprietary fork of MySQL with a closed-source backend, potentially leading to vendor lock-in.\nD) Aurora has identical bug patterns to standard MySQL, making troubleshooting familiar for experienced MySQL administrators.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, Aurora uses a proprietary, Amazon-specific multi-tenanted storage backend that isn't freely available as open source. This means users can't run it on their own servers and may become increasingly dependent on Amazon's ecosystem over time. This potential for vendor lock-in is a significant consideration for organizations when choosing between Aurora and standard RDS MySQL.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Aurora is actually designed to be more performant than standard MySQL.\nOption B is incorrect because Aurora's backend is closed-source and Amazon-specific, not open-source or easily replicable.\nOption D is incorrect because Aurora, being a major fork or rewrite of MySQL, will have different bugs from standard MySQL releases, which users will rely on Amazon to fix."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/12/16", "source": ["https://tex.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/780", "https://tex.meta.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.meta.stackexchange.com/users/117/"], "docs_id": 780, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I like the design of \"[photography etc.](https://photo.stackexchange.com/)\" and I love the idea of a weekly image.

I expect that most of the time we'll get TikZ...but that's fine. We should perhaps have some rules regarding size or aspect ratio that should be upheld. Every week, the winning entry from the previous week takes the stage with a brief explanation, a longer one could also be accessed (along with the source code ofcourse!)\n\nThe point is that most of the entries we have, have to do with stuff that doesn't work, and we hardly get to see stuff when it works and is nicely polished. It would be really nice (I think) to have a post saying something like \"I needed this, but didn't know how to do FOO so I posted THIS question got a reply by BAZ and here's the result!\" (of course, images do not have to be the result of a posting here....)\n\nThat would only be the explanation of the typeset image, but the image itself would/could/might appear alongside the top of the page, or something like that.\n\nWhat do you people think?\n\nTo start with, and see if we even have sufficient entries for such an ongoing competition, we could leave the design alone and simple have a page dedicated for such distractions....\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: That's interesting. However, on our site it might be much harder than on a photography site, where each user may have hundreds or thousands of photographies readily available.\n\nBut a TeX showcase with several competitive contributions each week seems hardly possible to me, at least long\\-term. A monthly TeX sample sounds more realizable. Instead of comparing very different contributions, like a TikZ example vs. a nice table vs. dynamic pdf content, there could be one topic for each month.\n\nHow may it work?\n\n* There could be a monthly posting on meta: What shall be this month's topic? Users could post suggestions which are voted on, as usual.\n* The suggestion with the most votes will make it to the main site: a call for contributions to this month's topic.\n* The contribution with the most votes will get a prominent place on the site.\n\nWho has got very nice examples, may always suggest it for a month, perhaps promoting it by some information. Of course suggestions may be repeated, especially if they just did not make it in a previous month.\n\nTeX.SE is still a Q\\&A site. However, the competition consists of questions asking for good solutions on certain topics.\n\nThe results may contribute to the promotion of our site, and a high\\-quality TeX showcase could grow month by month."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the top answer, what is suggested as a more feasible alternative to the original weekly TeX showcase proposal?\n\nA) A daily TeX showcase with competitive contributions\nB) A monthly TeX showcase with a specific topic each month\nC) A weekly TeX showcase focused only on TikZ examples\nD) A bi-annual TeX showcase with no specific topic restrictions\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The top answer suggests that a weekly TeX showcase might be too frequent and difficult to maintain.

For such radiation, the temperature of a body defines its radiation spectrum and its peak.\n\nThe EM radiation in fluorescent tube is not due to heat, but due to fluorescence, which is a type luminescence, defined as emission of light *not caused by heat*, but by other processes.\n\nMore specifically, in a fluorescent tube, UV photons are emitted by mercury vapor atoms, excited by fast moving charge carriers (sort of electroluminescence), and then visible light photons are emitted by phosphor coating atoms, excited by UV photons (fluorescence). Both steps here are forms of luminescence, not thermal radiation.\n\nSince fluorescent light is not due to thermal radiation, its temperature is not governed by black body radiation curves. Therefore, even though most of the EM radiation emitted by a fluorescent tube is in the visible light spectrum, its temperature is very low."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about fluorescent tubes is correct?\n\nA) Fluorescent tubes emit light through thermal radiation, similar to black bodies.\nB) The temperature of a fluorescent tube determines its emission spectrum peak.\nC) Fluorescent tubes produce light through a combination of electroluminescence and fluorescence, not thermal radiation.\nD) The visible light emitted by fluorescent tubes indicates they operate at very high temperatures.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nFluorescent tubes do not emit light through thermal radiation like black bodies. Instead, they produce light through a two-step process involving electroluminescence and fluorescence, both of which are forms of luminescence not caused by heat. In fluorescent tubes, mercury vapor atoms are excited by fast-moving charge carriers, emitting UV photons (electroluminescence). These UV photons then excite phosphor coating atoms, which emit visible light (fluorescence). This process occurs at relatively low temperatures, unlike thermal radiation in black bodies where temperature determines the emission spectrum. Therefore, the visible light output of fluorescent tubes is not indicative of high operating temperatures."}, "24": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/12/10", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/152378", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/94105/"], "docs_id": 152378, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Basically i have the electrical service routed down to my main meter, then a 200A breaker box off of that. This is permanently mounted to a service\\-pole outdoors.\n\nI need to add power from that pole to a small cabin 530' away. There will be a 100A panel at the cabin.\n\nI am worried about voltage drop, but will only need about 50A of service to the cabin. \n\nI will be able to bury the wire 3' without problem I suspect, but I am not sure what gauge wire to use. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is why Tesla won the War of the Currents\n=============================================\n\nThe great advantage of moving power around as AC is that one can step up the voltage easily using a *transformer* to move it a long distance with minimal losses, then step it back down to something more suitable for household utilization when it arrives at its destination. While this is normally the province of electric utilities and heavy industrial facilities, nothing in the National Electrical Code *prohibits* the application of dry\\-type distribution transformers in a more...residential setting, so given the length of your run, the use of a transformer at each end to step the voltage up for the run and back down at the cabin is an option here.\n\nI will cover the conventional (no transformers) way of doing it, first, with example pricing, and then show what it takes to use the genius of AC power distribution to *your* advantage here, again with example pricing. If you are not comfortable with any of the installation instructions here, of course, *please* speak with an electrician \\-\\- most electricians who have worked in the commercial/industrial space should be comfortable with installing a setup of this nature.\n\nDoing it the hard way, first\n----------------------------\n\nWithout the aid of transformers, we wind up running 240V @ 50 or 60A over the 530' distance. This requires *fat* wire in order to keep voltage drop from becoming excessive, (3% is the typical limit for feeders) \\-\\- a typical choice would be 3/0 aluminum XHHW\\-2 for 50A (you could use 250kcmil instead for 60A, but the bump of two wire sizes should tell you why this isn't promising already), and you'd need 3 of those \\+ a 4AWG (10AWG is the minimum for 60A, but the upsize for voltage drop forces us to upsize the grounds by the same ratio as per 250\\.122(B)) bare copper ground for this, as well as 540' (the extra is so we can do the stub\\-ups at the end) of 2\" (the wires in question take up about 465 mm2 of fill, so it's slightly too fat a run for a 1\\.5\" conduit) Schedule 80 PVC conduit and fittings. (We are doing the run in conduit in both cases as it'd be nonsensical to trench direct bury cable this far only to have to dig it all up again if requirements changed in the future.)\n\nAs to cost? The PVC costs $3 a foot or thereabouts, so we are out $1690 for the conduit here ($1620 for the conduit, and $70 for the fittings). Adding the phase and neutral wires puts us at another $.85/ft, or $1377 for 540' per conductor (so we have some left over to terminate with), and last but not least, the ground wire adds $.73/ft, or another $395\\. This adds up to nearly $3500, quite the sum for providing electric service to a humble cabin, no?\n\nIt's *transformer* time!\n------------------------\n\nHowever, with a pair of transformers of appropriate rating, we can step the voltage up to 480V for the run, allowing us to use 6AWG copper or 4AWG aluminum for the phase and neutral conductors instead. Furthermore, we can get rid of a wire by running the 480V as single\\-phase instead of split\\-phase, leaving us with a single hot, a neutral, and a ground, at the cost of needing a beefier overcurrent device in one spot, which isn't that big a deal in the grand scheme of things, as it turns out.\n\nThe transformers we need are what are called *dry\\-type distribution transformers*. Unlike the oil\\-filled transformers on utility poles (which can burst into flame under abuse), these transformers have their windings air\\-cooled and use flame retardant insulation materials, rendering them fire\\-safe for use in or on buildings of all types. Specifically, we need a pair of NEMA 3R (outdoor rated), 15kVA (15,000 Volt\\-Ampere, or equivalently 15kW of resistive load) dry\\-type transformers with 240/480V primaries and 120/240V secondaries, the slash indicating that that side of the transformer can be wired for either voltage. These cost about $650 apiece if you can get a good price on them, particularly if you can find used ones in your area, and you will need two, putting your cost for the transformers at about $1300 for the pair.\n\nWith this, we can use 4AWG aluminum XHHW\\-2 for the hot, neutral, and ground wires, giving us a wire cost of $422\\. These wires only take up 150mm2 of fill, as well, so we can downsize the conduit to 1\\.5\" and still have ample fill left over. This translates into a conduit cost of $1/ft, or $600 once the fittings ($20 for the pair) and expansion fittings ($40 for the pair) are included atop $540 or so of conduit.\n\nLast but not least, we'll need a way to protect the conductors between the two transformers, and the primary side of the cabin\\-transformer, from overcurrent. The most cost\\-effective way to do this is with *fuses* due to the fact modern fuses give you better voltage ratings for your money than circuit breakers do. A fuse block will also be needed here: the appropriate fuse, namely a 30A, 600V, Class J fuse, costs roughly $10 apiece, and a matching fuse block for Class J fuses adds another $20\\.\n\nThis sums up to a cost of about $2400 including some miscellaneous parts (such as a 1\" RMC or EMT run from the cabin's transformer to the cabin's loadcenter), or about a thousand dollars less than not using the transformers. Even if you can only get a bad ($1000 a piece) price on 15kVA single phase transformers, this is still cost\\-competitive with the straightforward approach.\n\nImplementing the transformer approach\n-------------------------------------\n\nImplementing things The Hard Way\u2122 is a well\\-trodden path, so I will not cover it further here. The transformer\\-based approach, though, requires a few different elements, so we will go over the implementation caveats first, and then cover the procedure involved in doing this.\n\n### Notes, cautions, and caveats\n\nFirst off, the transformers will need homes \\-\\- at 220lbs a piece, these are *the* heaviest pieces of electrical equipment you will ever meet, atop being quite bulky (nearly 30\" tall, almost 24\" wide, and another 15\" deep)! If you want to hang the transformer at the pole from the pole, this is possible, but will require quite a *hefty* crossmember for the transformer's mounting brackets to bolt to and a metal shield attached to the bottom to prevent sparks from starting a fire should the transformer fail; otherwise, a concrete slab with appropriately placed studs can be used to *padmount* the transformer onto the ground. Likewise, the transformer at the cabin can be bolted to a sturdy crossmember integrated into the frame of the cabin (with a spark shield if outdoors), or set on a studded concrete slab.\n\nFurthermore, you must be able to mount the cabin's loadcenter in a place with sufficient clear working space \\-\\- this may require some slightly tricky conduit routing to do so. Otherwise, trenching the conduit in and pulling the wires from the pole\\-transformer to the cabin\\-transformer is as you would do for any other underground installation, and so is the short conduit run and pull of 4AWG Al from the cabin\\-transformer to the cabin's loadcenter.\n\nNote also that you will *need* to torque all connections (both mechanical screw lugs and bolted joints) to manufacturer specified torques using a torque screwdriver or torque wrench calibrated in inch\\-pounds. You will also need to identify wires correctly \\-\\- 240V wires can use conventional black/red/white phase taping in this scheme if they are not already correctly color coded, but the 480V wires should be identified using *yellow* for hot and *grey* for neutral, with green being suitable for ground as always \\-\\- this helps prevent embarrassing disasters involving 480V power being fed to 120 or 240V appliances. In fact, you should apply the phase tape to the wires *before* you put the wires together and pull them through \\-\\- this makes sure the wires are properly identified at both ends, which will avoid mixups down the road.\n\nLast but not least, all of this, especially the 480V work, *must* be done with the power off, and preferably locked out at the pole using a lockoff and cheap padlock fitted to the newly installed breaker in the pole's loadcenter. This is because 480V not only will shock the living daylights out of you, it can *blow you to high heaven* in what is called an *arc flash* event. \n\n### Finally, the how\\-to\n\nAs to wiring this all \\-\\- the wires from the 50A or 60A breaker that will feed this all (using whatever Chapter 3 wiring means you wish \\-\\- you only need 2 hots and a ground here, so you can use 4AWG Al XHHW\\-2 in 3/4\" or 1\" metal conduit, or a short length of 6/2 UF with cable clamps at each end for that matter) in the pole's loadcenter go to the X1 and X4 terminals on the pole\\-transformer, while the X2 and X3 terminals should be jumpered together if they are not shipped that way from the factory. Likewise, H2 and H3 should be jumpered together on the 480V side, with H1 jumpered to one of the fuse block's lugs, and H4 jumpered to a connector that also is jumpered to the transformer's grounding stud \\-\\- there will need to be two ports left on this connector, as both neutral and ground will connect to it. (It serves as a *bonding point* for the *separately derived system* created by the pole\\-transformer, in other words.)\n\nWe then move onto the cabin \\-\\- the H2 and H3 terminals are jumpered together on the cabin\\-transformer, taking care of the primary side for now. The X2 and X3 terminals on the cabin\\-transformer are jumpered together and also connected to the *neutral* wire running off to the cabin's loadcenter, which is taped white, while the X1 and X4 terminals each connect to one hot wire running off to the cabin's loadcenter. In the loadcenter, the white\\-taped neutral wire from X2/X3 lands on the neutral lug, while the wires from X1 and X4 individually land on one hot lug of the main breaker each, and the bonding screw or strap is *installed* if it is not already present. Again, this is because the transformer is providing isolation from the rest of the mains\\-world for us, giving us a *separately derived system* at the cabin.\n\nAt this point, if all is going well, you will want to perform a test (or have an electrician perform a test for you) *before* you make the final connections and energize this configuration. In particular, you or your electrician should perform an *insulation resistance test* using a special high\\-voltage insulation tester (often called a \"Megger\") on the long run of wires before hooking them up to at either end. This will show if the wires were damaged during the pulling process, preventing a nasty breakdown and fault\\-finding process down the road.\n\nOnce the wires pass such a test, you can then make the final connections. The yellow\\-taped hot wire in the long run connects to the open terminal on the fuse block, while the grey\\-taped neutral and green\\-taped ground wires go to the connector in the jumper from H4 to the transformer's ground stud. At this point, the fuse can be installed into the fuse block as well.\n\nMoving on to the final connections at the cabin, we then hook the yellow\\-taped hot wire up to the H1 terminal on the cabin\\-transformer and the grey\\-taped neutral wire up to the H4 terminal on the cabin\\-transformer. Last but not least, the green\\-taped ground wire gets hooked up to the ground lug on the cabin\\-transformer.\n\nAs to the rest of the cabin\n---------------------------\n\nThe rest of the cabin is wired the same way either way. You will need a grounding electrode system at the cabin in any case, and the panel at the cabin must have a main breaker in it to serve as a shutoff, whether it is a subpanel (in the conventional approach) or a main panel (in the transformer approach). Furthermore, there is no sense in being stingy on panel spaces here \\-\\- I would use a 100 or 125A, 30 space, main breaker panel at the cabin if I were in your shoes, as adding breaker spaces later is far more expensive."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a scenario where power needs to be supplied from a 200A breaker box to a cabin 530 feet away, which of the following approaches would be most cost-effective while addressing voltage drop concerns?\n\nA) Use 3/0 aluminum XHHW-2 wire for a direct 240V run at 50A\nB) Install a pair of 15kVA dry-type distribution transformers to step up voltage to 480V for transmission\nC) Use 250kcmil aluminum wire for a direct 240V run at 60A\nD) Run the entire distance using 2\" Schedule 80 PVC conduit with 4AWG copper wire\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the most cost-effective solution that addresses voltage drop concerns. By using a pair of 15kVA dry-type distribution transformers, the voltage can be stepped up to 480V for transmission over the long distance and then stepped back down at the cabin. This allows for the use of smaller gauge wire (4AWG aluminum) and smaller conduit (1.5\"), significantly reducing material costs.\n\nOption A, while feasible, would require larger and more expensive wire due to voltage drop over the long distance.\n\nOption C would be even more expensive than A, as 250kcmil wire is larger and costlier than 3/0.\n\nOption D is incorrect because 4AWG copper would be insufficient for the required ampacity over that distance, and using copper instead of aluminum would unnecessarily increase costs.\n\nThe transformer approach, despite the initial cost of the transformers, ends up being about $1000 cheaper than the conventional approach due to savings on wire and conduit costs."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/05/12", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/304919", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/72659/"], "docs_id": 304919, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I can see that most of the gadgets that use proprietary protocols use 433MHz, 915MHz, or 2\\.45GHz, but I don't understand why. 433MHz is highly regulated in the US and 915MHz can not be used in Europe.

That is how it leads to unbiased estimates of the average treatment effect. But other assignment schemes can also systematically ensure independence of treatment from potential outcomes. So why do we need random assignment? Put another way, what is the advantage of random assignment over nonrandom assignment schemes that also lead to unbiased inference?\n\nLet $\\\\mathbf{Z}$ be a vector of treatment assignments in which each element is 0 (unit not assigned to treatment) or 1 (unit assigned to treatment). In a JASA article, [Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996, 446\\-47\\)](http://people.ucsc.edu/~cdobkin/Classes/Reza/Identification%20of%20Causal%20Effects%20Using%20Instrumental%20Variables%20%28Angrist%29.pdf) say that treatment assignment $Z\\_i$ is random if $\\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{Z} \\= \\\\mathbf{c}) \\= \\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{Z} \\= \\\\mathbf{c'})$ for all $\\\\mathbf{c}$ and $\\\\mathbf{c'}$ such that $\\\\iota^T\\\\mathbf{c} \\= \\\\iota^T\\\\mathbf{c'}$, where $\\\\iota$ is a column vector with all elements equal to 1\\.\n\nIn words, the claim is that assignment $Z\\_i$ is random if any vector of assignments that includes $m$ assignments to treatment is as likely as any other vector that includes $m$ assignments to treatment.\n\nBut, to ensure independence of potential outcomes from treatment assignment, it suffices to ensure that each unit in the study has equal probability of assignment to treatment. And that can easily occur even if most treatment assignment vectors have *zero* probability of being selected. That is, it can occur even under nonrandom assignment. \n\nHere is an example. We want to run an experiment with four units in which exactly two are treated. There are six possible assignment vectors:\n\n1. 1100\n2. 1010\n3. 1001\n4. 0110\n5. 0101\n6. 0011\n\nwhere the first digit in each number indicates whether the first unit was treated, the second digit indicates whether the second unit was treated, and so on.\n\nSuppose that we run an experiment in which we exclude the possibility of assignment vectors 3 and 4, but in which each of the other vectors has equal (25%) chance of being chosen. This scheme is not random assignment in the AIR sense. But in expectation, it leads to an unbiased estimate of the average treatment effect. And that is no accident. Any assignment scheme that gives subjects equal probability of assignment to treatment will permit unbiased estimation of the ATE.\n\nSo: why do we need random assignment in the AIR sense? My argument is rooted in randomization inference; if one thinks instead in terms of model\\-based inference, does the AIR definition seem more defensible?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This follows up on gung's comment. Overall average treatment effect is not the point.\n\nSuppose you have $1000$ new diabetes cases where the subject is between the ages of $5$ and $15$, and $1000$ new diabetes patients over $30$. You want to assign half to treatment. Why not flip a coin, and on heads, treat all of the young patients, and on tails, treat all of the older patients? Each would have a $50\\\\%$ chance to be selected fro treatment, so this would not bias the average result of the treatment, but it would throw away a lot of information. It would not be a surprise if juvenile diabetes or younger patients turned out to respond much better or worse than older patients with either type II or gestational diabetes. The observed treatment effect might be unbiased but, for example, it would have a much larger standard deviation than would occur through random assignment, and despite the large sample you would not be able to say much. If you use random assignment, then with high probability about $500$ cases in each age group would get the treatment, so you would be able to compare treatment with no treatment within each age group. \n\nYou may be able to do better than to use random assignment. If you notice a factor you think might affect the response to treatment, you might want to ensure that subjects with that attribute are split more evenly than would occur through random assignment. Random assignment lets you do reasonably well with all factors simultaneously, so that you can analyze many possible patterns afterwards."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a clinical trial for a new diabetes treatment, researchers have 1000 patients aged 5-15 and 1000 patients over 30.

Here's why:\n\nA) While this method gives each patient a 50% chance of receiving treatment, it doesn't allow for comparison within age groups and could miss important age-related effects.\n\nB) This is the best option as it ensures a balanced representation of both age groups in the treatment and control groups. It allows for analysis of treatment effects both overall and within each age group, maximizing the information gained from the study.\n\nC) This introduces selection bias, as patients who choose treatment may differ systematically from those who don't, compromising the study's validity.\n\nD) This method, while seemingly random, could introduce bias if there are any systematic differences related to birth date (e.g., seasonal effects on health).\n\nRandom assignment (option B) allows for unbiased estimation of treatment effects and enables researchers to control for potential confounding factors like age in this case.

This is derived by finding the differential equation in terms of current by using KVL.\n\nIs this true that the current in the circuit consisting of an inductor, a capacitor and a resistor(all in series) is zero too at the time just after closing the switch? I tried writing a differential equation and solving it but it consists of functions of Q and it derivative and its double derivative, which I cannot solve.\n\nWhat and how can I conclude about the current in this circuit just after switch is closed. \n(Consider that the switch was opened for a long time before closing) ![The equation I derived ](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zBulQ.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So, we have series LCR circuit. $V$ is a constant voltage source. $L$, $C$, and $R$ represents the inductance, capacitance and resistance in the circuit respectively. A current $I$ flows through the circuit. \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FKfbK.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FKfbK.png) \n\nNow, the current through each component is the same. So, the potential difference between each component added up together gives the emf $V$. Hence the differential equation becomes: \n\n$$L\\\\frac{dI}{dt}\\+\\\\frac{Q}{C}\\+IR\\=V$$ \n\nwhere $Q$ is the charge on the capacitor and is related to the current by $I\\=\\\\displaystyle{\\\\frac{dQ}{dt}}$. This means we have only one unknown in the equation if we replace all $I$ in terms of $Q$: \n\n$$L\\\\frac{d^2Q}{dt^2}\\+R\\\\frac{dQ}{dt}\\+\\\\frac{Q}{C}\\=V$$ \n\nwhich is a second order differential equation. Differentiating again w.r.t $t$ and rewriting in terms of $I$, we get \n\n$$L\\\\frac{d^2I}{dt^2}\\+R\\\\frac{dI}{dt}\\+\\\\frac{I}{C}\\=\\\\frac{dV}{dt}$$ \n\nSince we have a constant dc voltage source, $\\\\displaystyle{\\\\frac{dV}{dt}\\=0}$. Hence \n\n$$L\\\\frac{d^2I}{dt^2}\\+R\\\\frac{dI}{dt}\\+\\\\frac{I}{C}\\=0$$ \n\nDividing throughout by $L$, we have \n\n$$\\\\frac{d^2I}{dt^2}\\+\\\\frac{R}{L}\\\\frac{dI}{dt}\\+\\\\frac{I}{LC}\\=0$$ or \n\n$$\\\\frac{d^2I}{dt^2}\\+2\\\\alpha\\\\frac{dI}{dt}\\+\\\\omega\\_0^2 I\\=0$$ \n\nwhere $\\\\displaystyle{\\\\alpha\\=\\\\frac{R}{2L}}$ and $\\\\displaystyle{\\\\omega\\_0\\=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{LC}}}$\n\nThis is an ODE with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation of this differential equation is given by: \n\n$$s^2\\+2\\\\alpha s\\+\\\\omega\\_0^2\\=0$$ \n\nThe roots of this equation in $s$ are: \n\n$s\\_1\\=\\-\\\\alpha \\+\\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha^2\\-\\\\omega^2}$ and $s\\_2\\=\\-\\\\alpha \\-\\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha^2\\-\\\\omega^2}$ \n\nThe general solution is given by: \n\n$$I(t)\\=A\\_1e^{s\\_1t}\\+A\\_2e^{s\\_2t}$$. \n\nNow, at $t\\=0$, let the current be zero. On switching on the current, then the current rises to a maximum value exponentially. Otherwise, it takes a finite time for the current to have a constant value in the circuit . The current will not instantly rises to a maximum value. This is due to the presence of inductance and capacitance in the circuit.

In an LCR circuit connected to a DC source, the current does not instantly rise to its maximum value when the switch is closed. Instead, it starts from zero at t=0+ and then gradually increases. This behavior is due to the presence of both inductance and capacitance in the circuit.\n\nThe current follows the solution I(t) = A\u2081e^(s\u2081t) + A\u2082e^(s\u2082t), where s\u2081 and s\u2082 are the roots of the characteristic equation s\u00b2 + 2\u03b1s + \u03c9\u2080\u00b2 = 0. These roots are given by s\u2081 = -\u03b1 + \u221a(\u03b1\u00b2 - \u03c9\u00b2) and s\u2082 = -\u03b1 - \u221a(\u03b1\u00b2 - \u03c9\u00b2), where \u03b1 = R/(2L) and \u03c9\u2080 = 1/\u221a(LC).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the current doesn't instantly jump to its maximum value.

The project was originally developed in Visual C++ 6.0, and the client has requested new features that require transparency (alpha) components in colors. The development team discovers that the required functionality is not available in the current version. Which of the following approaches is most appropriate for explaining the limitations to a non-technical client?\n\nA) Create a detailed technical report outlining the differences between GDI and GDI+ libraries, including code samples and API documentation.\n\nB) Ignore the limitations and attempt to implement the requested features using only the available tools in VC++ 6.0, potentially compromising the quality of the final product.\n\nC) Use an analogy, such as \"You can't build a house first and a chimney later,\" to explain why certain features cannot be added to the existing codebase without significant changes.\n\nD) Insist that the client learn programming concepts to understand the technical limitations of the current development environment.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: When dealing with non-technical clients, it's important to communicate technical limitations in a way that is easy to understand. Using an analogy, such as \"You can't build a house first and a chimney later,\" helps illustrate the concept that certain features may require fundamental changes to the existing structure. This approach is more effective than presenting overly technical information (A), ignoring limitations (B), or expecting the client to learn programming (D).

Thank you\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm going to provide a Bayesian approach.\n\nLet $y$ be the error between the measurement and the truth. If you're willing to make assumptions about the error (maybe that the measurement is biased in some way, that bias needs estimation, and there is additional noise in the process) it may be possible to select a distribution with which to model the errors. Let's assume for the sake of exposition that a Student t distribution is good enough for our purposes, but any distribution will do.\n\nThe model is then\n\n$$ y \\\\sim B \\+ \\\\epsilon $$\n\nHere $B$ is the bias of the measurement and $\\\\epsilon$ is a student t random variable with some degree of freedom, $\\\\nu$, which requires estimation from the data. There are two sources of variation we need to account for: variation in the estimate of $B$ *as well* as variation in the estimate of the degrees of freedom for $\\\\epsilon$ (or whatever other parameter is used in your choice or error distribution. This could be $\\\\sigma$ if you were to use a normal distribution).\n\nTo provide an interval estimator, we can leverage the *posterior predictive distribution* [which I have talked about in this post](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/558859/is-the-t-test-to-test-the-difference-from-0/558862#558862). IN essence, we will draw values of $B$ and $\\\\nu$ from our posterior and then use those to simulate new data from our likelihood. Once we do that a couple thousand times, we can summarize the resulting distribution using quantiles to give an interval estimator.\n\nHere is how we might do this with your data\n\n```\nlibrary(brms)\n\n# Data you have provided\nerrors = c(-7.62, -9.33, -8.36, -9.79,-10.45, -9.51, -10.83, -10.64, -9.96, -10.30)\nd = data.frame(errors)\n\n# Fit a Bayesian model with a student t error\nmodel = brm(errors~1, data = d, family = student())\n\n# Sample from the posterior predictive\nposterior_predictions = posterior_predict(model, newdata = list(1))\n\n# Summarize a 95% credible interval \nquantile(posterior_predictions, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))\n\n      2.5%      97.5% \n-12.377867  -7.049977 \n\n```\n\nThe result is an interval which contains 95% probability for seeing a new observation given the model specification. That's our uncertainty in the prediction. We can also summarize our uncertainty in the bias (much like a confidence interval) in a similar way\n\n```\n\nB = posterior_samples(model, pars = 'Intercept')[, 1]\nquantile(B, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))\n     2.5%      97.5% \n-10.439664  -8.974423 \n\nmean(B)\n[1] -9.72698\n\n```\n\nSo our estimate of the bias is \\-9\\.76 (this will depedn on how many samples you use as well as a few other things not worth mentioning here) and our uncertainty in that bias is given by the credible interval (\\-10\\.44 \\-\\- \\-8\\.97\\).\n\nThe benefit of this approach is integrating over all uncertainty in the model, not *just* uncertainty in the parameters the model as would be done with a frequentist prediction interval.

With this in mind I think it would make sense to find out about the differences in the amount / rate of \"good\" questions (defined as say, open with non\\-negative score).\n\n---\n\nGiven that registration presumably simplifies handling of [question bans](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/tags/post-ban/info \"what's this\") I think it would be particularly interesting to estimate if there was a difference in amount (rate) of such bans.\n\nIt would be also interesting to study the difference in \"ban failure rate\", which could be estimated as percentage of users caught at attempts to overcome it: those who created fake accounts that were later discovered and merged into original banned account.\n\n* It looks quite simple how to get upper bound of detected attempts to abuse question ban. First, let's count how many accounts were added in last 4 months, as of Jan 12 these are roughly between [62044](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/62044) and [78338](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/78338), `78338-62044=16294`. Now if we find how many of these accounts are gone, as indicated by respective user profile being `404 Not Found`, this will give us how many accounts were either self\\-deleted, or gone through legitimate merges, or... **and this is exactly what I'd want to estimate**... or were merged as a result of detected abuse of question ban.

But, here's a picture for gnat:\n\n![User creation and deletion](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cVcBn.png)\n\nThe best reason for doing this is probably just the slight bit of extra resistance it provides, and the somewhat fewer headaches involved in having registered accounts (both for the asker, and the folks interacting with him). I wouldn't turn it off again, but I wouldn't encourage sites with less traffic to enable it either. \n\nAs an aside, we're working on changes to the registration system that should help to *encourage* folks to register their accounts without *requiring* it \\- this should ease the transition elsewhere. \n\n\\*closed, deleted, or down\\-voted below 0\\."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the data provided, what was the primary impact of implementing a registration requirement for asking questions on Programmers (now Software Engineering Stack Exchange)?\n\nA) It significantly reduced the total number of questions asked on the site\nB) It eliminated all low-quality questions from unregistered users\nC) It slightly improved the effectiveness of the quality ban system\nD) It dramatically decreased the percentage of bad questions from registered users\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The data shows that implementing the registration requirement did not significantly reduce the overall number of questions or completely eliminate low-quality questions.

The 'change' event is the appropriate event to use for select elements when you want to detect when a user selects a new option. The 'select' event is used for text selection in input elements, not for option selection in dropdowns. Option A incorrectly uses the 'select' event for select elements. Option C uses the 'focus' event, which would fire when the select element gains focus, not when an option is selected. Option D incorrectly targets input elements instead of select elements and uses the wrong event type."}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/03/31", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/64056", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/13020/"], "docs_id": 64056, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As a programmer, I enjoy embarking on small personal projects and I have a load of open source scripts that I host on github.

Can someone point out to me what I am doing wrong? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The SRID has been set already on your point.\n\nYou need to transform the SRID, not set it, after you rotate it:\n\n```\nSELECT ST_Translate( ST_Transform( ST_Rotate( ST_Scale( ST_Buffer( ST_SetSRID( ST_Point(0,0), 3395), 0.5, $6), $3, $4), $5), 4326), $1, $2) \n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When creating an ellipse function in PostGIS that takes latitude, longitude, and ellipse dimensions in meters as inputs, which of the following function modifications is most appropriate to ensure the ellipse is correctly sized and positioned?\n\nA) Add ST_Transform() after ST_Rotate() to convert from EPSG:3395 to EPSG:4326\nB) Use ST_SetSRID() instead of ST_Transform() to set the final coordinate system\nC) Apply ST_Scale() before ST_Buffer() to adjust the ellipse dimensions\nD) Remove all SRID transformations and work entirely in EPSG:4326\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is correct because it addresses the key issue in the original function.

For instance, is there a way a user could disable its use, and thus disable my script? If yes, what are my other options?\n\nThanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The mechanism to use depends upon your goals.\n\nIf you wish to provide something *convenient* or *friendly* for your users, then your `/etc/profile` is reasonable enough if all your users use the same shell. If you want the commands to execute *only* when logging in via `ssh`, place commands into `/etc/ssh/sshrc`. (If you don't mind users overriding the commands with their own `~/.ssh/rc` file.)\n\nIf you want to *force* a user to execute one program, *and only one program*, then the `ForceCommand` option as described by DigitalRoss is a good approach. (I personally would further confine the user with a [mandatory access control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control) system such as [AppArmor](http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor/), [SELinux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux), [TOMOYO](http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/index.html.en), or [SMACK](http://schaufler-ca.com/), to ensure the program can not allow a user to escape. I've worked on AppArmor for ten years, so that's the tool I'd pick first, but the others are fine tools written by excellent programmers.)\n\nIf you just want one program to execute *and not bother the user in any way*, then the best approach is to use the `pam_exec(8)` module, which cannot be bypassed, works regardless of shell, and provides easy ability to run as the user or as the user account of the program performing the authorization. The manpage gives the following example:\n\n```\n   Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/passwd to rebuild the\n   NIS database after each local password change:\n\n               passwd optional pam_exec.so seteuid make -C /var/yp\n\n   This will execute the command\n\n       make -C /var/yp\n\n   with effective user ID.\n\n```\n\nThis could be extended to run on `auth`, `account`, `password`, and `session` actions; probably `session` would be best for executing upon log in. Just add a line like:\n\n```\nsession optional pam_exec.so log=/var/log/ssh_login_cmd /usr/local/bin/ssh_cmd\n\n```\n\nto your `/etc/pam.d/sshd` control file."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator wants to execute a script every time a user logs in via SSH, with access to the username and IP address of the person logging in.

It works regardless of the user's shell, cannot be overridden by user configurations, and can be set to execute silently without interfering with the user's session.
