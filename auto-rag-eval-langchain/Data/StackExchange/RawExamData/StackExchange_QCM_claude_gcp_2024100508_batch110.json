It would insert the new row as the first child of 'tr_second', which doesn't meet the requirement of inserting after the specified row.\n\nC) .after() - This is the correct method to use. It inserts content immediately after the selected element, which in this case would place the new row directly after the 'tr_second' row, maintaining proper table structure.\n\nD) .insertAfter() - While this method would also work correctly, it has a slightly different syntax where the content to be inserted comes first in the method call. It's a valid alternative but not as commonly used as .after() for this specific scenario.\n\nThe correct choice is .after() as it directly addresses the requirement of inserting the new row immediately after the specified existing row, maintaining the proper structure of the table."}, "10": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/05/23", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/115271", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/69776/"], "docs_id": 115271, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When a pinch crimp has to be removed and re\\-done, what is the proper tool to remove the PEX pipe from a barb after removing the clamp and cutting of the pipe? \n\nI thought of using the PEX pipe cutter's blade but am afraid it would mar the ribs on the barb and cause a leak when it's subsequently re\\-used.\n\nIn my particular case I am using a 3/4 elbow like this with a PEX pipe which is white on the o/s and black on the i/s if it matters.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Ya1a.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Ya1a.jpg)\n\nSo if I had to undo and re\\-do this kind of connection, I would open one of the pinch rings and cut off the pipe, but don't know how to remove what's left under the former crimp:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/K9j2G.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/K9j2G.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would use a utility knife to score the pipe.

But when it comes the time to do riemannian geometry they leave all that nice machinery and just talk about the Riemann tensor, sectional curvature, Jacobi's equation and the first and second variations of engergy. \n\nSo, isn't there a way to tackle the classic problems in global riemannian geometry (for example the theorems that one can see in do Carmo's book) with Cartan's methods using moving frames? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Moving frames and differential forms are primarily useful for exact formal pointwise computations involving local differential invariants of a geometric structure (such as a Riemannian metric) and proving theorems that follow from such computations. An example might be the uniqueness of Riemannian metrics with constant sectional curvature. An impressive amount of differential geometry can be studied in this way, as shown in the work of Elie Cartan, S. S. Chern (see, for example, his papers generalizing Gauss\\-Bonnet and constructing Chern classes), and Robert Bryant.\n\nThe approach is less useful when working globally or semiglobally and when studying geometric inequalities rather than exact identities. The power of studying Jacobi fields along geodesics lies in the comparison theorems that originate in Sturm\\-Liouville theory. Here, formal computations are needed only to reduce the original geometric setup to a self\\-adjoint linear second order ODE, and the computations are best done with respect to a properly chosen orthonormal frame of vector fields (parallel along geodesics). The Cartan differential form approach is less convenient here.\n\nThe same is true when considering variational formulas for various energy integrals that are useful in differential geometry. It is possible to do the computation using differential forms and the formula for the Lie derivative, but for most of us find it more natural to work with vector fields and/or local co\\-ordinates when doing these computations.\n\nThe upshot, as I have already said elsewhere, is that I find it quite handy to be able to do computations using any of the different approaches and choose the one that feels most comfortable at any given moment."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the limitations of using moving frames and differential forms in Riemannian geometry?\n\nA) They are ineffective for proving theorems about local differential invariants of geometric structures.\n\nB) They cannot be used to study constant sectional curvature or generalize the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.\n\nC) They are less convenient for global or semi-global analysis and for studying geometric inequalities.\n\nD) They are incompatible with the study of Jacobi fields along geodesics.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA is incorrect because moving frames and differential forms are actually very effective for exact formal pointwise computations involving local differential invariants.\n\nB is incorrect as the text specifically mentions that these methods can be used to prove uniqueness of Riemannian metrics with constant sectional curvature and to generalize the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.\n\nC is correct.

So we look at the `double` class and begin designing. It obviously has no inputs (other than the instance) and returns a `double`. We write and test the code. Perfection.\n\nBut taking the square root of an integer is valid, too, and we don't want to force everyone to convert to a double just to take a square root. So we move to `int` and start designing. What does it return? We *could* return an `int` and make it work only for perfect squares, or round the result to the nearest `int` (ignoring the debate about the proper rounding method for now). But what if someone wants a non\\-integer result? Should we have two methods \\- one that returns an `int` and one that returns a `double` (which is not possible in some languages without changing the name). So we decide that it should return a `double`. Now we implement. But the implementation is identical to the one we used for `double`. Do we copy\\-and\\-paste?

To be read with the following associative priorities: \"pointer to \" \"a function returning T\".\n\nThe wording avoids to say the name of the function, since the rule is anything that designates a function, including a dereferenced function pointer.\n\nExample, with T being `void`:\n\n```\nvoid f(){ printf(\"Oops\\n\");}\n\nint main(void) {\n    void (*pf1)(), (*pf2)(); \n    void (*a[3])();  \n\n    pf2 = &f;   // &f is the address of f, so a pointer to a function returning void\n    pf1 = f;    // f is a function designator,  it's converted to a function pointer\n    a[0]=f;     // same, but for the fun it's stored in an array of function pointers\n    printf (\"%lx %lx %lx %lx %lx\\n\", f, &f,  pf1, pf2, a[0]);  // all the same\n    pf2();      // will call the function as well.  pf2 is already a function pointer\n\n    (*pf1)();     // here we see that *pf1 is also a function designator\n    pf2 = *pf1;   // *pf1 is converted to a function pointer, so it's pf1   \n    printf (\"%lx %lx\\n\", pf1, pf2);    // all the same \n\n    (***************pf1)(); // Sorry: I couldn't resist ;-)\n\n    return 0;\n} \n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Consider the following code snippet:\n\n```c\nvoid foo() { printf(\"Hello\"); }\nvoid (*bar)();\nvoid (*baz[1])();\n\nint main() {\n    bar = foo;\n    baz[0] = foo;\n    printf(\"%p %p %p %p\\n\", foo, &foo, bar, baz[0]);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nWhat will be the relationship between the printed addresses?\n\nA) All addresses will be different\nB) Only the address of foo and &foo will be the same, others will be different\nC) All addresses will be the same\nD) The addresses of foo, bar, and baz[0] will be the same, but &foo will be different\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of function designators and their conversion to function pointers. According to the C11 standard, a function designator (like 'foo' in this case) is converted to a pointer to the function when used in most contexts. \n\nIn this code:\n- 'foo' is a function designator that gets converted to a function pointer\n- '&foo' explicitly takes the address of the function, which is the same as the function pointer\n- 'bar' is assigned the function pointer of 'foo'\n- 'baz[0]' is also assigned the function pointer of 'foo'\n\nTherefore, all four printed values will be the same address - the address of the function 'foo'. This demonstrates that in most contexts, a function designator, its address, and pointers to the function all resolve to the same value.\n\nThe tricky part is recognizing that '&foo' doesn't create a different address - it's the same as the function pointer, which might be counterintuitive to some students."}, "20": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/02/26", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/158589", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/97634/"], "docs_id": 158589, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just purchased a 1925 beautiful home that is stucco on the outside and old plaster on the inside. I have some carpentry experience and am realizing the incredible loss f heat to the exterior walls. There is ample space in each of the rooms in the house so I am contemplating ways to insulate. It seems blow in is too dangerous because of moisture issues.\n\nI am considering building new 2x4 insulated walls within the existing exterior walls. \n\nWhat do you think?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I wouldn\u2019t. You can create moisture and mold problems, much less drastically change the size and character of the interior of your home. \n\nAdding an insulated wall on the interior of your home will change the \u201cperm\u201d rating of your exterior wall. Perm rating is important because it controls the flow of VAPOR through the wall. \n\nDepending on where you live, vapor will travel from the inside out (northern climates) or from the outside in (southern climates) or both ways (middle climates). When vapor travels through the wall, it changes from a vapor to a liquid. If this liquid gets trapped in the wall, it will create rot and mold. [Here is an article](https://americas.siga.swiss/blog/building-science/do-you-need-know-what-perm-rating-is) that explains it better.\n\nAll materials have a perm rating... even a coat of paint. [Here\u2019s an article](https://www.buildingscience.com/documents/information-sheets/info-312-vapor-permeance-some-materials) that lists some materials and explains it better. Adding additional materials could trap moisture within the two walls and create rot and mold. \n\nIf you\u2019re trying to save heat and reduce your heating costs, I\u2019d concentrate on 1\\) adding insulation in your attic, 2\\) sealing drafts around windows and doors, etc., and then 3\\) insulate your exterior walls. \n\n1. Heat rises, so concentrating on the ceiling makes sense. (The Department of Energy has a website that explains this.)\n2. Drafts will lower the room temperature dramatically and keep your furnace working.\n3. Yes, due to the age of your home, I doubt if they have any insulation in your exterior walls.

Without it, our load calculation looks like the following:\n\n* 1250 ft\u00b2 \\* 3VA/ft\u00b2 \\= 3750VA of general lighting/receptacle load from NEC 220\\.12/220\\.14(J), and\n* 3 small appliance branch circuits (2 kitchen countertop, 1 laundry) give us 4500VA of SABC load from NEC 220\\.52(A)/(B)\n\nwhich gives us 4838VA of factored general load (using the 35% demand factor for general \\+ SABC loads over 3kVA, as per).\n\nThen, atop that 4838VA of factored general load, we add our heavy appliances:\n\n* 8kVA for a range under 12kVA as per Table 220\\.55 Column C for a single range (let us know if your range is bigger than that)\n* 4\\.5kVA for the water heater, and\n* 5kVA for the dryer as per NEC 220\\.54\n\nwhich gives us a reasonable 22338VA, or 93A @ 240VAC, for your house *before* we add the electric resistance heat. However, that 60\\+kBTU/hr of resistance heat, by itself, takes up 3800VA \\* 5 heaters \\* 1\\.25 due to continuous load factoring (NEC 424\\.3(B)). This adds up to 23\\.75kVA of load, or another 99A at 240VAC; atop that, it's also a NEC violation *right now* as NEC 230\\.23(A) requires services to be large enough to handle their Article 220 calculated loads:\n\n> **230\\.23 Size and Rating.**\n> \n> \n> **(A) General.** Conductors shall have sufficient ampacity to\n> carry the current for the load as calculated in accordance with\n> Article 220 and shall have adequate mechanical strength.\n\nThe answer to the question you should be asking, but haven't yet, is a *heat pump*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHowever, those space heaters just won't cut it for keeping the whole house warm, especially during a cold snap where at\\-risk piping can easily freeze up and make a mess. As a result of that, homeowners insurers require working central heating systems, and so do the building codes, for that matter. In the IRC, this requirement is found in R303\\.10 (the Table R301\\.2 reference is really a reference to the 99% temperature from the ACCA Manual J tables):\n\n> **R303\\.10 Required heating.**\n> \n> \n> Where the winter design temperature in Table R301\\.2 is below 60\u00b0F (16\u00b0C), every *dwelling unit* shall be provided with heating facilities capable of maintaining a room temperature of not less than 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C) at a point 3 feet (914mm) above the floor and 2 feet (610mm) from exterior walls in habitable rooms at the design temperature. The installation of one or more portable space heaters shall not be used to acheive compliance with this section.\n\nThe question then is \"how can you heat your house without consuming most of your service?\" Fortunately, heat pump technology has made leaps and bounds since the early days; today's *mini\\-split* heat pumps can defrost without strip heat and have efficiency ratings that put most of the air conditioners you're used to seeing to shame. Furthermore, you can get them in capacities up to 5 tons (60kBTU) nowadays, with either a single large indoor unit similar to a conventional air handler feeding a full duct system, or multiple smaller indoor units that either feed flat \"pancake\" ducts or serve single rooms/areas.\n\nSo, given that your manual J design temperatures are around 40\u00b0F, I'd get someone qualified to run an ACCA Manual J, Eighth Edition calculation on your house, and then have them use Manual S to size a new heat pump from there. This will let you decommission all those costly resistance heaters and enjoy *both* efficient, reliable heat in the winter *and* air conditioning in the summer. And when I say efficient, I mean *more than twice as efficient* as your resistance heat; using a LG LMU600HV as an example, it consumes a mere 32\\.2A @ 230VAC, or just over 9\\.25kVA of load. Keep in mind that this is essentially a *worst case* figure; real\\-world numbers will be better than this, especially if you can leverage some envelope upgrades (insulation, air\\-sealing) to knock your heating load down further.\n\nBut, those car charger plans *also* call for a service upgrade\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile replacing the resistance heaters with a heat pump gets you back within the realm of what your existing 125A service can handle, adding that 40A or 50A car charger load (really, 32A or 40A times 1\\.25\\) to the picture is enough to put you well over 125A of service ampacity. So, in order to cover that, you'll need to have a service upgrade done *anyway*; the good news is that getting rid of those glorified toasters lets you upgrade to a relatively inexpensive 200A service instead of forcing you into much costlier Class 320 service hardware.\n\nWhen you're having the electrician put the service upgrade in, make sure that you get plenty of *panel spaces*; while the extra kitchen branch circuits don't add much load, they do take up a fair few spaces, and nobody *ever* complains about having too much room in their panel! In fact, I'd go with a 40\\-space or 42\\-space panel as a *minimum* specification for this service upgrade; if you can get a 54\\-space or 60\\-space panel, or a pair of 40\\-space or 42\\-space panels either fed in parallel from a meter\\-main or daisy\\-chained together, that's even better."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is upgrading a 125-amp main panel in a 1250 sq ft townhouse.

This approach, described by Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch, involves calculating the partial derivative of the coefficients with respect to the weight of each observation, evaluated at w_i = 1.

From my understanding of the Geohash algorithm you can't just select all the points inside a given bounding box by simple string comparison.\n\nThis image might help understanding it a bit better:\n\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/J6LYk.jpg)  \n\n(image from [http://www.movable\\-type.co.uk/scripts/geohash.jpg](http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/geohash.jpg))\n\nIf you have a bounding box going covering a region in Canada for instance within the `c` and `f` regions, string comparison would necessarily select regions in `d` and `e` regions as well, which are geographically at a very different place. So if you are able to design a correct query, it would probably be close to a Geohash decoding algorithm which is computationally quite expensive for big data sets.\n\nFor your question regarding a simple clustering algorithm, the problem is similar. Clustering algorithms all work based on some distance metrics. And a Geohash does not provide a generic way for conveniently computing the geographical distance between two far\\-away hashes.\n\nHowever there are probably two paths you can take.\n\nOne option is to store your data (maybe additionally to the Geohash format, depending on your requirements), in simple indexed lat and lng columns, or as geometries (with a spatial index). In the case of using geometries, you can use the [Spatial Relation Functions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/spatial-relation-functions-mbr.html) in MySQL (e.g. `MBRContains`).\n\nThe other option is if you only want to cluster the markers in Leaflet, similarly to the Leaflet MarkerClusterer, you could just group by the first character in the Geohash for zoom level 0\\. For more fine grained clustering, you might need more computation and be better off with the previous option."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are developing a web application that needs to display clustered markers on a map.

Damage improvement: **32%**.\n* Enchanting your weapon would also give you \\+5 to accuracy[1](http://brogue.wikia.com/wiki/Combat), increasing it from 75 to 80\\. I consider this negligible.\n\n32% more damage means you'll be able to kill monsters in 32% less time, meaning you'll take 32% less damage from them in melee. How does this fare against the leather armor?\n\n* When unenchanted, the leather armor gives you **\\+3\\.5** protection (\\+3 intrinsic and \\+0\\.5 excess strength bonus).\n* When enchanted, the leather armor gives you **\\+4\\.75** protection (\\+4 intrinsic and \\+0\\.75 excess strength bonus).\n* Unenchanted: \\+3\\.5\\. Enchanted: \\+4\\.75\\. Armor improvement: **35%**. The wiki says \"Every point of armor gives you another 13% chance to dodge a monster's attacks.\"[1](http://brogue.wikia.com/wiki/Combat) So it improves your dodging chance from 45\\.5% to 61\\.8%.\n\nIn principle, **it seems roughly as beneficial to enchant either the dagger or the armor**, because you'll end up taking 32\\-35% less damage with either (because, as Ids said, killing monsters faster also means they'll have less time to damage you). Enchanting the armor would also protect you against arrow turrets and non\\-magical ranged attacks, while enchanting the dagger would give you a better chance against armored and/or regenerating monsters. Choose based on what kills you more often.\n\nI would personally go for the darts, though.\n\n* Unenchanted darts give you an attack bonus of **\\+0\\.5** (\\+0 intrinsic\nand \\+0\\.5 excess strength bonus), for a total of **2\\.5\\-4\\.5** damage.\n* Enchanted darts give you **\\+1\\.75** (\\+1 intrinsic and \\+0\\.75\nexcss strength), for a total of **3\\.75\\-5\\.75** damage.\n* Unenchanted average: 3\\.5; enchanted average: 4\\.75\\. Damage improvement: **35%**.\n\nThe numbers show that you gain as much damage as if you enchanted the dagger, so stats are not an issue. Obviously the big downside of darts is that you have a limited supply of them, and the big advantage is that unless you're lucky to find a staff of firebolt, lightning or poison early on, the darts will be your only ranged weapon for the entire early game.\n\nHere's my take. Having limited darts is not as bad if they're enchanted, because since they'll do 35% more damage (and they'll be 5% more accurate), you won't be wasting as many of them on monkeys and the like. You'll be able to save them for pit bloats, acid mounds, and other nasty monsters that you have no reliable way of dealing with in melee. Enchanting your dagger or armor will make most of the early game a little easier, but enchanting your darts might save your life.\n\nIt's also a lot harder to find more darts than it is to find better weapons and armor, such as the scale mail (12 str, \\+4 armor) or the spear (13 str, 4\\-5 damage). So darts it is.\n\nIds brings up a great point, though: you can now identify scrolls of enchantment. Therefore, you should not only think of what you'll do with the one you just used, but also think about how you'll use the ones you're bound to find later. You will have a better chance of enchanting more powerful items than the dagger or leather armor, or perhaps a staff of firebolt, so chances are that you won't keep the armor or the dagger for long anyway."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the game Brogue, a player finds a scroll of enchantment early in the game when they only have a dagger, leather armor, and 15 darts.

If we introduce a function $$f(C)\\=\\\\frac{160(25\\\\cdot 10^6C^2\\-2\\\\cdot 10^4C\\+3\\)}{2\u22c510^8C^2\u22126\u22c510^4C\\+9}$$, minimum value of **f(C)** is $$\\\\frac{\\-40}{3}$$ at $$C\\=3\\\\cdot 10^{\\-4}F.$$ So, maximum power factor is for **C\\=0\\.0003F**.\n\n**Question**: Is this correct?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The correct answer is obtained by making **the absolute value of the imaginary part of the total equivalent impedance** as small as possible (explanation follows below). If possible, make it zero, as this will yield the maximum possible power factor, which is one.\n\nIn your case, assuming you did all the delta\\-wye and wye\\-delta conversions correctly (I didn't check that), then the correct answer is given by setting the imaginary part of \\\\$Z\\_3\\\\$ to zero, that is:\n$$\n25\u22c510^6 C^2 \u2212 2\u22c510^4 C \\+ 3 \\= 0\n$$\nwhich, as you mention in the comments to another reply, yields two valid solutions, \\\\$C\\=6\u00b710^{\\-4} F\\\\$ and \\\\$C\\=2\u00b710^{\\-4} F\\\\$. If this equation had no positive roots, then you would have to look for a minimum of its absolute value.\n\nExplanation\n-----------\n\nWhen people talk about the power factor of a given device without any reference to the voltage and current applied to it, they are implicitly thinking about connecting it to an ideal voltage source \\\\$V\\\\$. The expression for the apparent power consumed by the device in this simple circuit is \\\\$S\\=V I^\\*\\\\$, and the real power \\\\$P\\\\$ is just the real part of \\\\$S\\\\$. The power factor is defined as: \n$$\n\\\\cos\\\\phi \\= \\\\frac{P}{\\|S\\|}\n$$\nBy Ohm's law, \\\\$V\\=IZ\\\\$, therefore \\\\$S \\= V I^\\*\\= \\|I\\|^2 Z \\= \\|I\\|^2 R \\+ j\\|I\\|^2 X\\\\$. So the power factor can be written as:\n$$\n\\\\cos\\\\phi \\= \\\\frac{\\|I\\|^2 R}{\\|I\\|^2 \\\\sqrt{R^2\\+X^2}} \\= \\\\frac{R}{\\\\sqrt{R^2\\+X^2}}\n$$\nAs you can see, neither the voltage nor the current appear in the final expression. Also, in order to maximize the power factor (the original question), it becomes obvious that you need to minimize \\\\$\\|X\\|\\\\$. To be more precise, what maximizes the power factor is the minimization of the ratio \\\\$\\|X\\|/R\\\\$, because if we divide both numerator and denominator by R, we obtain:\n$$\n\\\\cos\\\\phi \\= \\\\frac{R}{\\\\sqrt{R^2\\+X^2}} \\= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1\\+(\\\\frac{X}{R})^2}}\n$$"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a three-phase system with complex impedance Z = R + jX, which of the following statements is correct regarding maximizing the power factor?\n\nA) The power factor is maximized when |X| is maximized\nB) The power factor is maximized when R is minimized\nC) The power factor is maximized when the ratio |X|/R is minimized\nD) The power factor is independent of the values of R and X\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The power factor in a three-phase system with complex impedance Z = R + jX is given by the formula:\n\ncos \u03c6 = R / sqrt(R^2 + X^2)\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\ncos \u03c6 = 1 / sqrt(1 + (X/R)^2)\n\nFrom this form, we can see that to maximize the power factor, we need to minimize the ratio |X|/R.

If so, as a physicist, I would appreciate providing some explanations using the, possibly, simplest example, a circle $S^2$.\n\nHere are my thoughts. Generally, for a manifold $\\\\mathcal M$, I see no problem in defining some 'distribution' $f(x)$ with $x\\\\in\\\\mathcal M$, such that ${\\\\int\\_{\\\\mathcal M} f(x)d\\\\mu(x)\\=}1$. Obviously, this definition is metric\\-dependent. Still, oftentimes we have a canonical definition of the metric, e.g. borrowed from $\\\\mathbb R^n$ in the case if some canonical embedding is given, which is often the case.\nHowever, we face serious difficulties when try to define 'averaged' quantities. (And in physics that's what we typically want to do).\n\nAssume, given some 'distribution' $f(\\\\vec{n})$, we want to calculate its mean value. One option would be to define it as follows:\n$$\n\\\\langle \\\\vec n \\\\rangle \\= \\\\dfrac{\\\\int \\\\limits\\_{S^2} \\\\vec{n} f(\\\\vec n) ds}{\\\\left\\|\\\\int \\\\limits\\_{S^2} \\\\vec{n} f(\\\\vec n) ds\\\\right\\|^2}\n$$\n\nThe good thing about this definition is that it gives somewhat expected results, especially in the case of sharply\\-peaked distributions. However, we immediately face a huge number of problems. First of all, there exist a wide range of 'distributions' for which $\\\\langle\\\\vec n\\\\rangle$ is undefined (all the shells whose center of mass is at the origin). Second, excluding such 'bad' 'distributions' from the consideration does not really save us, for such an exclusion may be be 'quantity'\\-dependent (were we averaging not $\\\\vec n$ but smth else, we would have to exclude other distributions). Moreover, even if we exclude all the 'bad' ones (for a particular quantity of interest), we still cannot even define the sum for the remaining 'good' ones, for, again, the sum of 'good' distributions may be a 'bad' one.\n\nOK, let's now consider a totally different approach suggested by the discrete probability theory. What is the mean value for the random variable which in a half cases gives $\\-1$, and in another half \\- $\\+1$? Well, clearly it's $0$, you would say. But wait, in terms of a 'discrete guy' who only deals with two objects in the universe, $\\-1$ and $\\+1$, this does not make any sense. There's no such object as $0$ in his universe. Nonetheless, this definition oftentimes makes sense. Why? Because we know that both $\\-1$ and $\\+1$ have a natural inclusion into $\\\\mathbb R^n$ where the mean value can be defined. Let us stop for a second and appreciate this fact \\- we allowed the 'mean' value of a distribution defined on the the set $\\\\mathcal S\\=\\\\{\\-1,\\+1\\\\}$ to take values on a different set $\\\\mathcal{S}' \\= \\[\\-1,1]$. (On the contrary, as of 03/2019, the canonical way of embedding heads and tails into $\\\\mathbb R^n$ is still not known, and, so, their mean value does not make much sense.)\n\nGeneralising this procedure to our example is straightforward:\n$$\n\\\\langle \\\\vec n \\\\rangle \\= \\\\int \\\\limits\\_{S^2} \\\\vec{n} f(\\\\vec n) ds\n$$\nWhich basically gives us a mean value of a distribution defined on $\\\\mathcal S'$ (again, by inclusion). An obvious downside \\- the averaged quantities have now no meaning for inhabitants of the $\\\\mathcal S$ manifold.\n\nIs any of these approaches dominant? Or maybe smth else? Is there a theory for general, more complicated manifolds?\nAny comments and /simple/ references are welcome.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The theoretical underpinnings of probability are simple \\- a probability distribution is simply a (nonnegative) measure defined on some $X$ such that the total measure of $X$ is $1$. That makes perfect sense on a manifold. There's no need for any special treatment.\n\nIf it's a smooth oriented $n$\\-manifold, we can use that smooth structure to define the density function for a \"continuous\" probability distribution \\- that density function is a nonnegative $n$\\-form with integral $1$. Compact Lie groups, and compact manifolds with a transitive Lie group action, even have a standard \"uniform\" distribution, invariant under that Lie group action.\n\nNow, you want to talk about expected values? We can set up those integrals $E(f)\\=\\\\int\\_{\\\\mathcal{M}} f(x)\\\\,d\\\\mu(x)$ with respect to the probability measure $\\\\mu$, but only as long as the function $f$ we're trying to find the expected value of takes values in $\\\\mathbb{R}$, or at least some normed vector space. The expected value is a weighted sum \\- we need to be able to add and take scalar multiples to make sense of it at all.  \n\nThat's the same normed vector space everywhere \\- something like a function from points on the manifold to vectors in the tangent space at those points isn't going to work (unless we embed everything into $\\\\mathbb{R}^m$, standardizing the tangent spaces as subspaces of that).\n\nSo then, the expected value of the position function doesn't make sense (usually). The manifold isn't a normed vector space, after all. It doesn't have an addition operation \\- why would we ever be able to add things up on it anyway?. On the other hand, with a particular embedding of the manifold into $\\\\mathbb{R}^m$, we can take an expected value of that. The uniform distribution on the sphere $S^2$, with the standard embedding into $\\\\mathbb{R}^3$ as $\\\\{(x,y,z): x^2\\+y^2\\+z^2\\=1\\\\}$, has an expected value of $(0,0,0\\)$.

When comparing what people write there online with the actual research articles of Einstein and Bell, it seems to me \\- put drastically \\- that people online talk about something but not about Bell and Einstein. Let me explain, what I mean. \n\nOnline most of the times the logical structure of the argument is roughly given in the following way (see, e.g., [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem) in the first few paragraphs): \n\nAssuming locality *and* pre\\-existing properties, Bell's inequalities follow. Quantum mechanics' predictions (and experiments) are in contradiction to the inequality. Hence, one can abandon *either* locality *or* pre\\-existing properties. \n\nReading the EPR paper (available [here](http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.47.777)) however, the structure seems to be quite different. They consider the following *criterion* of an element of the physical reality (and a criterion is not an assumption!): If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e. with probability equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity. This, I think, is very reasonable. One can even very well argue that this is an analytical statement because of the phrase 'without in any way disturbing a system'. So one does not have to *assume* the correctness of the criterion as it is true anyhow! \n\nIt is employed in the following situation (Bohm's version of the EPR set\\-up): \n\nThink of the singlet state of two spin\\-1/2 particles with total spin zero. If one measures the spin in the x direction of particle A, one can predict with certainty the spin in x direction of particle B, no matter how far the particles are separated (think of a space\\-like separation). For the sake of the argument it is not needed that we consider different directions for the two particles. \n\nNow assuming locality, they must conclude by their criterion that there really exist pre\\-existing properties. That is Einstein. \n\nSo, the correct reasoning should be (also in Bell's understanding as he pointed out repeatedly) that locality *implies* the pre\\-existing properties. The consequence of Bell's inequalities then is that one cannot abandon either locality or pre\\-existing properties but *must abandon locality*. \n\nSo, who's right? Why are there two different conclusions? Are Einstein and Bell missing an essential point? I often read that counterfactual definiteness is tacitly assumed. But that isn't an assumption right? It is simply a property of the singlet state if one measures the same spin direction for both particles which is sufficient here. \n\nIt would be very much appreciated if it could be pointed out in Einstein's and Bell's original papers where the mistakes or debatable passages are (if there are any), since I think they are a very good basis for this discussion. Thanks. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Have a look at [this table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics#Comparison_of_interpretations). Note that, in particular, true [counterfactual definiteness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfactual_definiteness) is rare among the interpretations.\n\nCounterfactual definiteness (which is what is usually called *realism* in the context of Bell's theorem) says that we can meaningfully talk about *every* result of *every* measurement, regardless of whether it is performed or not. That we can predict a *single* measurement with definiteness is not sufficient for counterfactual definiteness, it must be the case for *all*. Bell's derivation of his theorem assumes locality *and* that the probabilities to measure the particle at certain angles \"exist\", i.e. can be used in statistical calculations as if they are real, definite probabilities, and reality violates Bell's inequality, so at the very least it is either non\\-local or has no counterfactual definiteness. Note that \"no counterfactual definiteness\" does **not** prohibit that *some* things may be counterfactually determined.\n\nThe EPR argument shows then merely that it is not sufficient to give up CD to preserve locality \\- see again the table of interpretation and note that there are indeed interpretations which are neither local nor have CD. That the definiteness of *some* measurements can be achieved by entanglement even for spacelike separated measurements is as per the EPR argument the OP relates is the other hurdle a interpretation must take to call itself *local*. The Copenhagen interpretation throws its hands up and just says \"Fine, non\\-locality it is, then\" concerning this \"collapse\" of the wave\\-function, but Many Worlds and others (think they) find a way around.\n\n---\n\n\\[*Gets out the soapbox*]  \n\nAs I do not grow tired to remark, none of this has *any* physical implications. Whether the world is local, collapsing and non\\-CD or non\\-local, non\\-collapsing and CD has no bearing on the fact that *all* interpretations must predict the same things and are empirically indistingushable. You may like one better than the others, but they are nothing more than soothing balm for our minds that feel incapable of dealing with the unadorned quantum world. *\"Shut up and calculate\"* remains the mantra of the working physicist."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the explanation provided, which of the following statements is true regarding Bell's theorem and the EPR argument?\n\nA) Bell's theorem proves that quantum mechanics must abandon either locality or pre-existing properties, but not necessarily both.\n\nB) The EPR argument demonstrates that locality implies pre-existing properties, and Bell's theorem consequently shows that locality must be abandoned.\n\nC) Counterfactual definiteness is an essential assumption in both Bell's theorem and the EPR argument.\n\nD) The EPR criterion of physical reality is a debatable assumption rather than an analytical statement.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA is incorrect because it reflects the common online interpretation, which the passage argues is not accurate. \nB is correct as it aligns with the explanation given in the passage about Einstein's and Bell's original arguments.\nC is incorrect because the passage states that counterfactual definiteness is not necessarily assumed, and is a property of the singlet state in certain measurements.\nD is incorrect because the passage argues that the EPR criterion can be considered an analytical statement due to the phrase \"without in any way disturbing a system.\"\n\nThe correct answer B reflects the key points made in the passage about the logical structure of the EPR argument and Bell's theorem, emphasizing that locality implies pre-existing properties, and therefore Bell's theorem necessitates abandoning locality."}, "43": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/06/14", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/179055", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/34621/"], "docs_id": 179055, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm building out an admin ui with the built in components, and i have an `actionsColumn` that i'm using.

Because it first renders what's saved in `ui_bookmark`.  \n\nClear the contents of that table `where user_id = {your admin id}`.  \n\nIf you are on a dev env, just delete everything from that table. \n\nHonestly, I wouldn't be surprised if this fixes your column width problem also."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When working with Magento 2 admin UI grids using UI components, you notice that changes to column widths and sort order in your XML configuration are not taking effect. What is the most likely cause and solution for this issue?\n\nA) The browser cache is storing old grid layouts. Clear the browser cache and reload the page.\n\nB) The 'resizeEnabled' parameter needs to be set to false in the XML configuration for the column.\n\nC) The grid settings are being overridden by data stored in the ui_bookmark database table. Clear the relevant entries from this table.\n\nD) The actionsColumn component ignores custom width and sort order settings by design. Use a different column type instead.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In Magento 2, grid settings for UI components are stored in the ui_bookmark database table. Even if you don't manually change anything in the grid, simply viewing it creates a record in this table. When rendering the grid, Magento merges these stored settings with the XML configuration, giving priority to the stored settings. This is why changes to column widths (resizeDefaultWidth) and sort order in the XML may not appear to take effect.\n\nTo resolve this, you need to clear the relevant entries from the ui_bookmark table, typically those associated with your admin user ID. In a development environment, it's often safe to clear all entries from this table. After clearing these entries, your XML configuration changes should take effect when you next view the grid.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while clearing browser cache can sometimes help with UI issues, it wouldn't address server-side data storage.\n\nOption B is a misunderstanding of the 'resizeEnabled' parameter, which doesn't directly affect how the initial width is applied.\n\nOption D is incorrect because actionsColumn can accept custom settings, even if they're sometimes overridden by other factors like the ui_bookmark data."}, "44": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/06/19", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/770730", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/267273/"], "docs_id": 770730, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm currently looking up compiling a custom kernel and I find various guides that first say `make modules` and then `make modules_install` in the step when you compile and install the modules while other just do `make modules_install`.\n\nCould someone enlighten me and explain the difference (I would prefer them explained in newbie language: nothing too detailed, thanks).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The `make modules` command will just compile the modules, leaving the compiled binaries in the build directory. `make modules_install` will make sure that there are compiled binaries (and compile the modules, if not) and install the binaries into your kernel's `modules` directory.\n\nIf you are sure that all modules compile without problems, you can use `make modules_install` directly."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When compiling a custom kernel, what is the primary difference between using `make modules` followed by `make modules_install` versus using only `make modules_install`?\n\nA) `make modules` compiles the modules, while `make modules_install` only installs pre-compiled modules.\nB) `make modules_install` compiles and installs modules, while `make modules` only compiles them.\nC) Using both commands ensures all modules are compiled before installation, while using only `make modules_install` may skip compilation of some modules.\nD) `make modules` installs the modules, while `make modules_install` compiles them.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \n`make modules` compiles the kernel modules and leaves the compiled binaries in the build directory.

As a result, the base space B is homeomorphic to S^2 but is not a smooth affine manifold. Instead, it's a singular affine manifold. The affine structure exists on B-\u0394, where \u0394 consists of 24 points corresponding to the singular fibers. The affine structure does not extend to these 24 points, so the Legendre transform can only be applied on B-\u0394, not on the entire B.

So when you remove all children, you are left with an empty `<Set/>` node. You need to be able to remove that specific node as well.\n\nTo adapt your existing method, you need to do something like:\n\n```\nforeach (XmlNode chkNode in nodes)\n{                \n    string currentName = \"Test 1\";\n    if (!nameDict.ContainsKey(currentName))\n    {\n        XmlNode parent = chkNode.ParentNode;\n        parent.ParentNode.RemoveChild(parent);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nOf course, I can't test this as\\-is since I am not sure what exactly `nameDict` and `nodes` are.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, this code will break if `chkNode` or `chkNode.ParentNode` are `XmlNodes` that cannot have parents (such as a Attribute, Document, DocumentFragment, Entity, Notation nodes). If you think this is a possible scenario, you might want to include the appropriate null checks or wrap this method in a `try-catch`\n\nSomething like:\n\n```\nXmlNode parent = chkNode.ParentNode;\nif (parent != null && parent.ParentNode != null)\n    parent.ParentNode.RemoveChild(parent);\n\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\ntry\n{\n    XmlNode parent = chkNode.ParentNode;\n    parent.ParentNode.RemoveChild(parent);\n}\ncatch (NullReferenceException ex)\n{\n    // do something with exception\n}\n\n```\n\nThere are several options with LINQ to accomplish what you want in a better way, but since you are using C\\#2\\.0, this solution should get you in the right direction."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When modifying an XML document to remove specific nodes based on a condition, which of the following code snippets will correctly remove both the target node and its parent <Set> element?\n\nA) \n```csharp\nforeach (XmlNode chkNode in nodes)\n{                \n    if (!nameDict.ContainsKey(currentName))                                    \n        chkNode.RemoveAll();\n}\n```\n\nB) \n```csharp\nforeach (XmlNode chkNode in nodes)\n{                \n    if (!nameDict.ContainsKey(currentName))                                    \n        chkNode.ParentNode.RemoveAll();\n}\n```\n\nC) \n```csharp\nforeach (XmlNode chkNode in nodes)\n{                \n    if (!nameDict.ContainsKey(currentName))\n    {\n        XmlNode parent = chkNode.ParentNode;\n        parent.ParentNode.RemoveChild(parent);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nD) \n```csharp\nforeach (XmlNode chkNode in nodes)\n{                \n    if (!nameDict.ContainsKey(currentName))\n    {\n        chkNode.ParentNode.RemoveChild(chkNode);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it removes both the target node and its parent <Set> element.

-jar /usr/share/jenkins/jenkins.war` but with `service jenkins start|stop`.\n\nWhen you manually start, it'll change owner to user which started `jenkins.war` via `java`, service runs under user:group `jenkins:jenkins`.\n\nDefault path for service Jenkins (Debian/Ubuntu) should be `/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/<ProjectName>/workspace` and everything inside `/var/lib/jenkins/` must be owned by user `jenkins` and group `jenkins`:\n\n```sh\nchown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/\n\n```\n\nAlso check if you have a properly installed and configured JDK inside your Jenkins project."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Jenkins build is failing with a java.nio.file.AccessDeniedException error for a Maven-related file. Which of the following is the most likely cause and solution for this issue?\n\nA) The Maven installation is corrupted. Reinstall Maven on the Jenkins server.\n\nB) The Jenkins service is running under the wrong user account. Ensure Jenkins is started as a service under the jenkins user.\n\nC) The JDK is not properly configured in the Jenkins project. Review and update the JDK settings in the project configuration.\n\nD) The workspace directory permissions are incorrect. Change the owner of /var/lib/jenkins/ recursively to root:root.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The error suggests a permissions issue. The most likely cause is that Jenkins is being run manually instead of as a service, which can lead to incorrect file ownership and permissions. Running Jenkins as a service ensures it operates under the jenkins user account, which should have the necessary permissions to access and modify files in the Jenkins workspace. The solution involves ensuring Jenkins is started using the command `service jenkins start` rather than running it manually, and verifying that the /var/lib/jenkins/ directory and its contents are owned by the jenkins user and group. This can be accomplished with the command `chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/`."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/02/17", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/11311", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/3316/"], "docs_id": 11311, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have two documents A and B.

The answer is *because the text height is not a multiple of line height*.\n\nThis is usually ignored for TeX documents because paragraphs are short or there is other stretchable glue made by displayed equations or lists so there isn't a *line grid* on the page anyway.\n\nIn your concrete example, the annoying space vanishes if you force text height to be a multiple of line height, for instance\n\n```\n\\usepackage{calc}\n\n\\usepackage[paper=a4paper,twoside=true,lmargin=4cm,\nrmargin=4cm,bindingoffset=0cm,textheight=45\\baselineskip+\\topskip]{geometry}\n\n```\n\nAdding `\\topskip` is neccessary because the first line doesn't occupy a full `\\baselineskip`.\n\n![example image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jaDu3.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In LaTeX document layout, what can cause uneven spacing between paragraphs and misaligned page bottoms, and how can it be resolved?\n\nA) The use of the book document class always causes this issue, and it can be fixed by switching to the article class.\n\nB) This occurs when the text height is not a multiple of line height, and can be resolved by adjusting the geometry package settings to make text height a multiple of \\baselineskip plus \\topskip.\n\nC) Uneven paragraph spacing is caused by using twoside=true in the geometry package, and can be fixed by setting it to false.\n\nD) This problem is inherent in LaTeX and cannot be resolved without manually adjusting spacing on each page.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The issue arises when the text height is not a multiple of the line height, causing LaTeX to stretch the parskip (paragraph skip) to adjust the page foot. This can result in uneven spacing between paragraphs and misaligned page bottoms. The problem can be resolved by adjusting the geometry package settings to ensure the text height is a multiple of the line height. Specifically, setting the text height to a multiple of \\baselineskip plus \\topskip (e.g., textheight=45\\baselineskip+\\topskip) forces the text height to align with the line grid, eliminating the uneven spacing.
