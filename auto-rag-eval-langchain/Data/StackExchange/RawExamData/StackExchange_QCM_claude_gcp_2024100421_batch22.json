Since then at leave 5 of them have died.\n\nNone of the bulbs are on dimmer switches. However, my house is more than 100 years old. Could old wiring decrease the life of LEDs? All of my circuits are on modern breakers, and none of the wiring that I can see is knob\\-and\\-tube, but it's possible there is some of that left behind the walls.\n\nAnother theory as to why the LEDs die early is that most of the lights, and many of the outlets, in my house are on a single circuit (there are lots of other circuits, but for whatever reason they put most of the lights on just one circuit), and so that circuit can sometimes be under heavy load.

A 16w led lamp today will produce as much light as a 100w bulb so you would need many more led bulbs to over heat an incadesent fixture.

I have had a couple of failures with DLC listed lamps and 1 fixture but they were replaced with no hassle. I get most of my fixtures and retrofit lamps from led my place on line and 1000 bulbs they have good prices but you need to verify DLC listing if you want long life.

While I can't really speak about the actual business problem, I can give a few reasons for why we think that Event Sourcing might be a good fit:\n\n* great auditing capabilities based on the history of events\n* \"travelling back in time\" to recreate a previous state of an aggregate (e.g. for debugging purposes)\n* the ability to create new projections that take the full history into account\n\nSince I can't go into detail about the exact domain we're in, I will describe my problem using the domain described [in this Kata dealing with quiz games](https://playingwithprojections.github.io/doc/domain/).\n\nI think I got the general idea of Event Sourcing and how CQRS links to it. However, all examples I can find use domains with clear separations between aggregates as well as between different instances of the same aggregate (in the Kata mentioned above, quizzes and games have a clear relationship. There's no interdependence between different quizzes or different games).\n\nThe problem\n-----------\n\nIn my case I have the problem that it must be possible to **merge different instances of the same aggregate** (in our sample domain this could mean that it must be possible to merge different quizzes together into one quiz) as well as undoing this merge later on (reconstructing the two original quizzes from the merged one).\n\nThis constraint adds quite some complexity when it comes to constructing the current state of an aggregate, because it's necessary to read the whole event stream from the beginning to be sure that all relevant events are taken into consideration. It's not possible to partition the event stream in a useful way because it's impossible to tell which aggregates will be merged later in the future. It might even be a problem when the event stream gets partitioned, because the temporal order of related events gets lost.  \n\nFrom what I understand, partitioning the event stream allows for a fast provision of the events that are necessary to build up the current state of an aggregate. For instance, if I want to know the current state of the quiz with ID `124ecf`, I technically could filter the event streams to just have the events for this exact ID which would drastically reduce the number of events. If this is not possible, like in my case, reading the event stream ad hoc to recreate the state of an aggregate will become very slow and impractical over time.\n\nThe solution I came up with so far\n----------------------------------\n\nThe only solution for this problem that seems to be possible to me is to work with rolling snapshots for all necessary projections. The snapshots would update themselves continuously, building up a state optimized for their specific use case (processing commands, answering queries etc.).  \n\nI'm skeptical about this idea, because it requires quite some effort. Most of the implementations of typical applications don't require rolling snapshots for most use cases because building up the desired state from the event stream is fast enough. This simplicity is lost in my case.\n\nThe question\n------------\n\nMy question could be split up in several parts:\n\n* Is it a good idea to use Event Sourcing for domains like these where it's not possible to draw clear boundaries between different instances of the same aggregate?\n* Does it make sense to heavily rely on using rolling snapshots to get the desired performance?\n* Is there another way other than rolling snapshots to implement this?\n* I can't think of a way for partitioning the event stream. Am I missing something? Are there some techniques that allow partitioning/sharding under the given circumstances?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your analogy is intereseting and heading in the right direction. \n\n> Microservices are like user space drivers\n\nYes and no: \n\n* Yes, like [user\\-mode drivers](https://wiki.minix3.org/doku.php?id=developersguide:overviewofminixarchitecture), microservices provide an independent functionality in their own tiny and independent process. Minix drivers run as independent process to offer a functionality that would otherwise be (or at least run as a) part of a monolotithic kernel.\n* No, because user\\-mode drivers are archtiectured around the microkernel. Remove the microkernel and the full architecture is useless. The microservice archtiecture, is not a star around a central component, but a mesh. Every microservice has its value by its own. Shutting down any of them should still leave an overall system that provides some (less) value.\n* No, because microservices can be used to scale, so that you run several instances on different machines of the same service. I doubt that you would run in parrallel 2 keyboard drivers to increase throughput.\n\n> Microservices adds communication overhead\n\nYes, and it's a lot of message passing like on the Minix kernel. The API of microservices might however be of a higher level of abstraction, thius more complex, and based on more complex types. The communication overhead will be more significant than what you are used to for an OS microkernel with its device drivers. (*and the [overhead for switching between user\\-mode and kernel\\-mode](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/3/198874-lessons-learned-from-30-years-of-minix/fulltext), which was one of the performance reason why MINIX didn't become mainstream, can be neglected in comparison*). \n\n> Microservices can be partially upgraded without downtime  \n> \n>  Microservices does not need to speak HTTP.\n\nYes, exactly"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between microservices and user-mode drivers in operating systems?\n\nA) Microservices and user-mode drivers are identical in all aspects of their architecture and implementation.\n\nB) Microservices and user-mode drivers both run as independent processes, but microservices form a mesh architecture while user-mode drivers rely on a central microkernel.\n\nC) Microservices and user-mode drivers both use HTTP for communication and can be partially upgraded without downtime.\n\nD) Microservices and user-mode drivers both require a central component to function and cannot operate independently.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is correct because it accurately captures the key similarities and differences between microservices and user-mode drivers. Both run as independent processes, which is a similarity. However, the architecture differs significantly: microservices form a mesh where each service has individual value and can operate independently, while user-mode drivers are structured around a central microkernel and cannot function without it. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while there are some similarities, microservices and user-mode drivers are not identical in all aspects. \n\nOption C is incorrect because while microservices can be partially upgraded without downtime, they do not necessarily use HTTP for communication. Additionally, this statement doesn't apply to user-mode drivers.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it contradicts the nature of microservices, which do not require a central component and can operate independently.

In short, the premise behind TDD is that code should be\n>  continually tested and refactored.\n\n**Practical TDD**\n\nFormal automated Testing, especially Unit Testing every method of every class is just as bad an anti\\-pattern and not testing anything. There is a balance to be had. Are you writing unit tests for every `setXXX/getXXX` method, they are methods as well!\n\nAlso Tests can help save time and money, but don't forget that they cost time and money to develop and they are code, so they cost time and money to maintain. If they atrophy from lack of maintenance then they become a liability more than a benefit.\n\nLike everything like this, there is a **balance** which can't be defined by anyone but yourself. Any dogma either way is probably more wrong that correct.\n\nA good metric is code that is critical to the business logic and subject to frequent modification based on changing requirements. Those things needs formal tests that are automated, that would be a big return on investment.\n\nYou are going to be very hard pressed to find many professional shops that work this way either. It just doesn't make business sense to spend money testing things that will for all practical purposes never change after a simple smoke test is preformed. Writing formal automated unit tests for `.getXXX/.setXXX` methods is a prime example of this, complete waste of time.\n\n> It is now two decades since it was pointed out that program testing\n>  may convincingly demonstrate the presence of bugs, but can never\n>  demonstrate their absence.

So I can only give you a list of the benefits provided by the DLCs here and you have to be honest with yourself to not \"use\" them, e.g. always consider yourself to be 200k poorer than you are:\n\n* I'll skip the cars, clothes and weapons, since they shouldn't be difficult to notice \\- basically you don't own anything but a motorbike and your own clothes in the beginning\n* [Police Protection Pack](http://store.steampowered.com/app/215249): Apart from the SWAT stuff it adds the \"High Speed\" mission and gives you some police XP (not enough for a full point on its own though)\n* [The High Roller Pack](http://store.steampowered.com/app/215244): $200k and premature access to the Tuono vehicle and High Roller outfit\n* [Martial Arts Pack](http://store.steampowered.com/app/202191/) gives you slight Triad XP boost (again not enough for a point on its own, but still...)\n* [The Red Envelope Pack](http://store.steampowered.com/app/215243): those red envelopes scattered around town containing $50k each\n* [Top Dog Gold Pack](http://store.steampowered.com/app/215242) / [Top Dog Silver Pack](http://store.steampowered.com/app/215241): A total of both 8 police and triad skill points\n* [The Zodiac Tournament](http://store.steampowered.com/app/215258): That tournament\n\nSo in summary, if you don't want to use the too severe DLC bonuses, don't collect the red envelopes and always leave $200k and 8 triad/police skill point unused...\n\n---\n\nIf you're on PC (or can somehow access the respective files on your console), you can remove/rename the respective files (and probably have to deactivate updates for the game) I found a list of the DLCs' respective filenames [here](http://steamcommunity.com/app/202170/discussions/0/846945955286761354/), extended by me on how cheat\\-y they are:\n\n> 1E6323E1\\.dat Top Dog Gold Pack \\# pure cheat  \n> \n>  576E446C.dat Top Dog Silver Pack \\# pure cheat  \n> \n>  AC8D6F78\\.dat High Roller Pack \\# pure cheat  \n> \n>  E58008F5\\.dat Red Envelope Pack \\# cheat, but you have to search them  \n> \n>  E80C9CFE.dat police protection pack \\# swat clothes/vehicles, high speed mission (farm police XP)  \n> \n>  3E97A062\\.dat Tactical Soldier Pack \\# clothes \\& weapons  \n> \n>  8C79ECFB.dat Retro Triad Pack \\# clothes  \n> \n>  67EE992C.dat Martial Arts Pack \\# clothes, dummy, shaolin showdown mission (farm triad XP)  \n> \n>  81F578F0\\.dat Dragon Master Pack \\# collection of other DLC  \n> \n>  613E5E9C.dat Square Enix Character Pack \\# clothes  \n> \n>  849D8C70\\.dat Street Racer Pack \\# additional races  \n> \n>  B41D5130\\.dat Community Gift Pack \\# ???  \n> \n>  BA29F60B.dat Ghost Pig Pack \\# clothes  \n> \n>  CD90EBFD.dat Screen Legends Pack \\# clothes, sword  \n> \n>  D500D5B5\\.dat Deep Undercover Pack \\# clothes, car, CB radio  \n> \n>  F3249186\\.dat Gangland Style Pack \\# tattoos  \n> \n>  FD1036BD.dat Valve T\\-Shirt Pack \\# clothes  \n> \n>  779AC7EF.dat SWAT Pack \\# cop mission (clothes?)  \n> \n>  5AE2D067\\.dat Drunken Fist Pack \\# clothes  \n> \n>  9ADD7588\\.dat Monkey King Pack \\# clothes, cloud\\-bike  \n> \n>  41CADD1F.dat Law Enforcer Pack \\# HKPD clothes \\& cars  \n> \n>  28333911\\.dat Movie Masters Pack \\# clothes  \n> \n>  C8F81F7D.dat Triad Enforcer Pack \\# clothes, car  \n> \n>  7A1653E4\\.dat gsp pack \\# clothes\n> \n> \n> Story DLC:  \n> \n>  D3D01205\\.dat Wheels of Fury \\# mission for/with powerful car  \n> \n>  E0E8FC75\\.dat Zodiac Tournament Pack  \n> \n>  13EFB7EA.dat Nightmare in North Point \\# separate from main game  \n> \n>  ????????.dat Year of the Snake \\# separate from main game"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Sleeping Dogs GOTY edition, which of the following DLC packs provides the player with both a significant amount of in-game currency and early access to a vehicle, potentially disrupting the game's progression balance?\n\nA) Police Protection Pack\nB) The High Roller Pack\nC) Martial Arts Pack\nD) The Red Envelope Pack\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The High Roller Pack gives players $200,000 in-game currency and premature access to the Tuono vehicle, which can significantly alter the early game experience.

Will reading from 2 disks be faster than 1? And the obvious answer is yes. If one disk is only capable of reading 100MBps, two disks naturally can read at 200MBps. And that's why the theoretical read speed of raid 0 is n, where n is the number of disks in the array. The same goes for raid 1 with reads. There are n number of disks and you can read from all of them at the same time for greater speed.\n\nHowever, raid 0 is faster than raid 1 because there's not only reads but also writes. Raid 0 is striped, so only half the data is in one disk and the other half on the other disk. Raid 1 is cloned, so the data is on both sides. This means that when you write, you need to write to both disks of all the data in raid 1\\. So, the write speed in raid 0 is again n, here n is the number of disks in the array versus raid 1, where the write speed is always 1; same as writing to non\\-raid disk.\n\nAlso touching on the original question's misconception. You don't scan the disk to find the file's data, ever. Files have pointers which point to a block in the drive of where that file is stored in. Once you have the file in question, you fetch the data from that position and retrieve the relevant information from that block.\n\nI suggest you read more about it in [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID) about RAID.\n\nAlso, you can try playing around with raid calculator to see theoretical read/write speeds in [wolfram alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=raid)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided RAID information:\n\nQuestion: A company is considering implementing RAID for their storage system. They want to maximize both read and write speeds. Based on the information provided, which RAID level would best meet their requirements, and why?\n\nA) RAID 1, because it provides the fastest read speeds by reading from multiple disks simultaneously\nB) RAID 0, because it offers the best balance of improved read and write speeds\nC) A single non-RAID disk, because it avoids the complexity of RAID systems\nD) RAID 5, because it offers a good balance of speed and redundancy\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: RAID 0 is the best choice for maximizing both read and write speeds. The information provided states that RAID 0 offers theoretical read and write speeds of n times a single disk's speed, where n is the number of disks in the array. While RAID 1 can match RAID 0's read speeds, its write speed is limited to that of a single disk because data must be written to all disks in the array. RAID 0 achieves this performance by striping data across multiple disks, allowing parallel read and write operations.

Is there really much of a difference apart from Kronecker's methods being more constructive?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can find a nice description of Kronecker's approach in an article by Harley Flanders,\n\"The Meaning of the Form Calculus in Classical Ideal Theory\" (Trans. AMS 95 (1960\\), 92\\-\\-100\\). It is at JSTOR [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1993332?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). I found that more to my tastes than Edwards' book.\n\nThere is a difference between the two approaches. Kronecker was thinking in very general terms, beyond the \"one\\-dimensional\" setting that Dedekind worked in. (Kronecker had a dream \\-\\- a second one I suppose \\-\\- of unifying number theory and algebraic geometry but the tools to achieve this would take a couple more generations to appear). That accounts in part for Kronecker's multivariable polynomials. He had bigger goals than just unique factorization in rings of integers.\n\nHere is one example of the difference between Kronecker and Dedekind. Suppose ${\\\\mathfrak a}$ is an ideal in the ring of integers of a number field $K$ and I ask you to compute its norm, i.e., the size of ${\\\\cal O}\\_K/\\\\mathfrak a$. How would you do it? From Dedekind's point of view, you find a ${\\\\mathbf Z}$\\-basis of ${\\\\cal O}\\_K$ and of ${\\\\mathfrak a}$, write the basis of the ideal in terms of the basis of the ring of integers, and then compute (the absolute value of) the determinant of the matrix expressing the ideal basis in terms of the ring basis. But as you may know, ideals usually are *not* given to us in terms of a ${\\\\mathbf Z}$\\-basis. More often they are given in terms of just two generators, say ${\\\\mathfrak a} \\= (\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)$. How can you compute the norm of the ideal in terms of the two generators? In principle it should be possible, since the two generators determine the ideal they generate, so all the data you need is encoded in the numbers $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\beta$.\n\nThere is a Dedekind\\-style way to write the norm of ${\\\\mathfrak a}$ in terms of the two generators: the norm of an ideal is the gcd of the norms of *all* elements of the ideal.\nWatch out: you can't get by using only the gcd of the norms of the two generators.\nFor example, in the Gaussian integers the ideal $(1\\+2i,1\\-2i)$ is the unit ideal $(1\\)$, so it has norm 1, but the two generators $1\\+2i$ and $1\\-2i$ have norm 5, whose gcd is not 1\\. (Of course the ideal also contains $1\\+2i \\- (1\\-2i) \\= 4i$, whose norm is 4, and the gcd of that with 5 is one and you're done.) In principle you only need to form the gcd of the norms of a finite number of elements in the ideal, but it's not clear which \"finitely many\" elements are practically enough. So I think it's fair to say Dedekind's point of view does not easily allow you to find the norm of an ideal in terms of two generators of the ideal, which is how one usually thinks about them concretely.\n\nNow here is how Kronecker would find the norm of the ideal (essentially). Form the polynomial $\\\\alpha \\+ \\\\beta{T}$ in ${\\\\cal O}\\_K\\[T]$. The field extension $K(T)/{\\\\mathbf Q}(T)$ is finite.\nTake the field norm of $\\\\alpha \\+ \\\\beta{T}$ down to ${\\\\mathbf Q}(T)$. The result is in ${\\\\mathbf Z}\\[T]$.\nThat integral polynomial has finitely many coefficients (which are *not* all norms of elements in $K$, so this isn't some disguised version of the previous paragraph). The gcd of the integral coefficients of ${\\\\rm N}\\_{K(T)/{\\\\mathbf Q}(T)}(\\\\alpha \\+ \\\\beta{T})$ is the norm of the ideal. And if the ideal is given to you with more than two generators, just let $f(T)$ be the polynomial with higher degree having those generators as its coefficients, one for each power of $T$ (it doesn't matter what order you use the generators as coefficients) and do the same thing as in the case of two generators: field norm down to ${\\\\mathbf Q}(T)$ and then gcd of the integral coefficients that pop out. I personally was blown away when I saw this method work, since practically no books on algebraic number theory discuss Kronecker's point of view, so this particular result isn't there. (To be honest, you do *not* need Kronecker's multivariable polynomial method to prove this norm formula. Once you know the formula, it can be derived by more orthodox techniques, but of course it leaves out the question of how anyone would have ever discovered this formula in the first place by orthodox methods. Any suggestions?)\n\nIn a sense this example is only a \"constructive\" dichotomy between Kronecker and Dedekind, but I think it still addresses the question that is asked, because each method of solving this problem (Dedekind's ${\\\\mathbf Z}$\\-bases and Kronecker's polynomials) is constructive but they feel so different from each other."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of computing the norm of an ideal in algebraic number theory, which of the following statements best describes the difference between Kronecker's approach and Dedekind's approach?\n\nA) Dedekind's method is more efficient for ideals given with two generators, while Kronecker's method works better for ideals with a Z-basis.\n\nB) Kronecker's approach involves using multivariable polynomials and field norms, while Dedekind's approach relies on Z-bases and determinants.\n\nC) Dedekind's method is purely theoretical, while Kronecker's method is entirely constructive.\n\nD) Kronecker's approach is limited to one-dimensional settings, whereas Dedekind's approach can handle more general cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The key difference between Kronecker's and Dedekind's approaches lies in their methodologies. Dedekind's approach typically involves finding a Z-basis for the ring of integers and the ideal, then computing the determinant of the matrix expressing the ideal basis in terms of the ring basis. In contrast, Kronecker's method utilizes multivariable polynomials and field norms. For an ideal generated by \u03b1 and \u03b2, Kronecker would form the polynomial \u03b1 + \u03b2T, take its field norm to Q(T), and then find the gcd of the resulting polynomial's coefficients. This approach is more adaptable to ideals given by generators, which is often the case in practice. Options A and D are incorrect as they mischaracterize the strengths and limitations of each approach.

The project CRS does not need to be EPSG:4326 (eliminating B), as on-the-fly reprojection can be enabled. The OpenLayers plugin requires the project CRS to be EPSG:3857, but individual layers can have different CRSs, which matches statement C.

Bitorrent is a file transfer protocol, and utp was a lower level protocol that was developed by the writers of utorrent for more efficient transfers. They were bought over by Bittorrent Inc who maintain and the \"Mainline\" reference torrent client (aka the bittorrent client) and the torrent specifications. They also use the protocol for things like bitorrent sync.\n\nTorrents are decentralised by nature \\- no one 'provides' it. A torrent file or magnet link basically tells you \"This file consists of these chunks. If you ask at tracker X Y and Z, it will point you at people who have these chunks\". A magnet link is basically a link that provides this information without the need to download a file, but essentially there's no difference.\n\nA tracker is a directory of 'peers' who are downloading a file, and seeds who have downloaded and are sharing the file. If you have no tracker, peers and seeds can communicate directly over DHT to find each other. \n\nAs for clients, there are many, and anyone can create a torrent, add it to a tracker and share a file. If Bittorrent Inc disappeared tomorrow, the torrents will still flow."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the nature of the BitTorrent protocol and its infrastructure?\n\nA) BitTorrent is a centralized file-sharing service provided by BitTorrent Inc., with all torrents managed through their servers.\n\nB) BitTorrent is a decentralized protocol that relies on trackers to function, and would cease to work if BitTorrent Inc. disappeared.\n\nC) BitTorrent is a decentralized protocol that can function without central servers, using trackers or DHT for peer discovery, and can continue to operate independently of any single company.\n\nD) BitTorrent is primarily a software application developed by BitTorrent Inc., and other clients are unofficial derivatives.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because BitTorrent is indeed a decentralized protocol that doesn't rely on any single company or central server to function. It uses trackers or Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for peer discovery, allowing users to find and share files without a central authority. Even if BitTorrent Inc. were to disappear, the protocol would continue to function as long as there are clients and users implementing it. This decentralized nature is a key feature of the BitTorrent protocol, distinguishing it from centralized file-sharing services and ensuring its resilience."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/04/13", "source": ["https://ell.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5452", "https://ell.meta.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.meta.stackexchange.com/users/30405/"], "docs_id": 5452, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am looking for resources for advanced spoken English, where less common vocabulary and grammar are used.

(yuck!)\n\nAny decent idea?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The basic idea is that you **do NOT check\\-in confidential values** in the code or in the compiled binary. Especially if the project is open source you really shouldn't. There are several configuration strategies you can take in order to do so:\n\nPlaceholders in code (hardcoded values)\n---------------------------------------\n\n**Placeholders in code** \\- as was suggested \\- which is most sane and easiest to do in dynamic programming languages as the code is easy to change (without needing to compile). I've seen a lot of open source projects do this such as MediaWiki with it's [`LocalSettings.php`](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual%3aLocalSettings.php).\n\nThe **downside with this strategy** is that the key is hardcoded. So if the program is distributed as a binary then having the key hard\\-coded does not make it particularly maintainable.\n\nConfiguration Text Files\n------------------------\n\nYou can also do this by implementing **configuration text files**, i.e. the program/application searches for a configuration file and reads values from it. You can check\\-in a sample configuration with placeholders but have the actual configuration local in your machine. \n\nIn your case you can create a `key.conf` text file with the actual key, let the program use that file and let it be ignored by version control. You can, for being helpful, check in a `key.conf.example` text file with a bogus key and check that\\-in. Make sure your program/application makes an helpful error message \nfor the user to add the actual key in the correct file.\n\nSome programming languages have APIs that provide this automatically for you, such as:\n\n* Java's [Properties API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html), [Preferences API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/lang/preferences.html), [Apache Commons Configuration API](http://commons.apache.org/configuration/)\n* C\\#/VB.NET apps does this with `App.Config` files accessible through the [ConfigurationManager .NET API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.configuration.configurationmanager.aspx)\n* NodeJS apps have a convention of `package.json` or putting configuration values in json\\-files, and with the [file modules API](http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_file_modules) the files are easy to parse and use as they're basically [JavaScript object literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects).\n\nIf your application is a database app, then consider putting the key or other configuration variables in the database. It is the same as the configuration text file above but you put all configuration variables such as the key in a database table instead.\n\nThrough preferences view or a Back Office app\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf the program is a window or a web application with views then you can also let the application create the configuration file, through a preferences view of sorts. That way you don't need to check in an example config file as suggested above.\n\nMediaWiki solved this similarly by auto\\-generating the `LocalSettings.php` file in an initial installation process.\n\nAdmittedly this is not an option for programs that solely run as background processes, services or daemons. However that's why you create seperate GUI projects for these to create a point\\-of\\-entry for administration and preferences settings, in web apps usually called a *[Back Office application](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_office_application)*."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is working on an open-source project that requires the use of a secret API key.

If we apply a potetntial across the wire, what happens? Of course, we say there is a current, and the electrons \"flow\". But what does that really mean?\n\nSuppose when the electrons \"flow\", each copper atom gives its electron to the next atom in the line. From a QM perspective, nothing has changed!

In quantum mechanics, electron flow in a conductor is not simply a matter of electrons physically moving from one atom to another. Instead, it's represented by a change in the wavefunction of the electrons.

This doubles the usefulness of each pound of copper (aluminium etc) Over long distances, this is a significant cost saving.\n\n2\\) Three phase motors run smoothly with no additional complexity to define their running direction. Power delivery is approximately constant as the rotor follows the rotating field (with some slip, in an induction motor) with no torque variation or vibration. Reversing can be as simple as interchanging any two phases.\n\nThe advantage of smoothness also applies to the 3 phase generators : they absorb power from e.g. the turbine smoothly : a large single phase generator would probably be shaken apart from the torque variations."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the advantages of three-phase power systems over single-phase systems?\n\nA) Three-phase systems require less copper for the same power transmission, but are more complex to reverse motor direction.\n\nB) Three-phase systems provide smoother power delivery in motors and generators, but use more conductors than single-phase systems.\n\nC) Three-phase systems deliver 3 times the power with 1.5 times the conductors, and provide smoother operation in both motors and generators.\n\nD) Three-phase systems always maintain non-zero voltage, making them ideal for high-voltage applications, but they are less efficient in copper usage.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it accurately captures two main advantages of three-phase systems as described in the documentation.

Normally the points are dynamic: that is, they are not given beforehand. (If they are available in advance, or in very large groups, some optimizations based on sorting them will be available.) Let *Q* be the number of query points and *P* be the number of polygon *vertices.*\n\n### Vector polygon data\n\n(1\\) **Few points, few polygon vertices *in toto***. Use a brute\\-force procedure, such as the classic [line\\-stabbing algorithm](http://lin-ear-th-inking.blogspot.com/2007/07/ultimate-point-in-polygon.html). For any decent method, the cost is O(P\\*Q), because it costs O(1\\) time to compare a point to a polygon edge and all such comparisons have to be made.\n\n(2\\) **Possibly many polygon vertices, but they are dynamic:** each time a point is used in the query, the polygons might all have changed. Again use a brute\\-force algorithm. The cost is still O(P\\*Q), which will be large because *P* will be large, but there's no helping that. If the changes are small or controlled (*e.g.*, the polygons are slightly changing shape or simply moving around slowly) you might be able to use a version of the next solution and find an efficient way to update the data structures as the polygons change. That would likely be a matter for original research.\n\n(3\\) **Many polygon vertices and static polygons** (that is, the polygon layer will rarely change). Precompute a data structure to support the search (which could be based on a [line sweep](http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=tutorials&d2=lineSweep) or a [quadtree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) algorithm). The cost of precomputation for these algorithms is O(P\\*log(P)), but the cost of the queries becomes O(Q\\*log(P)), so the total cost is O((P\\+Q)\\*log(P)).\n\nSome improvements are available in **special cases**, such as \n\n(a) **All polygons are convex** ([preprocessing the polygons can be done more quickly](http://erich.realtimerendering.com/ptinpoly/)), \n\n(b) **All polygon interiors are disjoint**, in which case you can think of their union as being a single polygon (which allows for straightforward efficient algorithms, such as those based on triangulation, and \n\n(c) **Most polygons are not very tortuous**\\-\\-that is, they occupy large portions of their bounding boxes\\-\\-in which case you can do an initial test based on the bounding boxes only and then refine that solution. This is a popular optimization.\n\n(d) **The number of points is large.** Sorting them might improve the timing. For instance, when implementing a left\\-to\\-right line sweep point\\-in\\-polygon algorithm, you would sort the points on their first coordinate, allowing you to sweep over the points at the same time you sweep over the polygon edges. I'm not aware that such an optimization has been published. One that has been published, though, is to perform a [constrained triangulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_Delaunay_triangulation) of the union of all the points and polygon vertices: once that triangulation is complete, identifying the interior points should be quick. Computational cost will scale as O(Q\\*log(Q) \\+ (P\\+Q)\\*log(P\\+Q)).\n\n### Raster polygon data\n\nThis is incredibly easy: view the polygon layer as a binary indicator raster (1\\=inside a polygon, 0\\=outside). (This could require a lookup table to convert raster values to inside/outside indicators.) Each point probe now requires O(1\\) effort to index the raster cell and read its value. Total effort is O(Q).\n\n### In general\n\n**A nice *hybrid solution*** in the case of many static vector polygons (vector case 3 above) is initially to rasterize the polygons, perhaps even with a coarse resolution, this time distinguishing any cells intersecting any part of a polygon boundary (give them a value of 2, say). Using a raster probe (cost: O(1\\)) typically results in a definite answer (the point is known to be inside or outside), but occasionally results in an indefinite answer (the point falls in a cell through which at least one edge passes), in which case the more expensive O(log(P)) vector query is made. This method incurs some extra storage cost for the raster, but in many cases even a small raster (one MB will allow for a 2000 by 2000 raster that stores {0,1,2,null} values) can confer huge advantages in computational time. Asymptotically, the computational effort is the same as for a vector solution, but in practice it is O(Q \\+ P\\*log(P)) and possibly as low as O(Q\\+P) (achieved by using a very fine resolution for the raster and using brute\\-force methods for the very rare vector queries that have to be performed)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A GIS application needs to determine if a large number of dynamic points fall within any of thousands of static polygons.

Rasterizing the static polygons allows for O(1) lookup time for most points. Only points falling in cells intersecting polygon boundaries would require more expensive vector queries. This method balances speed and accuracy, especially for a large number of dynamic points and static polygons.\n\nC) While precomputing a quadtree would improve query time to O(Q*log(P)), it doesn't take advantage of the fact that the polygons are static and many point queries need to be performed. The hybrid raster-vector approach would likely be faster in practice.\n\nD) Sorting the points could potentially improve performance in some cases, but it doesn't take full advantage of the static nature of the polygons. Additionally, this approach would have a higher time complexity of O(Q*log(Q) + (P+Q)*log(P+Q)) compared to the hybrid raster-vector method.\n\nThe hybrid raster-vector approach (B) is optimal because it leverages the static nature of the polygons, provides fast O(1) lookups for most points, and only resorts to more expensive vector queries when necessary.

Such a 'hold' could arise because the master provided shelter/housing for the slave/servant; or paid for their schooling; or had bought the slave/servant for a set number of years; etc.. In such circumstances, I think the slave/servant was said to be *in bond* to the master for a period of years, effectively until the 'debt' (e.g. the cost of the schooling) had been paid for by their servitude. Thus the servant was *bound* (tied) to the master for that period.\n\nI've read through the whole poem (from your link) and this interpretation *could* fit \u2014 but I'm not certain that that is the meaning.\n\n[Dictionary definitions](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/bond) also support both the above meanings of *bond*:\n\n* (bonds) Ropes, chains, or other restraints used to hold someone prisoner:\n* An agreement with legal force, in particular: ... A deed by which a person is committed to make payment to another.\n\nAdditionally, the above meaning of *in bond* also still exists in the sense of dutiable goods being held *[in bond](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/in-bond?q=in+bond)*, i.e. stored in a bonded warehouse, until the importer pays the duty owing."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Rudyard Kipling's poem \"Kitchener's School,\" the line \"Wherefore, since ye are bond to that magic, O Hubshee, make haste and learn!\" uses the phrase \"bond to\".

It suggests being tied or committed to something, similar to the concept of indentured servitude or being \"in bond\" to a master. This interpretation fits the historical context and the overall theme of the poem, which discusses the relationship between the colonizer and the colonized. While it could be related to magical binding (given the mention of \"magic\" in the line), the broader context of the poem and the historical use of such language make the servitude/commitment interpretation more plausible.

In your examples, notice how you had to switch the form of the word *buy* to make both sentences sound okay.\n\nBoth *for* and *to* can be used to **explain a reason or motivation for something**. However, when used in this way, *to* is followed by a verb, but *for* is followed by a noun. Consider:\n\n> She goes to the spa on Friday **to** relax.  \n> \n> She goes to the span on Friday **for** relaxation.\n\n---\n\nHere's another interesting example:\n\n> The library is a good place **for** study.  \n> \n> The library is a good place **to** study.\n\nIn this case, the sentences are the identical except for the preposition. However, does this mean the two words are interchangeable? No, it doesn't! These two sentences are both acceptable only because *study* can function as a noun **or** as a verb. So, in the first sentence, *study* functions as a noun, aligning with meanings 8a at [Collins](http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/study):\n\n> **study** (*n.*)  \n> \n> the act or process of studying\n\nIn the second sentence, the two\\-word phrase *to study* functions as an infinitive, and therefore *study* is used as a verb, meaning:\n\n> **study** (*v.*)  \n> \n> to apply the mind to the learning or understanding of (a subject), esp by reading\n\n---\n\nI agree with some of the comments about your two sentences; that is, I think \"to buy some cake\" sounds better than \"for buying some cake.\" But I can see why you'd be confused by this, because we can find some very similar sentences in published books, like:\n\n> See if the hotel has a specified area [for walking your dog](https://books.google.com/books?id=u5eiAwAAQBAJ).\n> \n> \n> Nurses have evaluated a variety of products and methods [for bathing older adults](https://books.google.com/books?id=yUx01gmNLboC).\n> \n> \n> The whole procedure [for getting a license](https://books.google.com/books?id=yJSVZkBS7qgC) is rather complicated and requires a lot of time.\n\nWe could change those sentences to read: *to walk your dog, to bathe older adults*, and *to get a license*; any differences in meaning would be minimal. However, sometimes such changes will sound natural and acceptable, and sometimes they won't.\n\n---\n\nMost importantly, remember that little words like *for, in, of, at, with, on,* and *to* are extremely flexible. They typically have several meanings and are used in various ways, including phrasal verbs and prepositional phrases. It will be difficult, if not impossible, to pick two of these words, and give you foolproof guidance that will help you know \"which one is correct and wrong.\" When it comes to these little words, there are simply too many variations to explain everything succinctly."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following sentences demonstrates the correct usage of \"for\" and \"to\" in explaining motivation or reason?\n\nA) She goes to the gym for exercise daily.\nB) The student visits the library for study regularly.\nC) He attends night classes for improve his English skills.\nD) They travel to exotic locations for relaxing and sightseeing.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nThis question tests the understanding of how \"for\" and \"to\" are used to express motivation or reason.\n\nA) This is correct. \"For\" is followed by a noun (exercise), which is the proper usage when explaining motivation.\n\nB) While this sentence is grammatically correct, it's not the best example of explaining motivation. \"Study\" here functions as a noun, but it's less natural than using \"to study\" in this context.\n\nC) This is incorrect.

Electrons are strongly repelled from each other, so if you did have a cloud of electrons, they wouldn't stay around long.\n\nYou have the right idea, though. One way to make a neutron beam is to fire a beam of protons or deuterons into a beryllium target, which produces neutrons of roughly the same energy of the protons going in.\n\nIf you don't need a neutron *beam*, this is a very expensive way to produce neutrons, energy\\-wise. So it's not so useful in conventional reactor applications.

We do not always work on a project bases we often have smaller changes that just go through a quick change request process to trigger a developer to make the necessary changes. But my question relates more to the actual programming and anticipating that this program will be enhanced and modified in the future and often not by the same developer.\n\nIs there a strategy or a way programmers themselves can ensure there program can stand up to quick effortless modifications? Right now I am trying to ensure any developments are broken down into core function processes and function modules or objects are created to perform each process. This means that the final program is actually more a list of function calls for the various process steps. This ensures you can easily change processes called or function calls to enhance or change the code easily. This helps especially when additional validations and checks need to be built in in\\-between process steps .\n\nThis has its downfalls though, so this leads me to the question \"How does a developer code in anticipation of change?\", how would you code ensuring the next person can easily and quickly change or enhance your code?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Two very essential things to understand are that:\n\n* You can never anticipate every change a customer may ask. I had a customer who decided to switch a two months project from PHP to ASP.NET one week before release and was convinced that this would be an easy change.\n* Any change will have a cost. It doesn't matter if you are using Agile or if you have clean and extensible design, the cost will still be there.\n\nHaving said that, there are multiple techniques which lead to less expensive changes. As already noted by J\u00f6rg W Mittag, this is pretty much just \"good design\", but if you want something more specific, here are some hints:\n\n1. Avoid code duplication at all costs. Having to make a change in this class, then in this one, and finally there\u2014be careful, the code there is not exactly the same as in the first two locations\u2014would increase the cost.\n\nThe major problem here is that on large projects, developers cannot possibly know which pieces were already written and may develop their own in a different location in the code base. Clean architecture and proper documentation helps, but doesn't make the problem disappear.\n2. Your system should be decoupled as much as possible. If a small change in the module which displays generated invoices on the screen requires to rewrite a few classes in the module which handles registration of new users, there is something wrong with decoupling.\n\n\t* Decoupling may be done through interfaces. This means that you can work on the underlying logic while the interface remains the same and other parts of the system are unaffected. For example, you may have an interface for a logger component; when your customer asks to switch from `syslog` to a RabbitMQ\\-based message queue, your changes are constrained to the class which implements the given interface, and the users of this interface don't really care where the logs go.\n\n\tThe major problem here is that [interfaces may be leaky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html). For example, you move from `syslog` to RabbitMQ, and then notice a new type of exceptions when message queue service is unreachable. Classes using the logging interface should now handle this additional exception.\n\t* Additional decoupling may be achieved with Dependency injection. The benefit is that instead of working on the class itself, you create a new one, test it separately, and when ready, swap the old class with the new one, while keeping the possibility to go back to the old class seamlessly (either by modifying a *single* line of code, or through configuration).The cons is that this requires more work. If used too much (every part of the application is injected), the design may become too complicated.\n3. Environment matters as much as design. Some hints:\n\n\t* Your code should be maintainable. Spaghetti code is problematic not by itself, but specifically because it makes it difficult to modify the code base.\n\t* Uniform style matters, because it makes the code easier to read; difficult to read code is difficult to change as well.\n\t* Automated regression testing makes maintenance less stressful. A year ago I worked in a company where the key product had 0% code coverage. When somebody had to make a change, he made it, and then if something bad happened in production, *the programmer* was the culprit. This is an excellent example of how not to anticipate changes.\n\n\tThe problem is that tests should be maintained as well, so instead of simply changing code, one should change tests and code. The time spent changing tests is nothing compared to the time wasted because of the lack of proper testing, but inexperienced project managers may not understand that.\n\t* All members of the team should *be aware* of all parts of the code base (of the product, not the whole company)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software development team is working on a project that requires frequent modifications and enhancements.

For instance, a simplicial set is a contravariant functor $\\\\Delta \\\\to \\\\mathbf{Sets}$ for $\\\\Delta$ the simplex category: what is so wonderful about $\\\\Delta$ that allows a model structure (and one, moreover, Quillen equivalent to topological spaces) appear?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't think I have a compelling answer to this question, but maybe some bits and pieces that will be helpful. One point is that all of the examples that you bring up are related to the first: simplicial sets can be used as a model for the homotopy theory of spaces. Pretty much any homotopy theory can be \"described\" in terms of the homotopy theory of spaces, just like any category can be \"described\" in terms of the category of sets (via the Yoneda embedding, for example). So if you've decided that \"space\" means simplicial set, then it's pretty natural to start thinking about presheaves of simplicial sets when you want to think about the homotopy theory of (pre)sheaves of spaces, as in motivic homotopy theory. \n\nBut that just brings us to the question \"why use simplicial sets as a model for the homotopy theory of spaces\"? It's certainly not the only model, and some alternatives have been listed in the other responses. Another alternative is more classical: the category of topological spaces can be used as a model for the homotopy theory of spaces. So, you might ask, why not develop the theory of the cotangent complex using topological commutative rings instead of simplicial commutative rings? There's no reason one couldn't do this; it's just less convenient than the alternative.\n\nThere are several things that make simplicial sets very convenient to work with.\n\n1\\) The category of simplicial sets is very simple: it is described by presheaves on a category with not too many objects and not too many morphisms, so the data of a simplicial set is reasonably concrete and combinatorial. The category of topological spaces (say) is more complicated in comparison, due in part to pathologies in point\\-set topology which aren't really relevant to the study of homotopy theory.\n\n2\\) The category of simplices is (op)\\-sifted. This is related to the concrete observation that the formation of geometric realizations of simplicial sets (or simplicial spaces) commutes with finite products. More generally it guarantees a nice connection between the homotopy theory of simplicial sets and the homotopy theory of bisimplicial sets, which is frequently very useful.\n\n3\\) The Dold\\-Kan correspondence tells you that studying simplicial objects in an abelian category is equivalent to studying chain complexes in that abelian category (satisfying certain boundedness conditions). So if you're already convinced that chain complexes are a good way to do homological algebra, it's a short leap to deciding that simplicial objects\nare a good way to do homological algebra in nonabelian settings. This also tells you that when you \"abelianize\" a simplicial construction, you're going to get a chain complex\n(as in the story of the cotangent complex: Kahler differentials applied to a simplicial commutative ring yields a chain complex of abelian groups).\n\n4\\) Simplicial objects arise very naturally in many situations. For example, if\nU is a comonad on a category C (arising, say, from a pair of adjoint functors), then applying iterates of U to an object of C gives a simplicial object of C. This sort of thing comes up often when you want to study resolutions. For example, let C be the category of abelian groups, and let U be the comonad U(G) \\= free group generated by the elements of G\n(associated to the adjunction {Groups} \\<\\-\\> {Sets} given by the forgetful functor,free functor). Then the simplicial object I just mentioned is the canonical resolution of any group by free groups. Since \"resolutions\" play an important role in homotopy theory, it's convenient to work with a model that plays nicely with the combinatorics of the category of simplices. (For example, if we apply the above procedure to a simplicial group, we would get a resolution which was a bisimplicial free group. We can then obtain a simplicial free group by passing to the diagonal (which is a reasonable thing to do by virtue of (2\\) )).\n\n5\\) Simplicial sets are related to category theory: the nerve construction gives a fully faithful embedding from the category of small categories to the category of simplicial sets. \nSuppose you're interested in higher category theory, and you adopt the position that\n\"space\" \\= \"higher\\-groupoid\" \\= \"higher category in which all morphisms are invertible\". If you decide that you're going to model this notion of \"space\" via Kan complexes, then working with arbitrary simplicial sets gives you a setting where categories (via their nerves)\nand higher groupoids (as Kan complexes) both sit naturally. This observation is the starting point for the theory of quasi\\-categories.\n\nAll these arguments really say is that simplicial objects are nice/convenient things to work with. They don't really prove that there couldn't be something nicer/more convenient. For this I'd just offer a sociological argument. The definition of a simplicial set is pretty simple (see (1\\)), and if there was a simpler definition that worked as well, I suspect that we would be using it already."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains why simplicial sets are widely used in homotopy theory and related fields?\n\nA) Simplicial sets are the only model for the homotopy theory of spaces.\n\nB) The category of simplices (\u0394) has unique properties that make it ideal for topological constructions.\n\nC) Simplicial sets offer a combination of convenient properties, including combinatorial simplicity, compatibility with homological algebra, and natural connections to category theory.\n\nD) Simplicial sets are easier to visualize than other models of spaces.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. The text provides several reasons why simplicial sets are widely used in homotopy theory and related fields:\n\n1. Simplicial sets have a simple, combinatorial description as presheaves on the simplex category \u0394.\n2. The Dold-Kan correspondence connects simplicial objects to chain complexes, bridging simplicial methods with homological algebra.\n3. Simplicial objects arise naturally in many mathematical contexts, such as when studying resolutions.\n4. The nerve construction relates simplicial sets to category theory, making them useful for higher category theory.\n5. Simplicial sets offer a good balance of simplicity and effectiveness for modeling spaces in homotopy theory.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because simplicial sets are not the only model for the homotopy theory of spaces; alternatives exist, such as topological spaces.\n\nAnswer B overstates the uniqueness of the simplex category.

Tick the box under \"*In Menu*\" for easier access in the future by including it in the search menu.\n(You can also specify hidden files here, with the \"*File invisible*\" attribute)\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jin0y.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jin0y.png)\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/NBPRS.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/NBPRS.png)\n\nYou can also save those search criteria and add them to the Finder sidebar for quick access.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zi3S7.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zi3S7.png)\n\nIf the above does not yield the desired results, a [rebuild of the Spotlight index](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201716) might be required."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user is experiencing issues with their Mac computer and needs to search for specific system files.

Industrial consumers are. Therefore, in regard to ever increasing energy prices, PFC becomes very interesting at scale.

This is especially important for industrial consumers who are typically charged for reactive power draw, unlike residential users. Industrial factories tend to prioritize equipment that meets their specific requirements, including energy efficiency, rather than opting for the cheapest options.
