Track, space, drill holes and vias are a differentiators. Some companies might be conservative and quote figures which are well within capability, and others may be at the edge of their capability. \n\nLaen of [OSHpark](https://oshpark.com/) has run some tests on several services offered over the Internet, designed to reveal manufacturing defects. The test PCB's used the finest tolerances offered, and the boards failed. IIRC some percentage of the boards were supposed to have been electrically tested, and were passed, but you should double check that with Laen.\n\nAdvice I was given by some experienced designers is: *avoid* using the smallest track, space, annular ring, holes and vias offered by your PCB manufacturer, *at least* until you get comfortable with their capability. The general advice was use an extra couple of mil (thou) above the PCB manufacturer's limits on track, space and annular ring, and one or two drill sizes larger on vias and drill holes to increase the likelihood of it being made correctly every time. Leave an extra margin around board dimensions and routed holes because defects which short copper surfaces are awful to debug.\n\nOther advice included: \n\n* leave as much copper as you can on the PCB; you paid for it. More\nimportantly, the waste chemical etchant is a material which requires\ncareful handling as a pollutant, so try to minimise the amount of\ncopper removed, and so minimise waste.\n* make annular rings around holes slightly wider, and tracks slightly\nwider if the board is to be soldered by inexperienced people (e.g.\nbeginners). Beginners make more mistakes than production trained staff.\nFor example they often put parts in the wrong holes. When they remove\nthe part, they are likely to overheat a small pad, and pull it off too,\nruining the PCB.\n\nEdit: I defer to Andy aka, and other experienced community members on PCB design.\n\nThe advice I have is try to ensure 'islands' are connected to a relatively continuous ground plane using vias, and not disconnected. This is especially true around low analogue voltages and higher frequencies, where 20MHz is definitely 'high frequency'; I do MCU boards, where most high frequencies are internal to the MCU or communication interfaces e.g. USB where I take special care. Disconnected areas which are not in those contexts I might leave, especially if I am worried about heat dissipation, though I rarely have disconnected areas.\n\nHowever, I do get experienced people to give my PCBs a review. You might consider asking for a review here. I know I feel more confident after someone I respect has a look at my PCBs, not least because they might question an assumption which is no longer valid."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When designing a PCB board for low current and low frequency applications, which of the following approaches is generally recommended by experienced designers?\n\nA) Always use the smallest track width and spacing offered by the PCB manufacturer to maximize board density.\nB) Use track widths and spacings that are slightly larger than the PCB manufacturer's minimum specifications.\nC) Vary track widths randomly across the board to optimize for different current requirements.\nD) Minimize the amount of copper left on the board to reduce material costs.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The documentation advises avoiding the use of the smallest track, space, and other dimensions offered by PCB manufacturers, especially for newcomers. Experienced designers recommend using track widths and spacings that are slightly larger (e.g., a couple of mils) than the manufacturer's minimum specifications. This approach increases the likelihood of the board being manufactured correctly every time and provides a margin of safety. Additionally, it makes the board more robust for soldering, especially if done by inexperienced individuals, as larger pads and tracks are less likely to be damaged during component removal or rework."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/05/28", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/180775", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/52534/"], "docs_id": 180775, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've installed `pandoc` and `texlive-full` packages on recent Ubuntu 14\\.04 LTS 64bit to convert markdown files with russian language to PDF.\n\nEverything works fine when I run the following command:\n\n```\npandoc --latex-engine=xelatex --toc --chapters -V mainfont=\"Ubuntu\" -f markdown -o test.pdf test.md\n\n```\n\nBut in order to have russian language also in table of contents, in pictures' descriptions and etc I specify `lang` variable like this:\n\n```\npandoc --latex-engine=xelatex --toc --chapters -V mainfont=\"Ubuntu\" -V lang=\"russian\" -f markdown -o test.pdf test.md\n\n```\n\nand execution ends with the following message:\n\n```\npandoc: Error producing PDF from TeX source.\n!

One hundred and fifty guests would be gathering at some remote and deserted fictional islet called Inis an Ampl\u00f3ra off the coast of the island of Ireland to celebrate the wedding between Jules (a self\\-made woman running an online magazine called *The Download*) and Will (a celebrity appearing in a TV show program called *Survive the Night*). The day before the actual wedding day, Hannah, the wife of Charlie (Jules' friend), arrived at the island and is now at the dinner party for the rehearsal dinner with only some selected guests. And during the party, Hannah accidentally reveals that she saw *Survive the Night*, and nearly fangirled Will. At this, Charlie, who has always been disapproving Will, asks his wife when she watched it. So Hannah says she didn't watch the whole thing, but just caught the highlights. Then Peter says, \"Methinks the lady does protest too much.\"\n\nIn this part, I wonder what \"Methinks the lady does protest too much\" means.\nIs it right to understand that \"the lady\" here refers to Hannah, and that Peter is basically saying \"Stop negating, I know you're already in love with Will!\"?\n\nIn short, I am finding it difficult to understand what \"methinks\" and \"protest to much\" mean here, and who \"the lady\" refers to.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is [quote from Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_lady_doth_protest_too_much,_methinks).\n\nIt is used (in a humourous way) when someone is making denials of something so strongly that it implies that they are not telling the truth.\n\nSuppose a child has been playing with her brother outside. She comes to her mother and says \"I been really kind to Jack and I haven't hurt him at all or taken the ball from him.\" You might suspect that the child is lying, otherwise why is she making such denials.\n\nHere Hannah is denying that she has watched the show, only seen highlights, which makes Peter think that she isn't telling the whole truth."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the novel excerpt, what does Peter mean when he says \"Methinks the lady does protest too much\"?\n\nA) Hannah is being too vocal about her dislike of Will's show\nB) Hannah is exaggerating her admiration for Will's acting skills\nC) Hannah is likely not being entirely truthful about her viewership of Will's show\nD) Hannah is overreacting to Charlie's accusation about watching the show\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"Methinks the lady does protest too much\" is a Shakespearean quote often used to suggest that someone's denials are so strong that they imply the opposite of what is being denied. In this context, Peter is implying that Hannah's insistence that she only \"caught the highlights\" of Will's show, rather than watching it in full, seems suspicious.

However, for small containers like water bottles, the difference in gravitational pull from one side to the other is negligible due to the small distance involved, resulting in no observable tidal effects. The absence of an atmosphere doesn't change this fundamental principle. The mass independence of gravitational acceleration applies to free fall, not tidal forces, which is why option A is incorrect. Options C and D are based on misconceptions about how tidal forces work."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/06/02", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/233521", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/261489/"], "docs_id": 233521, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [Auto\\-deleting an answer when it gets so many downvotes or so many flags](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/233519/auto-deleting-an-answer-when-it-gets-so-many-downvotes-or-so-many-flags)\n\nMy question stems from the above link: it is actually a great question, it's clear and it's useful for others to understand why something is the way it is. Yet because people disagree with the conclusion that the question is trying to draw, it's getting seriously down voted. This would influence the user to delete the question when it really should be here for others to see because of the great answer it received.\n\nShould we be educating people better on how to vote properly?

One of those aspects which is relevant to the linked post is when a feature\\-request is made.\n\nFeature\\-requests are actual requests that the SE team reviews to see if they should be implemented. As a result of the implications of implementing features, questions tagged with feature\\-request are voted on based on the feasibility of the feature on a per user basis.\n\nUsers who disagree with a feature\\-request indicate their disagreement with a downvote. Users who agree with a feature\\-request indicate their agreement with an upvote.\n\nAs for the downvotes, I hope that user did not get discouraged as it is not meant to be directed at them so much as at the feature itself. I believe this is fairly understood by the meta community, but as a new\\-comer it can be a little counter\\-intuitive."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: On Stack Exchange Meta sites, feature-request posts often receive downvotes even when they are well-written and clear. What is the primary reason for this phenomenon?\n\nA) Users are improperly educated on voting practices and mistakenly downvote good questions.\nB) The community is hostile towards new feature suggestions and automatically rejects them.\nC) Downvotes on feature-request posts indicate disagreement with the proposed feature rather than the quality of the post.\nD) The voting system is broken and needs to be redesigned to prevent misuse.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. On Stack Exchange Meta sites, especially for posts tagged as feature-request, downvotes are used to indicate disagreement with the proposed feature rather than to criticize the quality of the post itself. This practice allows users to express their opinion on the feasibility or desirability of a suggested feature. It's important to note that these downvotes are not meant to discourage the poster but rather to provide feedback on the proposed feature to the Stack Exchange team. This voting behavior is generally understood by the Meta community but can be counterintuitive for newcomers.

With no authoritarian clues to guide us, I will indulge in some unfounded (but, I think, reasonable) speculation:\n\nMy personal guess would be that this is one of a group of words in Irish and Scottish Gaelic (since my knowledge of Scottish is quite rudimentary, I\u2019ll refer only to the Irish forms here\u2014it\u2019s quite a safe bet that most, if not all, of these also exist in some form or other in Scottish) that refer to something seen as tiny and insignificant, either something verbal or a physical object.\n\nThese words all start with *sm\\-* plus a vowel usually either /\u026a/ or /\u0250\\~\u0259/ and one more consonant. Most of the words are monosyllabic, with this consonant being then final, but some have an extra syllable, usually /\u0259/, /\u0259\u027e/, or /\u0259\u026b/ (these are all common nominal endings and are not part of the root of the word\u2014the latter two are non\\-productive diminutives). There appear to be three groups (all words taken from [Focl\u00f3ir U\u00ed Dhuinn\u00edn](http://www.scriobh.ie/Page.aspx?id=26&l=2)):\n\n> ### Final g \\= verbal\n> \n> \n> *Smiog* /sm\u026a\u0261/, *smiogal* /\u02c8sm\u026a\u0261\u0259\u026b/ \u2018tittle, word, peep\u2019; *n\u00ed raibh smiog(al) as* \u2018he didn\u2019t say a peep\u2019\n> \n> \n> ### Final d \\= verbal or physical\n> \n> \n> *Smid* /sm\u026ad\u0292/, *smaid* /sm\u0250d\u0292/ \u2018tittle, word, peep\u2019; *n\u00ed raibh smid n\u00e1 smaid aige* \u2018he had nothing to say\u2019, \u2018he was taciturnly silent\u2019  \n> \n> *Smioda* /\u02c8sm\u026ad\u0259/ \u2018piece, chunk\u2019  \n> \n> *Smiodar* /\u02c8sm\u026ad\u0259\u027e/ \u2018scrap, piece, fragment\u2019; *n\u00ed raibh smiodar den ch\u00edste romham* \u2018not a scrap of the cake was \\[left] in front of me\u2019  \n> \n> *Smeadar* /\u02c8sm\u0250d\u0259\u027e/ \u2018mess, jumble, dirty\u2019; *t\u00e1 mo l\u00e1mha \u2019na smeadar agam* \u2018my hands are all messy/dirty\u2019\n> \n> \n> ### Final t \\= physical\n> \n> \n> *Smiot* /sm\u026at/ \u2018stump, lump\u2019  \n> \n> *Smut* /sm\u0250t/, *smuit* /sm\u02e0\u026at\u0283/ \u2018stump, anything short or stumpy, piece of something, nose \\[*esp.* of animal]\u2019; *t\u00e1 smu(i)t den cheart agat* \u2018you\u2019re partly right\u2019 (lit. \u2018you\u2019ve got a stump of right\u2019); *tabhair domh smu(i)t de sin* \u2018give me a drop/bit/crumb of that\u2019  \n> \n> *Smuta* /\u02c8sm\u0250t\u0259/ \u2018bit, (small) portion\u2019; *smuta g\u00e1ire* \u2018slight smile\u2019 (lit. \u2018a small bit of a smile\u2019)\n\nThe most common way to form a diminutive in Irish (and Scottish) is to add one of the suffixes *\\-\u00edn*, *\\-(e)\u00e1n*, or *\\-\u00f3g/\\-eog* at the end; the first of these is by far the most common and productive one. It causes a preceding consonant\u2014i.e., the final consonant in the root or the final r/l in the suffix, if there is one\u2014to become slender if it isn\u2019t already (see [Irish phonology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_phonology#Consonants) for what broad and slender consonants are). Sometimes, this slenderisation is continued backwards to the root\\-final consonant even if there is a suffix, but not always; similarly, the schwa in the *\\-al/\\-ar* suffixes is sometimes deleted, sometimes not.\n\nAll the words listed above can be turned into diminutives very easily with this suffix, and quite a few of them would either coincide in Irish or be so similar that they would certainly coincide if borrowed into English:\n\n> *Smiog* \\> ***smig\u00edn***; *smiogal* \\> ***smiogail\u00edn/smigil\u00edn/smigl\u00edn***  \n> \n> *Smid* and *smioda* \\> ***smid\u00edn***; *smaid* \\> ***smaid\u00edn***  \n> \n> *Smiodar* and *smeadar* \\> ***smidir\u00edn*** (or sometimes *smidr\u00edn*)  \n> \n> *Smiot* \\> ***smit\u00edn***  \n> \n> *Smut*, *smuta*, and *smuit* \\> ***smuit\u00edn***\n\nOf these, a few are common enough to have entered the dictionaries: *smidir\u00edn* \u2018tiny piece/scrap/fragment\u2019 (this is the source of the English word \u2018smithereens\u2019, as in \u2018blow something to smithereens\u2019); and *smit\u00edn* \u2018rap, smart blow as with a stump of wood\u2019.\n\nOf the others, I myself have certainly heard people using *smid\u00edn* and *smuit\u00edn* in regular speech in Irish to refer to little scraps of paper, pieces of dust, flecks of paints, specks of dandruff, smudges\u2014things like that.\n\nMy guess would be that \u2018smidgen\u2019 (and perhaps also \u2018smudge\u2019) in English comes from one or more of these diminutives and their source words. Both \u2018smidgen\u2019 and \u2018smudge\u2019 appear to have existed originally both with a final /d\u0292/ and a final /t\u0283/, which fits perfectly with being from a mixture of these words that also vacillate between final d and final t.\n\nIt appears from a bit of Googling that [this Reader\u2019s Digest PDF](http://media.rd.com/rd/consumer_marketing/Ultimate-Word-Power.pdf) gives a similar etymology, so I\u2019m not the first to advance this theory after all, it seems."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the word \"smidgen\" and its possible origins is most accurate according to the given explanation?\n\nA) \"Smidgen\" definitely comes from the Scots word \"smitch\" and has no connection to Irish or Scottish Gaelic.\n\nB) The word \"smidgen\" likely originates from Irish or Scottish Gaelic diminutives formed from words starting with \"sm-\" that refer to tiny or insignificant things.\n\nC) \"Smidgen\" is unrelated to other English words like \"smudge\" and \"smithereens.\"\n\nD) The Oxford English Dictionary provides a clear and definitive etymology for \"smidgen\" that rules out any connection to Celtic languages.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The passage suggests that \"smidgen\" likely originates from Irish or Scottish Gaelic diminutives.

I was considering going a thermal store with a biomass boiler (wood pellet) and solar thermal, to supply:\n\n* domestic hot water\n* high temperature water for radiators\n* low temperature water for underfloor heating\n\nWhile researching these options I've discovered that underfloor heating needs carefully controlled water temperature. Installation guides for floor coverings make explicit requirements about how the materials are commissioned with respect to the underfloor heating.\n\nSo I assume that the underfloor heating system, when used in conjunction with a thermal store has some method of modifying the available water, mixing hot with cooler if hot is too hot? If this assumption is correct what part of the system manages this and where does the mixing occur?\n\n---\n\n*Update*\n\nYes, this is supposedly possible with a thermal store. Quoting from a manufacturers' website:\n\n> The Thermal Store can be used to capture energy from a variety of heat sources, such as solar, heat pumps, biomass and CHP, and is capable of providing hot water at varying temperatures to suit different heat emitters within a building. For example the Thermal Store can supply an underfloor heating system that may require 40\u00b0C, radiators requiring 70\u00b0C and hot water at 55\u00b0C, all from the same unit.\n\nYes, qualified engineers would be involved in the commissioning of such a system. However, there's an amount DIY in designing the system in the first place and I may take on some of the installation work myself (e.g. laying the pipework for the underfloor heating).\n\nI'm seeking understanding in how such a system balances the temperature requirements.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Thank you all for your input.\n\nAfter a third night of searching, I've found an answer [on this website](http://www.bordersunderfloor.co.uk/schematic_gshp2mansol.htm) that satisfies my curiosity and it turns out that the answer is quite simple: *The hot draw from the thermal store is mixed with the cold return from the underfloor heating as necessary.*\n\n> The temperature of the water entering the UFH zone is regulated by a thermostatic mixing valve. Water returning from the UFH zone is directed back into either the thermal store or the heat pump depending on the function of the heat pump and the position of the return diverter valve.\n\nThe schematic isn't an exact match for my envisioned scheme (I don't have the space for a ground\\-source heat pump and I'm not convinced by the efficacy of air\\-source), but it explains the details I was missing."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a heating system utilizing a thermal store with multiple heat sources and emitters, how is the water temperature regulated for underfloor heating?\n\nA) The thermal store automatically adjusts its internal temperature to match the underfloor heating requirements\nB) A separate buffer tank is used exclusively for underfloor heating\nC) A thermostatic mixing valve combines hot water from the thermal store with the cooler return water from the underfloor heating\nD) The biomass boiler directly controls the water temperature for underfloor heating\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, a thermostatic mixing valve is used to regulate the temperature of water entering the underfloor heating (UFH) zone. This valve mixes the hot water from the thermal store with the cooler return water from the UFH system to achieve the desired temperature.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the thermal store doesn't automatically adjust its internal temperature for different emitters. It stores water at a high temperature and relies on mixing for temperature regulation.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect as there's no mention of a separate buffer tank for underfloor heating. The system uses a single thermal store for multiple purposes.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the biomass boiler doesn't directly control the water temperature for underfloor heating.

The time derivative of the moment of inertia tensor (dJ/dt) appears in the equation of motion for a rotating rigid body when the moment of inertia is not constant. As shown in equation (4) from the provided information:\n\ndL/dt = J_I * (d\u03c9/dt) + d/dt(J_I) * \u03c9 = J_I * (d\u03c9/dt) + \u03c9 \u00d7 (J_I * \u03c9) = \u03c4\n\nThe term d/dt(J_I) * \u03c9 represents the contribution of the changing moment of inertia to the total torque \u03c4.

However, this time I'm even somewhat happy \\- that I can *ask* the question *at all*; and that is thanks to the power of animated .gif `:)`\n\nThis is the thing \\- sometimes there are some designs I'd like to replicate in Latex; usually you read your manuals, you change your lengths, things happen. However, sometimes \\- and especially after section headings \\- I'd like to say, lift up or push down the starting paragraph after the section a bit; however, without redefining the master section after skip.\n\nAnd so I usually insert a `\\vspace{\\length}` after the section heading, and start tuning `\\length`; text starts moving, and then, if I move it for say 1 pt, it almost jumps into that direction; I decrease that to 0\\.5 pt \\- the text is as if not moved at all ?! (*and then I start trying `\\vspace*`, or `\\ \\\\[\\length]`, or whatever works*). And I always want to ask about this \\- but I can never think of anything better than \"*Why does Latex jump vertical space*\", and arguably no\\-one would understand what is going on `:)`. Well, finally, this is what I mean by \"jumping\" or \"snapping\" in \"discrete steps\" ([atest\\_animate\\_10\\_p.gif](http://sdaaubckp.sourceforge.net/post/tex/atest_animate_10_p.gif), 900KB):\n\n![atest_animate_10_p.gif](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CiIvZ.gif)\n\nThe MWE for that image is below (compiled with `pdflatex`) \\- however, it is a `bash` script which generates 100 PDFs, and then extracts images from them, and finally composes the images into an animated gif. Basically, for each \"frame\" (PDF), the script changes a parameter that ends up as a length, `\\mylen`, which is used at only one place: `\\ \\\\[\\mylen]`. `\\mylen` is increased by a constant step (less than a pt) for each frame; and is written out as the first word in the paragraph.\n\nNotice that instead of a smooth transition, the paragraph \"snaps\" into place and doesn't move for certain values \\- and then when it starts moving again, it \"jumps\" more than usual. And this is actually at some step size of (*Note that you may have some hiccups in your browser while the gif loads; once it is loaded, however, the jumps should be noticeable when the paragraph doesn't move \\- and the number indication changes nonetheless... although, some frames from the gif may still end up being dropped*)\n\nWell, whenever I come to this problem, I get frustrated of the difficulty to explain it verbally. And then I think, fine \\- let me cook up an MWE, will be easier for others. Then I write up something minimal, toss `\\lipsum[1]` in there \\- and I cannot demonstrate a problem anymore !! Damn, that always gets me! That is why, the first .gif (and the MWE) is set to `\\lipsum[1-10]` \\- to demonstrate the problem; however, this is what happens if, say, `\\lipsum[1-2]` is used instead ([atest\\_animate\\_02\\_p.gif](http://sdaaubckp.sourceforge.net/post/tex/atest_animate_02_p.gif), 899KB):\n\n![atest_animate_02_p.gif](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FhYMX.gif)\n\nThat is \\- everything goes smooth, as expected (*also built with `pdflatex`*). I discovered more\\-less by accident, that you cannot demonstrate this \"jumpiness\" unless you use enough text in paragraphs, so it flows over to the next page! \n\nFinally, I thought, for fun, to generate such an animated gif, but with `lualatex` and `lua-visual-debug` \\- and this certainly explains something more ([atest\\_animate\\_10\\_l.gif](http://sdaaubckp.sourceforge.net/post/tex/atest_animate_10_l.gif), 1599KB):\n\n![atest_animate_10_l.gif](https://i.stack.imgur.com/kjr6q.gif)\n\nNamely, here it is noticeable that when the paragraphs \"lock\" into vertical position \\- one of those blue lines starts going \"up\", and then it \"jumps down\"; what does that mean, however, is beyond me `:)`\n\nSo, if anyone can explain what is happenning here \\- and is there a possibility for \"smooth\" vertical positioning of overflown paragraphs, please post back...\n\nMany thanks in advance for any answers,  \n\nCheers!\n\nHere is the MWE script code ([atextest.sh](http://sdaaubckp.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sdaaubckp/single-scripts/atextest.sh)):\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# to force exit loop:\ntrap 'echo Control-C trap caught; cleanup; exit 1' 2 #traps Ctrl-C (signal 2)\n\nMYFN=\"atest\"\nMYFNIMG=\"${MYFN}_img\"\nMYFNTEX=${MYFN}.tex\nMYFNIN=\"${MYFN}-input\"\nMYFNINTEX=${MYFNIN}.tex\n\nfunction cleanup() {\n  echo rm ${MYFNTEX} ${MYFNINTEX} -rf ${MYFN} -rf ${MYFNIMG}\n  rm ${MYFNTEX} ${MYFNINTEX}\n  rm -rf ${MYFN}\n  rm -rf ${MYFNIMG}\n}\n\nmkdir ${MYFN}\nmkdir ${MYFNIMG}\n\ncat > ${MYFNTEX} <<EOF\n\\documentclass[10pt,a4paper]{article}\n\\providecommand{\\myparam}{0.0pt}% fallback definition\n\\tracingonline=0 % suppress stdout (still dumps start)\n\n% tex.se: 47576\n\\usepackage{ifxetex,ifluatex}\n\\newif\\ifxetexorluatex\n\\ifxetex\n  \\xetexorluatextrue\n\\else\n  \\ifluatex\n    \\xetexorluatextrue\n  \\else\n    \\xetexorluatexfalse\n  \\fi\n\\fi\n\n\\ifluatex\n  \\usepackage{lua-visual-debug} % tlmgr install lua-visual-debug\n\\fi\n\\ifxetexorluatex\n  \\usepackage{fontspec}\n  \\defaultfontfeatures{Ligatures=TeX}\n  \\setmainfont[Scale=1.0]{Junicode}\n  \\newfontfamily\\myfontfam[Scale=1.0]{Junicode}\n\\fi\n\n\\usepackage[a4paper]{geometry}\n\\geometry{twoside,inner=2.5cm,outer=3.5cm,top=2.5cm,bottom=2.5cm}\n\n\\makeatletter\n\\renewcommand{\\section}{\\@startsection\n{section}%                   % the name\n{1}%                         % the level\n{\\z@}%                       % the indent / 0mm\n{-\\baselineskip}%            % the before skip / -3.5ex \\@plus -1ex \\@minus -.2ex\n{2pt}%          % the after skip / 2.3ex \\@plus .2ex\n{\\centering\\fontsize{11}{12}\\selectfont\\bfseries}} % the style\n\\makeatother\n\n\\usepackage{lipsum}\n\n\\newlength{\\mylen}\n\\setlength{\\mylen}{0pt}\n\\setlength{\\mylen}{\\myparam}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\ifxetexorluatex\n  \\myfontfam\n\\fi\n  \\fontsize{10}{12.3}\\selectfont\n\n\\title{Testing Title}\n\\date{October 31, 1000}\n\\author{John Doe\\\\\\\\ Somewhereland}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\clearpage\n\n\\input{${MYFNINTEX}}\n\\clearpage\n\n\\end{document}\nEOF\n\ncat > ${MYFNINTEX} <<EOF\n\n\\section*{Introductory words of introduction}\n\n\\vspace{\\baselineskip}\n\\vspace{2pt}\n\\begin{center}\n\\textbf{Something else here, some other words}\n\\end{center}\n\n%\\vspace{\\mylen}\n\\ \\\\\\\\[\\mylen]\n\n\\makebox[2cm][r]{\\the\\mylen}, \\lipsum[1-10] %[1-2]\n\n\\bigskip\n\n\\bigskip\n\nEOF\n\nMYPARAM=\"2.0pt\"\nJOBNAME=\"atest1\"\n\n#~ CROPPARAMS=320x240+100+400\nCROPPARAMS=400x400+150+100\n\nCMDNAME=\"pdflatex\"\n#~ CMDNAME=\"xelatex\"\n#~ CMDNAME=\"lualatex\"\n\nfor ix in $(seq 0 1 100); do\n  iy=$(wcalc -EE -q \\($ix-50\\)/50*30);\n  INDEX=$(printf \"%03d\" $ix) ;\n  JOBNAME=\"${MYFN}${INDEX}\" ;\n  MYPARAM=\"${iy}pt\"\n  echo \"\n        $CMDNAME - $JOBNAME - $MYPARAM\" ;\n  (${CMDNAME} -output-directory=\"${MYFN}\" -jobname=\"${JOBNAME}\" \"\\def\\myparam{${MYPARAM}}\\tracingonline=0\\input{${MYFNTEX}}\" 2>&1 1>/dev/null);\n  convert -density 150 -crop ${CROPPARAMS} +repage ${MYFN}/${JOBNAME}.pdf[1] ${MYFNIMG}/${JOBNAME}.png ;\ndone\n\nGRAY=\"\"\n#~ GRAY=\"-type grayscale\"\necho convert -delay 5 -loop 0 ${MYFNIMG}/\\*.png ${GRAY} ${MYFN}_animate.gif\nconvert -delay 5 -loop 0 ${MYFNIMG}/*.png ${GRAY} ${MYFN}_animate.gif\n\n# view results\n#~ evince ${MYFN}/${JOBNAME}.pdf\n#~ display ${MYFNIMG}/${JOBNAME}.png\neog atest_animate.gif 2>/dev/null\n\ncleanup # remove tmp files\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> So, if anyone can explain what is happenning here \\- and is there a possibility for \"smooth\" vertical positioning of overflown paragraphs, please post back...\n\nAs Stephan remarked this is a wonderful question to look at, but I think with all the animation and the coding around it you have fairly effectively hidden the problem.\n\nThe culprit is the `center` environment just in front of the space that you modify. The problem is that this environment surrounds itself with flexible glue (ie with a stretch and shrink component). The exact values in your case are\n\n```\n10pt plus 3pt minus 5pt\n\n```\n\nSo in the place where you have your space you really have\n\n```\n\\mylength + 10pt plus 3pt minus 5pt\n\n```\n\nAs it was remarked in other answers TeX attempts to find a page break with minimal badness. So, if we assume that the page break TeX found just naturally fits (ie no shrink or stretch is necessary) then you just get `\\mylength + 10pt` at this point. Now if you add 1pt to `\\mylength` then the last line wouldn't fit any more on the page, except that your extra point can be absorbed by the shrink on the page.\n\nNow if the only shrink available is in this very place (which it is in your example) then your extra point will just be swallowed and the space remains the same. Same story for adding another pt and another one. (If there are several places with shrink on the page then the shrink gets distributed evening across those places, so in that cases you might see a small increase but less than your step value.)\n\nBut the moment you have added 4pt it can't be compensated by the shrink available in your example. Thus the last line now really doesn't fit any more on the page and thus TeX needs to use \"stretch\" to fill the missing line (minus your 4pt), i.e., 8pt or so depending on the `\\baselineskip` setting.\n\nSo no more shrink and instead a stretch and your space makes a jump. Adding further pts will increase your space while the need for stretch gets less until you reach the point where the page again is \"natural\" without a need for stretch and then everything repeats.\n\nNow the `\\raggedbottom` setting only effects how the final page is typeset (after breaking it). Basically, the cut\\-off page is put into a bot of `\\textheight` and in case of `\\raggedbottom` a `\\vfill` is added to the bottom (more or less). Now in the \"shrink\" situation this doesn't really make a difference as the page is already overfull. And in the stretch situation it means that the stretch in the end is only applied to the bottom and not to the stretchable parts in the middle of the page.\n\n**So in summary:** to avoid your mystery you need to ensure that the space you are trying to adjust has no shrink or stretch component either as part of your adjustment or as part of space visually next to it. Only then you can ensure that the space actually behaves as you expect"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the TeX/LaTeX explanation provided:\n\nQuestion: In LaTeX, when attempting to adjust vertical space after a section heading, sometimes the space appears to \"jump\" or \"snap\" in discrete steps rather than moving smoothly. What is the primary cause of this behavior?\n\nA) The use of \\vspace command with fractional point values\nB) The default \\raggedbottom setting in the document class\nC) Flexible glue surrounding environments like 'center'\nD) The \\baselineskip value being too large\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The primary cause of the \"jumping\" or \"snapping\" behavior when adjusting vertical space is the presence of flexible glue, particularly surrounding environments like 'center'. This flexible glue has stretch and shrink components (e.g., 10pt plus 3pt minus 5pt) that interact with the added space. \n\nWhen small adjustments are made, they can be absorbed by the shrink component, resulting in no visible change. Once the adjustment exceeds the available shrink, it causes a sudden jump as TeX needs to use the stretch component to fill the page, leading to discrete steps rather than smooth transitions.\n\nOptions A and D are not directly related to this issue. While option B (\\raggedbottom setting) can affect page layout, it's not the primary cause of the jumping behavior in space adjustments."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/12/02", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4559", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/1857/"], "docs_id": 4559, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I wanted to know if there is a standard way of making licenses on Mac OS 10\\.6\\.

Some applications have a \u201cblacklist\u201d of serials that although perfectly formatted, are internally hardcoded to be bad. \n\n**Online Activation**: Less common (and usually more annoying), these require the app to connect to an online host to \u201cactivate\u201d or \u201cvalidate\u201d the license. This prevents a lot of fraud and usually ends with the application cracked by some genius, where the code that does the validation is simply modified to always return \u201cok\u201d making the application believe that the internet stuff went ok. Read: Adobe Products.\n\nIn any case, the program has to store the value somewhere, and the usual locations apply. \n\n**Tied with Hardware ID** This is common too, they extract your drive\u2019s serial number and some other parameters (Network card MAC Address for example) and they create a serial number that checks for those. So even if you \u201ccopy\u201d the license, the new machine won\u2019t have the same values and it will fail. This is annoying because if your hard drive crashes and you boot from a backup, you\u2019ll have to re\\-register. \n\n**RESOURCES**\n\nI assume you want to continue reading about this, so instead of believing me, follow these links: \n\n* [How should my Cocoa application store the user\u2019s license key?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1960660/how-should-my-cocoa-application-store-the-users-license-key)\n* [What is the best way to protect a Cocoa shareware application from software piracy?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/889861/registration-for-cocoa-shareware)\n* [MAKeyedArchived](http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?MAKeyedArchiver)\n* [Using OpenSSL for keys](http://sigpipe.macromates.com/2004/09/05/using-openssl-for-license-keys/) (good read!)\n* [AquaticPrime](http://www.aquaticmac.com/): the famous secure registration framework (free, accepts donations)\n* [Golden % Braeburn](http://www.golden-braeburn.com/): The not free method used by the famous Delicious Library (among others)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following licensing methods for Mac OS X applications is most resistant to piracy while also being the least disruptive to legitimate users?\n\nA) Storing an encrypted serial number in ~/Library/Preferences\nB) Online activation requiring an internet connection to validate the license\nC) Tying the license to a hardware ID such as the drive's serial number and network card MAC address\nD) Using a blacklist of known bad serial numbers hardcoded into the application\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption A (storing an encrypted serial number) is relatively easy to crack and share among users.\nOption B (online activation) provides the strongest protection against piracy as it requires validation with a central server, making it difficult to distribute unauthorized copies.

My question is how to best implement this considering that user shifts may change and some days they may be absent, so notifications shouldn't be sent.\n\nRight now I'm thinking about making a Shift table and assigning each user their own shift. In other words, each user has one shift, and each shift has one user. I could include it in the user table, but it's getting way too crowded. That way it can be edited easily. Maybe a second table where supervisors can save and load presets.

It reminds me of the fact that composition respects classical functional calculus but I can't justify it in this case. In any case, I also think it is relevant that $u(a), v(a) \\\\ne 1$. Can anybody formally justify why the boxed equality is true and resolve this technicality?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let $u: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\setminus \\\\{\\-i\\\\} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\setminus \\\\{1\\\\}$ denote the fractional linear transformation\n$$\nu(z) \\= \\\\frac{z\\-i}{z\\+i}, \\\\qquad z \\\\neq \\-i.\n$$\nIt can be verified that $u$ maps the real axis to bijectively to the unit circle with $1$ excluded, the upper half plane bijectively to the interior of the unit disc, and the lower half plane with $\\-i$ excluded bijectively to the exterior of the unit disc. (It follows that for any self\\-adjoint operator $s$, the operator $u(s)$ is unitary and does not have $1$ in its spectrum. With some work, this could be verified directly from a definition of $u(s)$ as $(s\\-i \\\\mathbf{1})(s\\+i \\\\mathbf{1})^{\\-1}$ if one does not want to appeal to general facts about the functional calculus.)\n\nA short computation shows that $u^{\\-1}: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\setminus \\\\{1\\\\}$ to $\\\\mathbb{C} \\\\setminus \\\\{\\-i\\\\}$ is given by\n$$\nu^{\\-1}(z) \\= \\\\frac{z\\+1}{i(z\\-1\\)}, \\\\qquad z \\\\neq 1\\.\n$$\nNote also that $\\\\frac{w\\+1}{w\\-1} \\= i u^{\\-1}(w)$ for all $w \\\\neq 1$.\n\nTurning to your problem, the operators denoted by Takesaki as \"$u(a)$\" and \"$v(a)$\" respectively are literally $u(h)$ and $u(k)$ in the sense of the above definition of the function $u$ and the continuous functional calculus. Because $u^{\\-1}$ is given by the formula above, it follows that $(u(h)\\+\\\\mathbf{1})(i(u(h)\\-\\\\mathbf{1}))^{\\-1} \\= h$ and $(u(k)\\+\\\\mathbf{1})(u(k)\\-\\\\mathbf{1})^{\\-1} \\= ik$, again where all of this is interpreted in the sense of the continuous functional calculus.\n\nIt follows that the operator denoted by Takesaki by $g$ applied to the pair \"$u(a), v(a)$\", which is literally $g$ applied to the pair $u(h), u(k)$, is (from the definition of $g$) the function $f$ applied to $u^{\\-1}(u(h)) \\+ i u^{\\-1}(u(k)) \\= h \\+ ik \\= a$, in other words, $f(a)$.\n\nSide note, the operator $u(s)$ is sometimes called the Cayley transform of the self adjoint operator $s$; von Neumann used the Cayley transform and knowledge of the spectral resolution of unitary operators to deduce the spectral resolutions of self adjoint operators.

The Cayley transform u(z) = (z-i)/(z+i) maps the real axis to the unit circle (excluding 1). For a self-adjoint operator s, its spectrum is real, so u(s) will be unitary.\n\nStatement II is correct. The Cayley transform u(z) maps the point at infinity to 1. Since a is a normal operator (bounded), its spectrum does not include infinity, so 1 is not in the spectrum of u(a).\n\nStatement III is correct. This is essentially the boxed equality in the original text, generalized for any continuous function f. It follows from the properties of the functional calculus and the inverse of the Cayley transform.\n\nStatement IV is incorrect. The Cayley transform u(z) maps the upper half-plane bijectively to the interior of the unit disc, not the exterior.

Here's my best attempt to diagram how I have the circuit set up.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/H8KqH.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/H8KqH.png)\n\nThe Raspberry Pi will also supply both power and ground. I noticed in the Raspberry Pi 2 User Manual I got with the Pi (from Vilros) that there is a short section where it is mentioned that the Pi's GPIO pins can momentarily be set to outputs when the Pi starts up, and that if you have a circuit which connects one of the pins (as an intended input) to ground it could cause a short circuit and damage the Pi if/when the pin gets reset to an output on reboot. They recommend a 300 ohm resistor between the GPIO pin and ground pin. So I'm wondering if I can/should just put a 330 ohm resistor between the black wires (the transmitter and receiver share the same ground pin) and the ground pin to prevent a possible short circuit on startup. I was also wondering if maybe putting a diode on the white wire of the receiver would also prevent this issue. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You've misunderstood a couple of things, but i'll address the overall question first \\- **Protection of the Raspberry Pi's GPIO from over\\-current conditions**\n\nThe GPIO on the R\\-Pi can be subject to over\\-current conditions for multiple reasons, not just a start\\-up glitch where what should be a high\\-impedance (aka. resistance) input is an output instead, and could possibly be an output LOW meaning it's essentially a short\\-circuit to ground inside the R\\-PI.\n\nAs a general guideline for interfacing with ANY fancy logic/computer board like the R\\-Pi, CompactRIO, or pretty much any logic board that can have access to the outside world and doesn't already have its own ruggedized inputs/outputs (some boards do! always check datasheets/schematics to see how rugged they really are) you want to add some cheap protection yourself. \n\nTypical external protection components are simply series resistors on every single GPIO in that interacts with the outside world or external voltage sources. So in this situation, a series 330 Ohm resistor between the R\\-Pi's GPIO pin and the rest of your circuits, as a middle\\-man. \n\nThe role of the series resistor is to prevent total current into, or out of, the pin to be limited and will never be able to 'short'. \n\nThe next major protection element people use to protect logic boards like these from the outside world is ESD and over\\-voltage (like TVS diodes) clamping diode arrays. Every single pin can benefit from having an ESD clamp from the pin to ground, to absorb static discharge events \\- and TVS diodes or zeners with additional resistors to allow permanent 'over voltage' situations without ever harming the logic boards on the other side of the circuit. \n\nFor your circuit you actually won't have the dangerous short\\-circuit condition on that pin, you have already got a pull\\-up resistor to the 3\\.3V rail which acts as the current limiting element. There is no other path to ground in your simple example to worry about, except maybe the IR sensor's output if that happens to have a proper high\\-current driver output (unlikely, it's most likely to be a variable resistance). \n\nIf you wanted to be super careful, and to follow the general guidelines I ranted on about earlier, you can do something like this (and add the resistor for every other GPIO which interfaces with the real world).\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ueffy.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fueffy.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nWith the 330 ohm resistor in there, the maximum input current to the GPIO pin if it was accidentally set to OUTPUT and LOW, assuming a 3\\.3V rail is connected directly to the input (but we still have the resistor there!) for whatever reason, then the maximum current will be only 10mA (3\\.3V/330R\\= 0\\.01A)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a circuit to interface an infrared breakbeam sensor with a Raspberry Pi.

The documentation emphasizes the importance of protecting GPIO pins from over-current conditions. It specifically recommends adding a series resistor (like 330 ohms) between the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pin and the rest of the circuit. This acts as a current-limiting component, preventing short circuits and protecting the pin even if it's accidentally set to OUTPUT mode.\n\nOption A is incorrect because adding a resistor between the GPIO and ground could create a voltage divider and affect the signal.\nOption B (adding a diode) might offer some protection but isn't the primary recommendation given.\nOption D is incorrect as it provides no protection at all.\n\nThe series resistor (option C) is described as a typical external protection component that limits current flow in both directions, protecting the GPIO pin in various scenarios, including startup glitches or accidental configuration changes."}, "33": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/04/21", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/365949", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/36296/"], "docs_id": 365949, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> Inspired by the discussion on <https://github.com/josephwright/beamer/issues/388>\n\nThere are many questions on this site like \"I use theme X but I'd like to have the footer/header/whatever from theme Y\", just one example: [Mix Warsaw and Madrid beamer theme](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/346686/mix-warsaw-and-madrid-beamer-theme)\n\nTo make this easier, how could one just load a specific template from a theme, for example just the footline? \n\n---\n\nTest cases\n\n> Test 1: simple case\n\n```\n\\useoutertheme{infolines}\n\\setbeamertemplate{footline}[infolines theme] \n\n```\n\n> Test 2: test if it works with parent theme\n\n```\n\\usetheme{Boadilla} \n\\setbeamertemplate{footline}[infolines theme] \n\n```\n\n> Test 3: test if it works with options\n\n```\n\\usetheme[height=3cm]{Rochester}\n\\setbeamertemplate{headline}[sidebar theme]\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Test 1\n======\n\nThis seems to work.\n\n```\n\\documentclass{beamer}\n    \\usecolortheme{whale}\n    \\useoutertheme{split}\n\\makeatletter\n    \\let\\beamer@@@@sbto@old=\\beamer@@@@sbto\n    \\def\\text@footline{footline}\n    \\long\\def\\beamer@@@@sbto#1#2[#3]#4[#5]#6{\n        \\def\\text@element{#1}\n        \\ifx\\text@footline\\text@element\n            \\beamer@@@@sbto@old{#1}{#2}[#3]{#4}[#5]{#6}\n        \\fi\n    }\n    \\useoutertheme{infolines}\n    \\let\\beamer@@@@sbto=\\beamer@@@@sbto@old\n\\makeatother\n\n\\begin{document}\n    \\begin{frame}\n        Test\n    \\end{frame}\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nTest 2\n======\n\nIf you want to gain the control over colors, do the same trick on `\\beamer@clearbeamercolor` and `\\beamer@setbeamercolor`.\n\n(The same for `\\setbeamerfont` and `\\setbeamersize`)\n\n```\n\\documentclass{beamer}\n    \\usecolortheme{whale}\n    \\useoutertheme{split}\n\\makeatletter\n    \\let\\beamer@@@@sbto@old=\\beamer@@@@sbto\n    \\def\\text@footline{footline}\n    \\long\\def\\beamer@@@@sbto#1#2[#3]#4[#5]#6{\n        \\def\\text@element{#1}\n        \\ifx\\text@footline\\text@element\n            \\beamer@@@@sbto@old{#1}{#2}[#3]{#4}[#5]{#6}\n        \\fi\n    }\n    \\let\\beamer@clearbeamercolor@old=\\beamer@clearbeamercolor\n    \\let\\beamer@setbeamercolor@old=\\beamer@setbeamercolor\n    \\def\\beamer@clearbeamercolor#1#2{}\n    \\def\\beamer@setbeamercolor#1#2{}\n    \\usetheme{Boadilla}\n    \\setbeamertemplate{footline}[infolines theme]\n    \\let\\beamer@@@@sbto=\\beamer@@@@sbto@old\n    \\let\\beamer@clearbeamercolor=\\beamer@clearbeamercolor@old\n    \\let\\beamer@setbeamercolor=\\beamer@setbeamercolor@old\n\\makeatother\n\n\\begin{document}\n    \\begin{frame}\n        Test\n    \\end{frame}\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nTest 3\n======\n\nIn this test, it is essential that `\\beamer@@@@sbto` is a long macro.\n\n```\n\\documentclass{beamer}\n    \\usecolortheme{whale}\n    \\useoutertheme{split}\n\\makeatletter\n    \\let\\beamer@@@@sbto@old=\\beamer@@@@sbto\n    \\def\\text@headline{headline}\n    \\long\\def\\beamer@@@@sbto#1#2[#3]#4[#5]#6{\n        \\def\\text@element{#1}\n        \\ifx\\text@headline\\text@element\n            \\beamer@@@@sbto@old{#1}{#2}[#3]{#4}[#5]{#6}\n        \\fi\n    }\n    \\usetheme[height=3cm]{Rochester}\n    \\setbeamertemplate{headline}[sidebar theme]\n    \\let\\beamer@@@@sbto=\\beamer@@@@sbto@old\n\\makeatother\n\n\\begin{document}\n    \\section{TEST}\n    \\begin{frame}\n        Test\n    \\end{frame}\n\\end{document}\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a LaTeX Beamer presentation, you want to use the Boadilla theme but with the footline from the infolines theme.

Option D is the correct and most comprehensive solution. It uses advanced LaTeX techniques to:\n\n1. Temporarily redefine how Beamer handles template settings (with \\beamer@@@@sbto).\n2. Temporarily disable color settings from the Boadilla theme.\n3. Apply the Boadilla theme.\n4. Set the footline to use the infolines theme.\n5. Restore the original Beamer behaviors.\n\nThis approach ensures that the footline from the infolines theme is correctly applied within the Boadilla theme, while also maintaining proper control over colors and other theme elements. The other options, while simpler, would likely result in conflicts or unexpected behavior in the final presentation."}, "34": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/09/15", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/71675", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/7323/"], "docs_id": 71675, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I seem to lack understanding the combination of an `\\edef` and the definition of a macro inside another definition.

Without the line `\\def\\do##1{##1}` this seems to work as explained, but with that line I get the mentioned error.\n\nWhat is the problem here?\n\nUsing `xparse`'s command does work\n\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{xparse}\n\\NewDocumentCommand{\\mymacro}{m}{%\n    \\def\\do##1{##1}%\n    #1%\n}\n\n\\begin{document}\n    \\edef\\savedValue{\\mymacro{argument}}%\n    savedValue: \\savedValue\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nand gives the expected output: ![result](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PLhAR.png)\n\nWhat is the actual difference to using `\\def`?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: the `\\def` operation is not expandable. In an `\\edef` `\\def` is simply a non\\-expandable token that stays unchanged.

When \\edef tries to expand \\mymacro, it encounters the non-expandable \\def command. This leads to unexpected behavior where \\do (which is typically defined as \\noexpand) is expanded prematurely, causing the \"Illegal parameter number\" error. The \\edef command expects all contained commands to be fully expandable, which is not the case with \\def.

decimal markers *and* the typesetting of thousands\\-separators, I recommend using the `S` column type of the `siunitx` package over the `D` column type of the `dcolumn` package.\n\nA nice side\\-effect of using the `S` column type is that it suffices to enclosed objects that shouldn't be aligned on decimal markers in curly braces; it is *not* necessary to write `\\multicolumn{1}{c}{...}`. Observe that in the code below, I've actually eliminated all hard\\-coded comma characters; it's the software setting `group-minimum-digits=4, group-separator={,}` that instructs LaTeX to typeset them. \n\nTo make the large table a bit easier to read, I would also add a bit of extra whitespace after every fifth row; this may be accomplished via the `\\addlinespace` directive.\n\n[![enter image

At very large scales, it distances along the surface are more curved and therefore the difference between the incorrect Pythagorean Theorem and the correct Haversine Formula is greater.\n\nDoes anyone know a formula or rule of thumb that tells you the difference between the two distance measures based on the scale of the distance you are trying to measure? \n\nI think having this explicitly would help in:\n\n1. explaining why the Pythagorean Theorem isn't perfect; and\n2. in letting people who are looking for more \"rough\" distances know when Pythagoras actually will serve their purposes.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Using the Pythagorean formula on positions given in latitude and longitude makes as little sense as, say, computing the area of a circle using the formula for a square: although it produces a number, there is no reason to suppose it ought to work.\n\nAlthough at small scales *any* smooth surface looks like a plane, the accuracy of the Pythagorean formula depends on the *coordinates* used. When those coordinates are latitude and longitude on a sphere (or ellipsoid), we can expect that\n\n1. Distances along lines of longitude will be reasonably accurate.\n2. Distances along the Equator will be reasonably accurate.\n3. All other distances will be erroneous, in rough proportion to the differences in latitude and longitude.\n\nThe error depends on the start and end point of the distance calculations. However, because both the sphere and ellipsoid have a circular symmetry around the axis, the error depends only on the *difference* of the longitudes, so to study this error we might as well take the point of origin to be at the Prime Meridian. Because both the sphere and ellipsoid are symmetric under a north\\-south reflection, we only need to study points of origin in the southern hemisphere. For any such point we may draw a contour map of the relative error, equal to \\[Pythagorean calculation] / \\[True distance].\n\nThe Pythagorean formula, using the mean radius of the earth, is\n\n```\nPythagorean distance =  6371000. * Sqrt[dx^2 + dy^2]] * pi / 180 meters\n\n```\n\nwhere *dx* is the difference in longitudes and *dy* is the difference in latitudes, both in degrees. (The difference in longitude values is reduced modulo 360 to give the correct value of *dx* when crossing the antimeridian; not doing so would introduce artificially large errors that tell us nothing about the Pythagorean formula itself.)\n\nThe following plots show the relative error compared to the correct distance on the WGS 84 ellipsoid for latitudes from \\-70 to 0 in increments of 10 degrees. The horizontal coordinate is the difference in longitudes and the vertical coordinate is the latitude of the destination. Light regions have relatively small error: the contour lines are at 1, 1\\.01, 1\\.02, 1\\.05, 1\\.1, 1\\.2, 1\\.5, 2, etc. (The pure white areas in the corners are places where the error goes beyond the range of these contours.) The red dots show the point of origin.\n\n![Plots](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UX2wR.png)\n\nThe vertical white bands testify to the correctness of expectation (1\\): Pythagorean distances are accurate when there is a small difference in longitudes. The horizontal white bands at low latitudes confirm expectation (2\\): near the Equator, horizontal distances are reasonably accurate. Otherwise, as witnessed by the extensive darker regions, at *all* other distances the Pythagorean formula is bad.\n\n---\n\nWe can make quantitative estimates of the *maximum* error attained for pairs of nearby points (within, say, a few hundred kilometers of each other). Scale\\-\\-using an appropriate value for the radius\\-\\-is true along the meridian but along a circle of latitude it errs approximately by the secant of the latitude. For example, at a latitude of 40 degrees the secant is 1\\.31, implying the Pythagorean formula will give distances about 31% too large in the east\\-west direction. (This is evident in the upper right contour plot, for a point of origin at \\-40 degrees latitude, where the region immediately east\\-west of the red dot lies between the 1\\.2 and 1\\.5 contours.) Short distances in all other directions will be too large by some amount between 0% and 31%; longer distances may err by even more (as the contour plots show)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A geographer is calculating distances between two points on Earth using latitude and longitude coordinates. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of the Pythagorean theorem for this purpose?\n\nA) The Pythagorean theorem always provides accurate results for distances between any two points on Earth's surface.\n\nB) The Pythagorean theorem is most accurate for small distances near the equator and along lines of longitude, but becomes increasingly inaccurate for larger distances and at higher latitudes.\n\nC) The Pythagorean theorem is equally accurate at all latitudes and for all distances, as long as the Earth's mean radius is used in the calculation.\n\nD) The Pythagorean theorem is only accurate for distances calculated along the prime meridian and is completely inaccurate everywhere else on Earth's surface.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The Pythagorean theorem, while simple to use, is not universally accurate for calculating distances on Earth's surface using latitude and longitude coordinates. It works best for small distances where the Earth's curvature is negligible, and is most accurate near the equator and along lines of longitude. The error increases with distance and latitude due to the Earth's spherical shape. At higher latitudes, east-west distances are overestimated, with the error proportional to the secant of the latitude. For example, at 40 degrees latitude, east-west distances can be overestimated by about 31%.

The program may then decide to exit.\n* You (or your system administrator), of course, may decide to kill the program at any time.\n\nIf your concern is to keep the program running, then:\n\n* If the program may interact with the terminal, use [Screen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen) or [Tmux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux) to run the program in a virtual terminal that you can disconnect from and reconnect to at will.\n* If the program just needs to keep running and is not interactive, start it with the `nohup` command (`nohup myprogram --option somearg`), which ensures that the shell won't send it a SIGHUP, redirects standard input to `/dev/null` and redirects standard output and standard error to a file called `nohup.out`.\n* If you've already started the program and don't want it to die when you close your terminal, run the `disown` built\\-in, if your shell has one. If it doesn't, you can avoid the shell's propagation of SIGHUP by killing the shell with extreme prejudice (`kill -KILL $$` from that shell, which bypasses any exit trigger that the indicated process has).\n* If you've already started the program and would like to reattach it to another terminal, there are ways, but they're not 100% reliable. See [How can I disown a running process and associate it to a new screen shell?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4034/how-can-i-disown-it-a-running-process-and-associate-it-to-a-new-screen-shell) and linked questions."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is troubleshooting a situation where background jobs sometimes continue running after closing the terminal, while other times they terminate. Which of the following best explains this behavior and provides a reliable solution for keeping background jobs running?\n\nA) Background jobs always continue running when the terminal is closed. No additional action is needed.\n\nB) Background jobs are managed by the operating system's job control system and will always terminate when the terminal is closed. There's no way to keep them running.\n\nC) Background jobs may continue running or terminate depending on how they handle the SIGHUP signal. Using the 'nohup' command when starting the job or the 'disown' built-in after starting it can reliably keep the job running.\n\nD) Background jobs are automatically transferred to another open terminal when the original terminal is closed. They will keep running as long as at least one terminal is open on the system.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately describes the behavior of background jobs when a terminal is closed and provides reliable solutions. When a terminal is closed, it sends a SIGHUP signal to the shell, which then propagates this signal to background jobs. How these jobs react depends on whether they're set up to ignore or handle this signal.\n\nUsing the 'nohup' command when starting a job ensures that it won't receive the SIGHUP signal and redirects its input/output appropriately. The 'disown' built-in, if available in the shell, can be used after a job has already been started to prevent the shell from sending it a SIGHUP signal.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because not all background jobs automatically continue running when the terminal is closed.

According to the documentation, the unnormalized posterior values provide a more refined view of the posterior distribution, especially in multiple dimensions. They are particularly useful for constructing Highest Posterior Density (HPD) regions. To create an HPD region at level \u03b1, one can select the MCMC simulations with the highest unnormalized posterior values up to the desired percentage, then construct a convex envelope around these points. This method offers a more precise representation of the posterior distribution compared to simple histograms, especially in higher dimensions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the mean and median of parameter estimates can be calculated directly from the MCMC samples without using the unnormalized posterior values.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the unnormalized posterior values are not used to normalize the posterior distribution.

This solution addresses several concerns:\n\n1. Testability: By separating each validation rule into its own class, you can easily unit test each validation independently without exposing implementation details.\n\n2. Single Responsibility Principle: Each validation class would be responsible for one specific type of validation, improving maintainability and adherence to SOLID principles.\n\n3. Flexibility: This approach allows for easy addition, removal, or modification of validation rules without affecting the entire validation process.\n\n4. Reusability: Individual validation classes can be reused across different parts of the application if needed.\n\nOption A doesn't solve the testing problem, as it would still only allow testing the overall result without insight into individual validations.

Shortening the wire brings the voltage at the load closer to the line voltage, but it doesn't reduce the current or temperature of the wire; instead, shortening increases the current.\n\nThe heat generated by the current in the wire affects the temperature of the wire, which is the primary limiting safety factor.\n\nThe heating of a \\#10 wire under 50ft of length is only marginally affected by its length. Provided the wire is properly installed, you generally don't get extra safety margin by keeping it short.\n\nFor a given load, a short wire generates more heat *per foot* than a long wire. This is due to the higher voltage at the load if the wire is short, and the resulting higher current through the entire wire.\n\nWhile length is an important factor in the voltage drop it is not a factor in the wire's temperature, provided the wire is installed correctly.\n\nLong wires at maximum current generate more heat over their full length than short wires at about the same current, but if installed in runs (e.g. in joist spaces, from panel to kitchen), and not in bunches or loops, the heat generated per unit of length matters, not the total heat. This is illustrated in the example below.\n\nExample: 30A over 10AWG\n-----------------------\n\nHave a look at the calculations below. They are based on a 120V supply and a 4 Ohm load to produce a nominal 30A current.\n\nAs the cabling distance (and wire length) increases, the resistance of the wire increases and reduces the current in the wire.\n\nAt the 50ft distance (100ft wire, return loop), the voltage a load has dropped to 117V (about 3% drop).\n\nThis is where the maximum length recommendations for wires (such as 50ft for 10AWG) come into the picture: the intent is to not let the voltage at a heavy load drop by too much.\n\nAs the wire takes on more resistance, so does the power generated by it over its full length. It's up to 85W over a 50ft distance.\n\nHowever, the power generated \"per foot of length\" is more indicative of the temperature rise of the wire, and that power drops from 1\\.8W/ft to 1\\.7W/ft.\n\nThis drop is not much but it should dissuade anyone from thinking that the the maximum current of 30A for a AWG10 wire can somehow be exceeded if the wire is short. No, short wires cannot tolerate more current than long wires.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/T30Jb.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/T30Jb.png)\n\nPower drops for very long wires\n-------------------------------\n\nI did make an earlier statement that the power per foot as well as the total power drop as the wire is lengthened. This is partially true: the total power increases and the power per foot decreases for the \"electrician's\" use cases such as the one illustrated here, whereby the wire resistance is (much) smaller than the load's resistance.\n\nBut in in a more *general* context (not applicable to an electrician's case) the wire can have a resistance equal or more than the load. Then as the wire is lengthened more and its resistance starts to exceed that of the load the total power generated by the wire will diminish as the wire becomes longer.\n\nHave a look at the additional cases below. This shows what happens when the wire resistance starts to exceed that of the load. The numbers here are a bit ridiculous, but that's because I just kept using 10AWG. Nevertheless, these kinds of effects do occur in an electronic signalling systems with much lower gauge wires.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DaHqP.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DaHqP.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is installing a 10 AWG wire for a 30A circuit in a residential setting.

The current rating is based on heat generation, not length.\n\nOption B is wrong because while voltage drop decreases with shorter lengths, this does not increase the wire's current-carrying capacity.

As explained in the documentation, for a given load, a short wire generates more heat per foot than a long wire.

Two days ago, it got into an [Automatic Repair Loop](https://superuser.com/questions/605158). \n\n![Auto Repair Error](https://i.stack.imgur.com/NtVSC.jpg)\n\nWe have done much research and have made many attempts to fix this, but have not yet found the way to fix it. A lot of other people have had these problems as the key error phrases show up in numerous forums, but we realized many of these solutions applied to Windows 7 or earlier and many refer to the older boot system rather than the newer UEFI boot system used on our system. \n\nWith Windows 8, there is a Windows Recovery Environment, which is a partition on the drive with tools to help you recover without needing to boot off a startup DVD. From the Recovery Environment, we can go into a Command Prompt with what seems to be full administrator rights, from where we have attempted fixes.\n\nWe have already done the following:\n\n1. Checked the Automatic Repair log file which says:\n\nBoot manager failed to find OS loader.  \n\n Boot configuration data store repair. Result: failed. Error Code \\= 0x2\n2. Chkdsk c: /r \\- Which repaired a few file references but found no bad sectors\n3. Tried the standard boot recovery procedures (in various orders as written elsewhere) \n\nbootrec /fixmbr  \n\n bootrec /fixboot  \n\n bootrec /rebuildbcd  \n\n bootsect /nt60 all /force /mbr \n\nThese did not help. The bootrec /rebuildbcd line gives: \"Total identified Windows installations: 0\"\n4. Tried to [repair the bootloader](http://woshub.com/how-to-repair-uefi-bootloader-in-windows-8/). See [related superuser question](https://superuser.com/questions/460762/how-can-i-repair-the-windows-8-efi-bootloader).\n\ndiskpart  \n\n lst dsk  \n\n select disk 1  \n\n lst vol  \n\n select volume 4 (This is our FAT32 partition)  \n\n assign letter b:  \n\n exit  \n\n cd /d b:\\\\efi\\\\microsoft\\\\boot  \n\n bootrec /fixboot  \n\n ren BCD BCD.bak  \n\n bcdboot c:\\\\windows\\\\system32 /s b: /l en\\-us /f ALL\n\nThe last line results in the message: \"Failure when attempting to copy boot files\"\n5. Tried to do a System Restore, but system restore said there were no restore points.\n6. Tried Running the system file checker:\n\nsfc /scannow\n\nThat gives the message: \"There is a system repair pending which requires reboot to complete\". But a reboot does not change this.\n\nThe idea I have is to manually recreate the Boot Registry hive. I've seen illustrations on how to do this with instructions such as:\n\n```\n attrib -h -s C:\\boot\\BCD  \n del C:\\boot\\BCD  \n bcdedit /createstore c:\\boot\\bcd.temp  \n bcdedit.exe /store c:\\boot\\bcd.temp /create {bootmgr} /d \"Windows Boot Manager\"  \n bcdedit.exe /import c:\\boot\\bcd.temp  \n bcdedit.exe /set {bootmgr} device partition=C:  \n bcdedit.exe /timeout 10  \n attrib -h -s C:\\boot\\bcd.temp  \n del c:\\boot\\bcd.temp  \n\n```\n\nHowever, it is not clear what this does and I'm not willing to experiment with it, especially since my bcd is not in that directory and my Windows Recovery Environment makes the files accessible without the need of the attrib statement. \n\nThere is a nice Superuser question: [How can I repair or install startup repair/system recovery after BCD corruption?](https://superuser.com/questions/421467/how-can-i-repair-or-install-startup-repair-system-recovery-after-bcd-corruption) which tells about a [Visual BCD Editor](http://www.boyans.net/) that seems to have a big learning curve, and I'm leery to try unless I have a clear guide on how to set up my BCD. I also don't know if it will run under the Windows Recovery Environment.\n\nSo my two main roadblocks to my fixing this seem to be:\n\n1. Bootrec is not recognizing my Windows installation on C drive. It says there are 0\\.\n2. Reconstructing my Boot Registry hive: b:\\\\efi\\\\microsoft\\\\boot\\\\BCD\n\nThese are probably related problems, and it might be that fixing one may easily solve the other.\n\nThe Windows 8\\.1 installation and all our user data is still safe and I can see it all from the command prompt. And it seems that I'm so close, but just can't get past those two roadblocks.\n\nWhat will allow me to fix this without reinstalling Windows?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The fix we took was a real cop\\-out. We bailed and simply restored the system to initial state from the recovery disk. We did have a backup of the data that was only 2 weeks old so we didn't lose much, and still had access to the disk and copied over a few extra files we wanted prior to the restore.\n\nThe main point is we saw via Google how many people have had this problem. A lot! It looked like a simple fix, and we tried nearly everything.\n\nThe bottom line is we spent 3 days trying to solve this problem. That was probably 2 days too long, because it only took us a day to restore and load our backup data and reinstall our software. i.e. It's nice to figure out how to fix something if you can, but we were already starting to waste time and wanted our computer back.\n\nI hope this helps someone."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Windows 8.1 system is stuck in an Automatic Repair Loop.

I found this [Bind selenium to a specific IP \\- Possible?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10607806/bind-selenium-to-a-specific-ip-possible) but I am not sure what is the proper IP as it would be safe. Every solution uses different IP 192\\..... 127\\.... Is it important which one I choose or it does not matter?\n\nI mean it is necessary if is necessary to restart HUB as the code will refer to the same HUB IP\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is important in the sense how do you want this hub to be reachable; only from the same machine, or from others too.  \n\nThe question is not that much selenium, but rather networking one; so here are the three most common options:\n\n* use `127.0.0.1` \\- a.k.a. \"localhost\", the loopback interface \\- the hub will be reachable only from the same machine, and no other. By definition the loopback interface is nonroutable in the networks \\- all packets are staying within the same host, thus \\- no one else can send a packet to it (because their packet will not leave their machine). In short, the hub and the selenium client must be on the same machine for this scenario.\n* `192.168.x.y`, `10.x.y.z` or just an ip address `a.b.c.d` \\- the selenium hub process will bind to this address, and as long as it is reachable any client will be able to communicate with it (vs just local when using the loopback). If the server has multiple network interfaces, the hub is going to be accessible only on the one you specified.\n* the `0.0.0.0` \\- that is not an actual ip address (cannot be assigned, and used only for specific/special cases like DHCP), but used to communicate to the OS the process wants to bind to *all* available ip addresses on the host. So if it has 2 network interfaces, one with ip `1.2.3.4` and the other `192.168.100.57`, the hub will be reachable on both of them (plus localhost, `127.0.0.1` this is also an address). This by the way is the default behavior of Selenium Hub (and most server services).\n\nSo pick one depending on your needs \\- limiting to local connections only, to a specific interface if you have a few, or to all of them.\n\nBy the way, the question you link to is a little bit different \\- apparently when it was raised, Selenium had a bug that the binding to a specific address didn't work, it was always using the `0.0.0.0`option."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software development team is setting up a Selenium Hub for their automated testing infrastructure.

While this would restrict access to the Hub, it would only allow connections from the same machine, which is too restrictive for a team environment.\n\nB) 192.168.1.100 is the correct answer. This is a private IP address typically used in local area networks. By using this address (or a similar address in the 192.168.x.y range), the team ensures that the Selenium Hub is accessible within their local network but not from the public internet, meeting their security requirements while still allowing team-wide access.\n\nC) 0.0.0.0 is a special address that tells the system to listen on all available network interfaces. This would make the Hub accessible from anywhere, including potentially the public internet, which goes against the team's security requirements.\n\nD) 10.0.0.1, while also a private IP address, is not necessarily the best choice without more information about the team's network configuration. It could be correct in some scenarios, but 192.168.x.y addresses are more commonly used in small to medium-sized local networks.\n\nThe correct choice allows for team-wide access within the local network while maintaining security by preventing external access."}}
