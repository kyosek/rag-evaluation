By publishing the external data as a web service or RSS feed, you create a layer of abstraction between SharePoint and the external database. This approach offers several advantages:\n\n1. Security: It doesn't require direct database connection credentials to be stored in SharePoint.\n2. Performance: The web service can be optimized for read operations and caching.\n3. Flexibility: Using a Content Editor web part with custom JavaScript allows for client-side sorting and filtering without putting load on the database.\n4.

What makes it special is that it is a *de facto* standard way to indicate to a program that the string started by it is an \"option\" argument. In fact, many (if not most) programs in the Unix/Linux ecosystem rely on the external [`getopt()`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getopt) function for that purpose1, which is part of the POSIX specification and provides a standardized way to handle command\\-line parameters, and the convention of interpreting parameters that start with `-` as \"options\" is embedded there.\n\nSo, the single quotes ensure that the `-|h4ker|-` is passed verbatim from the shell to the program (`cat` in your case), [but also removes the quotes in that process](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Quote-Removal.html). Hence the program still thinks that since this parameter starts with a `-`, it should be treated as an \"option\" argument, not an operand (like a file name to process).\n\nThis is the reason why many programs (again, all that rely on `getopt()`) interpret the `--` token on the command line as a special \"end\\-of\\-options\" indicator, so that they can safely be applied to files that start with `-`.\n\nAnother possibility, which you already explored in your investigation, is to \"protect\" the filename by either stating it as an absolute filename (`'/path/to/file/-|h4ker|-'`) or prepend the current directory (`'./-|h4ker|-'`), because then, the argument will no longer start with the \"ambiguous\" `-`. *Note that quoting/escaping is still necessary in this example* because the `|` is a shell metacharacter.\n\nA nice demonstration is trying to create and list a file named `-l`:\n\n```\n~$ touch '-l'\ntouch: Invalid option -- l\n~$ touch -- '-l'\n~$ ls '-l'\n\n< ... the entire directory content in long list format ... >\n\n~$ ls -- '-l'\n-l\n~$ ls -l -- '-l'\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 0 Feb 24 17:16 -l\n\n```\n\n---\n\n1 For shell scripts, there is an equivalent [`getopts`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getopts) builtin command"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When dealing with filenames that begin with a hyphen (-) in Unix/Linux command line operations, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA) Single quotes always prevent the shell from interpreting the hyphen as an option flag\nB) The -- (double dash) argument is a universal solution that works with all commands to treat subsequent arguments as filenames\nC) Prepending ./ to the filename will always solve the issue without need for additional quoting or escaping\nD) The hyphen is treated as a special character by the shell in the same way as wildcards or variable expansion characters\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because while single quotes prevent shell expansion, they don't prevent the program from interpreting the hyphen as an option flag.\nB is correct because -- is a widely adopted convention (stemming from the getopt() function) that tells programs to treat all subsequent arguments as filenames or operands, not options.\nC is incorrect because while prepending ./ can work in many cases, it doesn't address issues with other special characters in filenames that may need escaping or quoting.\nD is incorrect because the hyphen isn't a special shell character like wildcards or $ for variables; its special treatment comes from how programs interpret command-line arguments, not from the shell itself."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/03/15", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/420269", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/5355/"], "docs_id": 420269, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want the label of a node to be included in the node, I use for that\nlabel \\= {\\[below]: label} but if I do that, the text of the node is written above the label.

The game is a common table\\-top miniature game, where one must roll certain dice in succession but only if you've previously scored a success.\n\nTo give frame to the question, let's assume the following:\n\n1. The initial number of dice to be rolled is 20\n2. If a roll is 'successful' then that die is used in the next round of rolling, and if it is 'unsuccessful' then it is removed\n3. There are 3 rounds of rolling\n4. Round 1 success is determined by a roll of 4, 5, or 6\n5. Round 2 success is determined by a roll of 3, 4, 5, or 6\n6. Round 3 success is determined by a roll of 5 or 6\n\nNow the issue I have is that quite often people will look at the overall expected value of the dice rolling game and make assumptions based on this. In our scenario, with 20 dice and consecutive probabilities of success of 1/2, 2/3, and 1/3, the overall expected value of our final successful dice at the end of round 3 would be 2\\.22 (if not rounding to whole numbers).\n\nHowever I'd imagine that the individual variance (if I'm using the correct word here) of any given set of dice rolls would play a far more important role than that final expected value given the relatively small sample space of only 20 initial dice.\n\nSo my question is two\\-fold:\n\n1. How many dice would you have to roll to be relatively certain of getting close to your expected value of final successes?\n2. Given the above example of rolling 20 dice, what certainty would you have in getting that expected value?\n\nFor argument's sake, let's say that I'd like to be 90% certain of getting within 1 either side of my expected value for question 1 \\- and feel free to use the above numbers to illustrate if it's easier.\n\nHappy to answer any clarifications as required!\n\nThanks for your help!\n\nEDIT FOR CLARIFICATION:\n\nLet\u2019s take my problem to an extreme. With the probabilities for success as above (50%, 66\\.6%, then 33\\.3%), if I were to roll 1 die my \u2018expected\u2019 outcome mathematically to get three successful rolls would be 0\\.11\\. However, by the end of the three rolls I will either have a value of 0 successes, or 1\\. Both are distant from my expected value.\n\nEven if we increase the number of dice to 10, with a now increased expected value of final successes of 1\\.11, it\u2019s plausible that I could end up with 6 successes overall, which again would be distant from my expected value.\n\nHowever, if I increased the number of dice to 10,000,000, there\u2019s a high probability that my final successes would be close to my expected value of 1,111,111 given the likelihood that many outlying rolls would not confer statistical significance.\n\nSo, at what \u2018number of dice\u2019 rolled does the probability of my final results falling within, say, one standard deviation on either side of my expected value, become 90%? How many dice must I roll before the chances of \u2018randomness\u2019 affecting my overall result is statistically reduced to less than 10% ie. I am 90% likely to achieve final successes within one standard deviation on either side of my expected value?\n\nHope that clarifies it somewhat!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Perhaps the simplest thing to do here is just to compute the probability of every possible outcome at the end of the three\\-stage process. For the sake of broader interest, let me generalise your description of the problem by supposing we have a $K$\\-round process with $n$ initial dice, with $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta} \\= (\\\\theta\\_1, \\\\theta\\_2, ..., \\\\theta\\_K)$ as the respective success probabilities for each round of the process. We will also assume that the successes for each die over each round are independent with these fixed probabilities.\n\nOne simpler way of looking at this is to suppose that you roll all dice in all rounds, but a die is only a success at the end of the process if it rolled successfully in all rounds. This is equivalent to your stipulated process, where dice are removed if they do not roll successfully in a given round. To facilitate the analysis, let $X\\_{i,k}$ denote the indicator variable for a successful outcome with the $i$th die on the $k$th round. Then you have independent indicators with distribution $X\\_{i,k} \\\\sim \\\\text{Bern}(\\\\theta\\_k)$. Let $Y\\_i$ denote the indicator variable for a successful outcome with the $i$th die over all rounds. Then you have independent indicators with distribution:\n\n$$Y\\_i \\= \\\\min (X\\_{i,1},...,X\\_{i,K}) \\\\sim \\\\text{Bern} \\\\Bigg( \\\\prod\\_{k\\=1}^K \\\\theta\\_k \\\\Bigg).$$\n\nConsequently, the distribution for the total number of successful outcomes $Y$ for the process is:\n\n$$Y \\\\sim \\\\text{Bin} \\\\Bigg( n, \\\\prod\\_{k\\=1}^K \\\\theta\\_k \\\\Bigg).$$\n\nThe mean and variance of the total number of successes is:\n\n$$\\\\mathbb{E}(Y) \\= n \\\\prod\\_{k\\=1}^K \\\\theta\\_k\n\\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \n\\\\mathbb{V}(Y) \\= n \\\\Bigg( \\\\prod\\_{k\\=1}^K \\\\theta\\_k \\\\Bigg) \\\\Bigg( 1\\-\\\\prod\\_{k\\=1}^K \\\\theta\\_k \\\\Bigg).$$\n\nI will not address your other question regarding the number of initial dice required to get within a certain bound of the expected value with a certain probability. That is not a particularly interesting question and so I will leave it to you to compute from the present functions if it is something of interest. Once you have the probabilities of every possible outcome for any initial number of dice, you can get a good sense of what is likely to happen in this process.\n\n---\n\n**Example:** In your example you have $n\\=20$ initial dice and you have a process with $K\\=3$ rounds with success probabilities $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta} \\= (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}, \\\\tfrac{2}{3}, \\\\tfrac{1}{3})$. We can compute and plot the probabilities for the number of successes at the end of the process as follows.\n\n```\n#Set the parameters\nn     <- 20\nprobs <- c(1/2, 2/3, 1/3)\n\n#Compute the success probabilities\nPROBS <- dbinom(0:n, size = n, prod(probs))\nnames(PROBS) <- 0:n\n\n#Plot the success probabilities\nbarplot(PROBS, col = 'blue',\n        main = 'Successes at End of Process',\n        xlab = 'Number of Successes', ylab = 'Probability')\n\n```\n\nIn this particular example the mean number of successes is $\\\\mathbb{E}(Y) \\= 20/9 \\= 2\\.2222$ and the variance is $\\\\mathbb{V}(Y) \\= 160/81 \\= 1\\.9753$. The standard deviation of the number of successes is $\\\\mathbb{S}(Y) \\= \\\\sqrt{160/81} \\= 1\\.4055$. (Your intuition about the mean of the process is accurate.) You can see from the barplot that you are most likely to get two successes from this process, slightly less likely to get one or three successes, and so on.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jGp5M.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jGp5M.jpg)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a tabletop miniature game, 20 dice are rolled in 3 successive rounds.

This option is represented by choice C.\n\nOption A (sudo ufw reload) only reloads the UFW firewall rules but does not apply changes made to the before.rules file.\n\nOption B (sudo iptables-restore < /etc/ufw/before.rules) directly manipulates iptables, which can interfere with UFW's management of the firewall and is not the recommended approach when using UFW.\n\nOption D (sudo ufw disable && sudo ufw enable) disables and re-enables UFW, which may reset some configurations and is more disruptive than necessary.\n\nThe \"sudo service ufw restart\" command safely restarts the UFW service, applying all changes made to the configuration files, including before.rules, without requiring a full system restart."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/07/01", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/930960", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/485007/"], "docs_id": 930960, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: By using `stat -c \"%a %n\" *` I'm getting file permissions in octal mode (such as 755\\), Is there any way to see the file permissions in binary mode (such as 111 101 101\\)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For a single file:\n\n```\nstat -c \"%a\" filename.txt | xargs -I PERM echo \"obase=2; ibase=8; PERM\" | bc\n\n```\n\nAnd as a more clear script for more that of one file:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\nfor file in *\ndo\n  perm=$(stat -c \"%a\" \"$file\")\n  bin=$(echo \"obase=2; ibase=8; $perm\" | bc)\n  echo \"$bin $file\"\ndone\n\n```\n\nthe output:\n\n```\n110110100 baz\n110110100 foo\n110110101 bar\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n\n* First we loop into all files and directories using `for file in *`.\n* With `stat -c \"%a` we gather the file permission in octal, then\n* Using `echo` we add other necessary details to `permission` and pip it to `bc`.\n* Finally `bc` does the conversion and then we printout the result and file name.\n* obase\\=2; means output should be in binary, ibase\\=8 means our input is in octal and $perm is the file permission in octal like 664\\."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the correct bash script to display file permissions in binary mode for multiple files in the current directory?\n\nA) \n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nfor file in *\ndo\n  perm=$(stat -c \"%a\" \"$file\")\n  bin=$(echo \"ibase=2; obase=8; $perm\" | bc)\n  echo \"$bin $file\"\ndone\n```\n\nB) \n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nfor file in *\ndo\n  perm=$(stat -c \"%a\" \"$file\")\n  bin=$(echo \"obase=2; ibase=8; $perm\" | bc)\n  echo \"$bin $file\"\ndone\n```\n\nC) \n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nfor file in *\ndo\n  perm=$(stat -c \"%b\" \"$file\")\n  bin=$(echo \"obase=2; ibase=8; $perm\" | bc)\n  echo \"$bin $file\"\ndone\n```\n\nD) \n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nfor file in *\ndo\n  perm=$(stat -c \"%a\" \"$file\")\n  bin=$(echo \"obase=8; ibase=2; $perm\" | bc)\n  echo \"$bin $file\"\ndone\n```\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the correct script to display file permissions in binary mode for multiple files.

Hopefully I'm not too much of a caveman to express myself properly.\n\nWhat does thermal conductivity actually express? Is it measuring the *amount* of heat that transfers through a material? Or the speed at which the heat transfers? Or some combination of the two? Or something else?\n\nFor example, if I have a wall with such\\-and\\-such thermal conductivity and a heat source on one side, what does thermal conductivity actually tell me for the amount of heat that will be transferred to the other side, how long that will take, and so on?\n\n**Edit:** if thermal conductivity is the *speed* of heat transfer, what am I to make of the fact that dense materials like concrete and compressed earth blocks have a high thermal conductivity (\u22481\\.5\\) relative to dedicated insulation materials (\u22480\\.04\\), yet heat transfers through them slowly\\-\\-this property being explicitly utilized in certain applications, in fact, such as passive solar design.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Thermal conductivity measures the speed at which heat energy travels through material.\n\nThat's different to the speed at which changes in *temperature* travel through material, which is driven by a combination of thermal conductivity and thermal mass.\n\nSo, to use your example, concrete has a high thermal conductivity: it will lose heat energy quite quickly, so a hot thing inside a concrete box can cool down quite quickly. However, concrete has high thermal mass: it takes a lot of energy to raise its temperature by 1 Kelvin. So even with heat going into it quickly, its temperature will rise slowly.\n\nThat's why concrete and earth walls are used in some passive solar designs: not necessarily for their insulation properties, but for their properties as a heat *buffer*: they can absorb a lot of heat for relatively low changes in their own temperature, and radiate it back out again. That gives you a wall surface with a fairly steady radiant temperature, which feels a lot more comfortable than a surface with a highly variable radiant temperature; and it gives you a huge buffer that allows you to store solar energy in the day and release it at night, thus giving you cooling during the day when you need it, and heating during the night when you need it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A passive solar design utilizes a thick concrete wall.

The high thermal conductivity allows heat to move through the material relatively quickly, while the high thermal mass means it can absorb and store a large amount of heat energy without significantly changing its own temperature. This combination allows concrete walls to act as heat buffers, absorbing excess heat during the day and releasing it slowly at night, helping to maintain a more stable indoor temperature. Options A and C are incorrect because concrete has neither low thermal conductivity nor low thermal mass. Option B is partially correct but incomplete, as it doesn't account for concrete's high thermal mass, which is crucial for its effectiveness in passive solar design."}, "39": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/02/23", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/635001", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/183000/"], "docs_id": 635001, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm having trouble with beams.

When I delete the unwanted spaces, I get the first image, which shows that your notes have the normal stems, and the beam starts nicely (accidentally) at the top of the first note's stem, but then slope 2 is not enough for covering the others.\nThe right code to connect the notes is:\n\n```\n\\ibu1f2\\qb1f\\zcn{-7}{sol}\\qb1g\\zcn{-7}{la}\\qb1h\\zcn{-7}{si}\\tbu1\\qb1i\n\n```\n\n[![image 1, disconnected stems](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VyGtz.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VyGtz.png)\n[![image 2, connected stems](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MRr5m.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MRr5m.png)\n\nThe second image shows that the last stem is a little bit shorter than the first.\nOther problems in your examples are:\nYour text is placed arbitrarily due to the spaces inserted. As you can see in my images, the syllable always starts on the left of the note. If you want it centered, you could use \\\\ccn (paragraph 17\\.3 of the musixdoc manual), but it does not align nicely, much more effective (if you do not want to invoke musixlyr) is `\\zsong{*text*}` or `\\csong{*text*}`, without the need of indicating a hight (see paragraph 23\\.1\\). The advantage is that musixtex then uses the notes as measure for the horizontal distances. Text is always tricky in music, at least when you do not tell musixtex how long your text is. I used the various forms in the first measure of the third example.\n[![image 3, text placing](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SPvHJ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SPvHJ.png)\n\nAnother problem is your use of the slurs. The first starts too early.

By that time, the original interest had drained away, leaving the site to wither. The site is alive, but I wouldn't at all be surprised if it died soon.\n\nWhat should be the metrics?\n\n1. A minimum number of users is required.\n2. How much does the community seem to be forming before the community has officially started?\n3. Some number of users willing to help police the site.\n4. Length of time seems important, perhaps length of time since last visit.\n\nHow could we get there?

It might turn into a free for all early on, but the dust will settle, and the site can be recovered. Science Fiction and Fantasy is living proof of such a site, it was rocky at first, but now stands as a very solid site. All it took was a few people with the power and interest to set the site on the right course. \n\nAs for more of a list:\n\n1.

(Self\\-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology; often\n> written as SMART) is a monitoring system included in computer hard\n> disk drives (HDDs) and solid\\-state drives (SSDs) that detects and\n> reports on various indicators of drive reliability, with the intent of\n> enabling the anticipation of hardware failures.\n\nIt has no effect whatsoever on the performance of your SSD."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) is a feature found in many modern storage devices. What is the primary purpose of SMART, and how does its status (enabled or disabled) affect drive performance?\n\nA) SMART is designed to improve drive speed, and disabling it will significantly reduce performance.\nB) SMART is a security feature that encrypts data, and disabling it makes the drive vulnerable to attacks.\nC) SMART is a monitoring system that detects potential drive failures, but its status does not affect drive performance.\nD) SMART is a backup technology, and disabling it means the drive cannot create automatic backups.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: SMART is a monitoring and reporting tool designed to detect and report on various indicators of drive reliability. Its primary purpose is to anticipate potential hardware failures. The status of SMART (enabled or disabled) does not affect the speed or functionality of the drive. It is purely a diagnostic feature and has no impact on performance. Option A is incorrect because SMART doesn't improve speed. Option B is wrong as SMART is not a security or encryption feature.

If the circuit breaker or fuse is rated 20A then you can use 12 AWG (or larger) wire.\n\nIf the existing wire is 14 AWG but the circuit breaker or fuse is 20A then you have a problem and the circuit needs to changed to 15A or the wire replaced with 12 AWG.\n\n### Wiring\n\nThere are a couple of ways to do this. The simplest is to connect the existing wire, in a junction box, to an outlet (either in that junction box or run a cable to a new junction box in a preferred location) and then run another cable (either pigtailed to the first one or off the second set of screws on the outlet) to the switch and light.\n\nI don't know if GFCI is required for the receptacles.

This approach allows for proper separation of circuits, provides flexibility for future modifications, and follows best practices for electrical installations. Option A doesn't provide a proper connection for the outlet. Option B misuses the GFCI load screws and could cause issues with the light if the GFCI trips.

The empirical CDF used in the non-parametric bootstrap does indeed have approximately N parameters (where N is the sample size), which could lead to overfitting concerns for smaller sample sizes. However, this high number of parameters also allows the bootstrap to flexibly estimate the underlying distribution without making strong parametric assumptions. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the bootstrap converges asymptotically, finite sample properties are still a concern.

ORMs handle most common queries efficiently, while allowing for custom optimizations when necessary. This approach aligns with best practices in MVC architectures for database interactions."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/12/06", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/33154", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/422077/"], "docs_id": 33154, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The old method that works for Leopard/Snow Leopard doesn't work any more on Lion: \n\n```\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/kamus/Pictures/snap\n\n```\n\nHas something changed or does anyone have some good workarounds?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Perhaps it's because your path isn't really a path to a folder:\nNotice to terminating `/`:\n\n```\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/kamus/Pictures/snap/\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In macOS Lion and later versions, when attempting to change the default location for screen captures using the Terminal command, which of the following is the correct syntax to ensure the new path is properly recognized?\n\nA) defaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/username/Pictures/snap\nB) defaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/username/Pictures/snap/\nC) defaults write com.apple.screencapture path /Users/username/Pictures/snap\nD) defaults write com.apple.screencapture directory /Users/username/Pictures/snap/\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct syntax to change the default screen capture location in macOS Lion and later versions is option B: \n\"defaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/username/Pictures/snap/\"\n\nThis is because:\n1. The command uses \"defaults write\" to modify system preferences.\n2. \"com.apple.screencapture\" is the correct identifier for screen capture settings.\n3. \"location\" is the correct parameter to specify the new directory.\n4. The path must end with a trailing slash (/) to explicitly indicate it's a directory path.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's missing the trailing slash.\nOption C is incorrect because it uses \"path\" instead of \"location\".\nOption D is incorrect because it uses \"directory\" instead of \"location\".\n\nThe trailing slash is crucial in this context, as it ensures the system recognizes the path as a directory rather than a file, which was a change implemented in macOS Lion and later versions."}}
