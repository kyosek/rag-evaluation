Moved firefox to screen 2, waited a minuted, moved my mouse to power on the screens \\-\\> firefox and everything else is back at primary screen.\n\nI've uninstalled nvidia drivers completely, restarted and then installed them again but it looks like this wasn't it.\n\nIs there something fancy, that can be done in that situation? I know this is not the default behaviour as I've had several 2\\-screen set\\-ups in my life and none showed this behaviour.\n\nScreen 1 is connected via HDMI and Screen 2 via DVI\\-D.\nI cannot switch the connections as Screen 2 has no HDMI or Display Port.\nBut AFAIK DVI or HDMI shouldn't really matter\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have tried numerous fixes which are in answers to similar questions on various forums, and none has really fixed the problem. Apparently, Microsoft initiates restoration of each window as soon as the logon prompt is displayed, and checks to see that the screen real estate is there as it does so. When it wakes the monitors, there can be a delay before a monitor is detected by the OS, and Windows uses a default simulated monitor if there is no monitor detected yet. Microsoft likes this behavior, as it prevents loss of access to offscreen windows if you reduce the number of screens, especially after someone disconnects a projector from a laptop at the end of a meeting. \n\nThis delay in the monitor becoming visible to the system could also depend on how the monitor is attached to the system (VGA, HDMI, DVI or DisplayPort), and how the graphics adapter reports the monitor configuration during wake\\-up. With my setup (Radeon R9 260, LG monitors, primary on PowerPort, older, smaller one on HDMI) it seems like the monitor configuration isn't fully visible to Windows until the little monitor health windows both go away.\n\nI have found that I can avoid most moving and resizing if I am patient and careful about how I wake the system. \n\nThe problem seems to be that pressing a key or mouse button initiates both wake and logon in a single action. Even while logon initiation is waiting for you to enter a password or select a different user, it starts waking up the windows from the previous session to save time. Therefor it can be looking at the monitor configuration to make sure the window placement is valid before many monitors wake and become ready and visible to the system. \n\nThe trick is to separate wake from login initiation. One way is to use the computer power button to wake, assuming it is set to do that. One of my keyboards has a wake/sleep button, and that also works. \n\nThe way that I generally use is to move the mouse (an arrow key would also work) to start to wake the system up, and then wait for the monitor to fully wake before pressing any other key or the mouse button to get the logon prompt. My monitors display a little window of configuration info at startup, and if I wait until both of those have disappeared before I press a key or mouse button to get the login prompt, the windows generally come up where they belong. I wait to see the background wallpaper up without a login prompt until the monitor initiation is complete, and then click to bring up the logon prompt.\n\nIf I start by pressing the mouse button or any of the other keyboard keys, or if that has happened since the computer went to sleep even if I never logged on, it seems to initiate both wake and logon (displaying the default user and accepting the password) at the same time. This causes the system to start waking up windows, program by program, without being able to see the monitors, and they all end up in the top left of my primary monitor. Sometimes, say if I move the mouse but then press the button too fast, some programs (say, Excel and Bing) have their windows moved there, and others (Chrome and Word, maybe) have them still where they were. I think that tends to confirm my theories above of why this works.\n\nThere is also a tendency of some windows to migrate down and right a bit on wakeup; I don't see much of a solution to that except to extend the window to the bottom or right edge of the screen, or at least to near it (hitting the bottom in Win10 tends to extend the window vertically over both screens, in a top/bottom configuration)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary reason for windows moving to the primary screen after waking up from sleep mode in a multi-monitor setup, according to the StackExchange answer?\n\nA) The graphics card drivers are outdated or corrupted\nB) Windows intentionally moves windows to prevent loss of access to offscreen content\nC) The monitor connection type (HDMI, DVI, etc.) causes incompatibility issues\nD) The user is not patient enough when waking up the system\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The answer explains that Microsoft initiates restoration of each window as soon as the logon prompt is displayed. If there's a delay in detecting all monitors, Windows uses a default simulated monitor, which can cause windows to move to the primary screen. This behavior is intentional to prevent loss of access to offscreen windows if the number of screens is reduced, such as when disconnecting a projector from a laptop after a meeting.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the answer mentions that reinstalling drivers did not solve the issue. Option C is not the primary reason, although connection types can affect the speed at which monitors are detected. Option D, while patience is mentioned as a workaround, is not the root cause of the problem."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/04/06", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/352849", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/55429/"], "docs_id": 352849, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have to show that $\\\\lim \\\\limits\\_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}\\\\frac{n!}{(2n)!}\\=0$ \n\n---\n\nI am not sure if correct but i did it like this :\n$(2n)!\\=(2n)\\\\cdot(2n\\-1\\)\\\\cdot(2n\\-2\\)\\\\cdot ...\\\\cdot(2n\\-(n\\-1\\))\\\\cdot (n!)$ so I have $$\\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{1}{(2n)\\\\cdot(2n\\-1\\)\\\\cdot(2n\\-2\\)\\\\cdot ...\\\\cdot(2n\\-(n\\-1\\))}$$ and $$\\\\lim \\\\limits\\_{n\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{(2n)\\\\cdot(2n\\-1\\)\\\\cdot(2n\\-2\\)\\\\cdot ...\\\\cdot(2n\\-(n\\-1\\))}\\=0$$ is this correct ?

When this property is true, Magento will call the initialize() method of the payment method, passing a stateObject. This allows the payment method to set custom order state and status, potentially different from the default Order::STATE_PROCESSING. The initialize() method can set the state, status, and even control customer notification. If $_isInitializeNeeded is false or not set, Magento will use Order::STATE_PROCESSING as the default state and process the payment action directly.

(Say the sheaf $\\\\mathscr O(\\-2\\)$ on $\\\\mathbb P^1$). Then take $\\\\mathcal A$ to be the category of coherent sheaves on $X$, \n$K^\\\\bullet\\=\\\\mathscr F$ (that is $K^0\\=\\\\mathscr F$ and $K^i\\=0$ for $i\\\\neq 0$) and consider the hypercohomology corresponding to the global section functor. By construction $h^n(K^\\\\bullet)\\=0$ for $n\\\\neq 0$, but $\\\\mathbb H^n(K^\\\\bullet)\\\\neq 0$ for some $n\\>0$. (In the case of \n$\\\\mathscr O(\\-2\\)$ on $\\\\mathbb P^1$, we have $\\\\mathbb H^1(K^\\\\bullet)\\\\neq 0$). \n\nObviously there are many similar examples."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider an abelian category A with enough injectives and a complex K\u2022 in Kom+(A), the category of cochain complexes over A bounded on the left.

Hypercohomology is defined on the derived category, and an exact (or acyclic) complex is quasi-isomorphic to the zero object in the derived category. This implies that its hypercohomology vanishes.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because hypercohomology vanishes for both exact and acyclic complexes.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect.

I can close the door over the power cord, but the door seal isn't flexible enough to enclose the power cord, so it creates a crack. \n\nMy idea is to make a small hole in the seal, for the power cord. If it is a tight fit, the cold loss during mixer operation will be minimal. But I don't plan to keep the mixer there permanently, so I'll have to seal the hole somehow. \n\nI think that an earplug will be the best seal. It is easily removed, and once inserted, it will expand to fit the hole perfectly. The foam should be a fairly good isolator. \n\nWhile it looks to me that this will work, it sounds slightly lunatic from some angles. Not being an experienced DIYer, and afraid to end up with a freezer which is constantly heated through a badly sealed hole, I want to ask you: Do you think this will work? Are there drawbacks I am missing? (Beside the freezer spending extra energy to cool a working motor, I think I can live with that). And are there better ways to do this? \n\n**update** in response to ppumpkin \n\nThis is a standalone freezer, not a compartment in a fridge. It has no lightbulb or thermostat on the inside. \n\nThe mixer will only be put in the freezer for ice cream making, so it won't be there most of the time. \n\nI have already thought of putting a socket in the freezer, caulking the hole for the power cord coming from outside. But while I can get wet\\-room rated extensions, the cords of premade extensions are too thick to lead through the seal. So I'll have to make the extension myself, which is much less secure than connecting the mixer to a socket outside. \n\nThe other idea was to build my own \"mixer\" from a 6 V DC motor and operate it from a li\\-ion battery. But not only is it lots of work, li\\-ion batteries at \\-18\u00b0C aren't a good idea. So I still think that connecting the mixer outside is better. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Put the cord/hole in the top of the door, and it really won't matter:\n\nThe cold air is heavier than the air around it. So your freezer full of cold air is like a bucket of water: the cold air is trying to flow out only where gravity will let it. Other than the stirring of air causing the mingling of warm and cold air, a freezer doesn't need a top at all. Ever wondered how the open\\-top freezers at the grocery store stay frozen? They're a big bucket, and the cold air is trapped by gravity.\n\nSo take advantage of that: Put your cord inlet at the top of your freezer, and don't worry about sealing it. The mixture/transfer of air at the cord inlet point will be negligible."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An amateur ice cream maker wants to operate a small mixer inside their freezer. Which of the following solutions would be the most effective and practical for allowing the power cord to enter the freezer while minimizing cold air loss?\n\nA) Create a small hole in the door seal and use an earplug to block it when the mixer is not in use\nB) Install a wet-room rated electrical socket inside the freezer\nC) Build a custom battery-operated mixer using a 6V DC motor and li-ion batteries\nD) Make a hole for the power cord at the top of the freezer door\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most effective and practical solution. Placing the cord inlet at the top of the freezer takes advantage of the fact that cold air is heavier than warm air and tends to stay at the bottom. This means that even without a perfect seal, cold air loss would be minimal. It's also simpler and safer than the other options.\n\nOption A, while creative, could potentially damage the door seal and may not provide a reliable long-term solution. Option B involves complex electrical work and potential safety hazards. Option C is labor-intensive and impractical, especially since li-ion batteries don't perform well in extremely cold temperatures.

Process 1 maps one of its virtual page to physical frame 1\\.\n2. Context switches to process 2\\.\n3. Process 2 swaps out frame 1 and replace with its own content.\n4. Context switches back to process 1\\.\n\nHow does process 1 knows that it does not own the content of frame 1 and needs to do a swap in?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Technically, \"process1\" doesn't know this. There is a set of page\\-tables for each process. The kernel knows which process it will switch to, and switch the page\\-tables around. A part of these page\\-tables is the kernel, which is shared between ALL processes (so, a certain part of the address range, typically in the range of 0xc0000000 to 0xffffffff \\- although not ALL of those pages will be present). Typically, this shared section is achieved by simply making all the page\\-table sets point at the same shared section of \"kernel page\\-table bits\". \n\nHaving this shared section allows the kernel calls, traps and interrupts to go into the kernel, no matter which process is currently running, or what that process is doing. \n\nExactly how this works depends on the architecture the kernel is built for, but for example in x86(32 and 64 bit), CR3 is the register that points to the current page\\-table. So for each process, there is a pointer to the page\\-table, and it is loaded into CR3, as part of the switch to the new process, just like the register values (at least the stack\\-pointer) is restored for the process 1 when it is being switched in."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Linux system using virtual memory, what mechanism ensures that Process 1 correctly accesses its own memory after a context switch, even if another process has modified the physical frame?\n\nA) Process 1 checks the frame content before each access\nB) The CPU's CR3 register is updated to point to Process 1's page table\nC) Process 1 maintains a separate copy of its memory content\nD) The kernel notifies Process 1 of any changes to the physical frame\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. In Linux's virtual memory system, each process has its own set of page tables. When a context switch occurs, the kernel updates the CPU's CR3 register to point to the page table of the process being switched to. This ensures that when Process 1 resumes execution, it uses its own page table, which maps its virtual addresses to the correct physical frames or indicates the need for a page fault if the data has been swapped out.\n\nOption A is incorrect because processes don't check frame content before each access; this would be extremely inefficient.\n\nOption C is incorrect as maintaining separate copies would defeat the purpose of virtual memory and be highly inefficient.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the kernel doesn't directly notify processes about changes to physical frames. Instead, it manages this transparently through the page table mechanism.\n\nThis question tests understanding of virtual memory management, context switching, and the role of page tables and CPU registers in memory access."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/07/04", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/104188", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/934/"], "docs_id": 104188, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been having a play and reading the [help](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2/index.html#/What_are_reports_in_ArcGIS/004v00000001000000/) about a part of ArcMap I don't really use and that is the Reports.

the userPrincipalName looks to be the external directories upn followed by '\\#EXT\\#' followed by this primary domain\n* the login email can be found at: otherMails\\[0]\n* creation type is: null\n\n**Local User**\n\n* the userPrincipalName looks to be some object id followed by this primary domain\n* the login email can be found at: signInNames\\[0].value\n* creation type is: LocalAccount\n\n**Social User**\n\n* the userPrincipalName looks to be 'cpim\\_' followed by some object id followed by this primary domain\n* the login email can be found at: otherMails\\[0]\n* creation type is: null\n\nAlthough we can see some trends we'd rather not make guesses or bad assumptions. So we have the following questions:\n\n1\\) What is the best way to know which of the four types of user we're looking at?\n\n2\\) Is there a simpler way to get the login (ideally as one field, we're trying to build this into a simple mapping)? Other than :\n\n```\nIf signInNames[0].value is not null use signInNames[0].value\nElseif otherMails[0] is not null use otherMails[0]\nElse userPrincipalName\n\n```\n\n3\\) Do other social users behave differently? (We've only done Facebook so far.)\n\n4\\) For social users what is the best way of knowing which identity provider is used?\n\n**UPDATE 11/8:**\n\n5\\) Why don't LocalAccount users get an otherMail value?\n\n6\\) Why don't non\\-LocalAccount users get sign\\-in names? I guess that was added exclusively for B2C?\n\n7\\) Also I guess end users don't really have the ability to associate social and local accounts today? (unless using an app which leverages graph).\n\n**UPDATE 11/8 \\#2:**\n\n8\\) Is it safe (for now) to assume that I can disambiguate a B2C signed\\-up individual who can only login with a social account using the following criteria:\n\n* creation type is: null \\- meaning they're not a Local User\n* userPrincipalName is prefixed with 'cpim\\_' followed by a UUID \\- meaning they are PROBABLY not a Standard or Guest user\n\nOr would there be a better method?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1\\) These are not mutually exclusive properties. For example, a local account, guest or member user can also link their multiple social profiles to their account. The underlying data (available via Graph API) does not make any assumptions.\n\nThe most reliable way to know whether an account is a local user or not is to look at creationType property. You can also look at signInNames. Having said that, that would not imply that the user will not have their social profile linked in the future. It's just that this functionality is not exposed in B2C standard policies.\n\n2\\) `signInNames` is certainly used for signing in the user. However, a user can also have more than one `signInName` as far as the directory is concerned. That is why `signInNames` is a collection. So a utility company or bank may have an account id and email address both as `signInNames`.\n\n`otherMails` is not a property used to sign in a user. So you may want to skip that. Think of `otherMails` as an email address that is not used for any critical function by the directory (e.g. it's not used for sign in or for password resets etc.)\n\nYou would use `userPrincipalName` for work accounts.\n\n3\\) All social accounts are considered as external user identities, and are mapped in the same way. They are not yet available through Graph API, but when they are, they will appear as a collection too since a user may link to multiple social accounts.\n\n4\\) Not possible today, but coming in the future.\n\n**UPDATE 11/8** to answer additional questions\n\n5\\) Simply because there is no email address in B2C standard flow to add in `otherMails` for local account users. The email address they used to sign up is already in `signInNames` property. Through Graph API, you could add `otherMails`, and when a token is issued, it will show up in the `emails` claim even for local account users.\n\n6\\) Non\\-local account users do not get a `signInName` because they do not need to sign in using a `signInNames`. Work accounts use the `userPrincipalName` instead which can be tied to Office 365, Exchange, or on\\-premise AD. Social IDPs have external identities. So, there is no known scenario in which `signInNames` needs to be used for non\\-local accounts at least today.\n\n7\\) Yes, it is not possible today to link a social account with a local account through standard policies, but can be done through custom policies. It is also not yet possible through Graph API (because external identities are not yet exposed), but will be possible in the future when the API is exposed.\n\n**Update 11/24:**\n\n8\\) If you look at user principal name, you will notice it is random. cpim\\_ can be removed any time, it is not part of the contract. In fact, IMHO, it should be removed already so apps do not take a dependency on it.\n\nTo determine this correctly, we are expecting to announce a new \"userIdentities\" property on the user account, using which you can determine which social IDPs is the user account linked to. That would be the best way to do this."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding user types and their identification in Azure AD B2C?\n\nA) The creationType property is always set to \"LocalAccount\" for B2C users who signed up with email.\n\nB) The userPrincipalName prefixed with 'cpim_' is a guaranteed method to identify social users.\n\nC) The signInNames property is used exclusively for local account users and is never present for other user types.\n\nD) User types are not mutually exclusive, and a local account user may have social profiles linked in the future.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because while creationType can be used to identify local accounts, it's not always set for every local account user.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the 'cpim_' prefix in userPrincipalName is not a guaranteed or contractual way to identify social users and may be removed in the future.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while signInNames is commonly used for local account users, it's not exclusive to them. Other user types could potentially have signInNames in certain scenarios.\n\nOption D is correct because the documentation explicitly states that user types are not mutually exclusive. Local account users can have social profiles linked to their accounts in the future, especially if custom policies or future API developments allow for such linking."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/06/08", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/27090", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/2920/"], "docs_id": 27090, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I try to setup an Java Application with Hibernate and PostGIS but I always get nasty exceptions like :\n\n```\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.hibernate.type.CustomType.<init>\n  (Lorg/hibernate/usertype/UserType;[Ljava/lang/String;)V ....\n\n```\n\nAfter looking around I got the impression that the PostGIS JDBC driver is not compatible with Hibernate, which would be strange. \n\nI'm using :\n\n* hibernate\\-spatial 1\\.1\\.1\n* PostGIS JDBC 2\\.0 (the link for 2\\.1 is dead ...)\n* postgresql\\-8\\.4\\-702\\.jdbc4\n* Hibernate 3\\.2\\.5\n\nThe table I try to map is \n\n```\nCREATE TABLE \"cRef\" (\n    \"id\" SERIAL NOT NULL,\n    \"contenttype\" varchar(200),\n    \"contentid\" varchar(200) NOT NULL,\n  PRIMARY KEY(\"id\")\n);\nSELECT AddGeometryColumn ('cRef','geom',4326,'POINT',2);\n\n```\n\nfrom my hibernate.cfg.xml:\n\n```\n<hibernate-configuration>\n    <session-factory>\n        <property name=\"hibernate.dialect\">org.hibernatespatial.postgis.PostgisDialect\n        </property>\n\n```\n\nand my classpath contains:\n\n```\nhibernate-spatial-1.1.1.jar and \nhibernate-spatial-postgis-1.1.1.jar\n\n```\n\nCan anyone recommend me a working setup?

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this error, given the information provided?\n\nA) The PostGIS JDBC driver is incompatible with the version of Hibernate being used\nB) The hibernate-spatial and hibernate-spatial-postgis JAR files are missing from the classpath\nC) The version of Hibernate (3.2.5) is too old and incompatible with hibernate-spatial 1.1.1\nD) The PostgisDialect class is not properly configured in the hibernate.cfg.xml file\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) While compatibility issues between PostGIS JDBC and Hibernate can occur, this specific error is more likely related to version mismatches between Hibernate core and Hibernate Spatial.\nB) The classpath is explicitly stated to contain these JAR files, so this is not the issue.\nC) This is the most likely cause. The NoSuchMethodError suggests that the method being called in the CustomType class doesn't exist in the version of Hibernate being used. Hibernate 3.2.5 is quite old, and Hibernate Spatial 1.1.1 may require a newer version of Hibernate core.\nD) While the dialect configuration is important, an incorrect configuration would typically result in a different type of error, not a NoSuchMethodError.\n\nThe key to diagnosing this issue is recognizing that NoSuchMethodError often indicates a version mismatch between dependencies, and noting the old version of Hibernate being used compared to the more recent Hibernate Spatial library."}, "19": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/08/12", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/21627", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/9724/"], "docs_id": 21627, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Safari has started display scrambled text on some websites.

So we don't need to use the preposition \"to\" before \"there\" or \"here\" in the same way as we don't use \"to\" before home when it's used as an adverb to mean \"to the place we live\". \n\nI think it'll not be out of place if I mention that, although here/there means to/at/in this/that place, we use in/over before these adverbs such as it's hot in here, put it over there, etc. in conversation."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which statement best explains the grammatical difference between \"I have never been to China\" and \"Have you been there\"?\n\nA) \"To\" is omitted in the second sentence because it's a question.\nB) \"There\" inherently includes the meaning of \"to that place,\" making \"to\" redundant.\nC) \"Been\" changes its meaning in questions and doesn't require \"to.\"\nD) \"To\" is only used with specific country names, not with \"there.\"\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The adverb \"there\" inherently includes the meaning of \"to that place,\" making the preposition \"to\" redundant. This is why we say \"Have you been there?\" instead of \"Have you been to there?\" The word \"there\" functions as an adverb of place, encompassing the idea of direction or location without needing an additional preposition.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the question form doesn't determine the use of \"to.\"\nOption C is wrong because \"been\" retains its meaning in both statements and questions.\nOption D is incorrect as \"to\" can be used with various place names, not just countries.\n\nThis question tests understanding of adverbs of place, prepositions, and subtle differences in English sentence structure."}, "28": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/10/09", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/80186", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/30566/"], "docs_id": 80186, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Although I understand the derivation of boundary condition in case of steady electric current but I did not understand, that the electric field which is in direction of $J$ current density that is applied between two conducting medium so that if we analyse this electric field we should get that both tangent and normal component bet two medium is the same not only tangent component and the value of $J$ change due to different value of conductivity bet medium while the direction should still the same.\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QAlyw.png)\n\nok my question what if the field like i draw why the direction of current change although the same source should make the current,electric field in both conductors in the same direction ![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/D6YhS.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm not exactly clear what your question is. Your two equations have two distinct sources:\n\n* The normal components must be equal, $J\\_{1n}\\=J\\_{2n}$, because otherwise there would be an accumulation of charge into the surface, which cannot be sustained in the steady state. This is because, for a normal from 1 into 2, the flow of charge that exits medium 1 in a small area $dA$ is $J\\_{1n}dA$ and the charge entering medium 2 is $J\\_{2n}dA$.\n* The tangential components on the other hand, can be different, because charge is just flowing past the boundary at different speeds. On the other hand, the electric field's tangential components must be continuous across the boundary, because otherwise there would be a nonzero circulation in the loop in your image. In a metal where Ohm's law holds, the current density is proportional to electric field,\n$$\\\\mathbf{J}\\=\\\\sigma \\\\mathbf{E}$$\nand therefore the current density's tangential components will not in general be constant across the boundary.\n\nThis actually makes a lot of sense physically. Consider the following situation: two conductors of (smallish) conductivities $\\\\sigma\\_1$ and $\\\\sigma\\_2$ are \"sandwiched\" between conducting plates with an applied voltage:\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wSAJu.png)\n\nHere you'd expect the current to be vertical, and greater in the material with greater conductivity.

The normal component of J must be continuous (J\u2081\u2099 = J\u2082\u2099) to prevent charge accumulation at the boundary in steady state.\n2. The tangential component of E must be continuous to avoid infinite circulation of the electric field.\n3.

The function formats this as \"%d:%02d\", where %d is for minutes and %02d is for seconds (padded with a leading zero if necessary).\n\nTherefore, 3723 seconds is equivalent to 62 minutes and 3 seconds, formatted as \"62:03\".\n\nOption B is incorrect because the function doesn't handle hours separately.\nOption C is incorrect as it's a decimal representation, not the format used by the function.\nOption D is incorrect as it doesn't convert the seconds at all."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/10/03", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/382503", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/278659/"], "docs_id": 382503, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just [learned](https://meta.stackexchange.com/posts/382484/revisions) that Meta Stack Exchange has a tag [hidden\\-features](/questions/tagged/hidden-features \"show questions tagged 'hidden-features'\") *and* a tag [easter\\-eggs](/questions/tagged/easter-eggs \"show questions tagged 'easter-eggs'\"), and apparently at least one site regular sees sufficient difference between these tags to replace one by the other in an edit.

I read that Einstein first thought of this tensor to be the one that goes into his field equation but it didn't fit. Now, I know why this was problematic. There is a clear explanation of that. What I am asking is, is there a formulation of theory of gravity where equations give us directly $R$ and not $G$? $G$ is Einsteins tensor and $R$ Riemanns. Because, non\\-relativistic equation was used and directly translated, with energy\\-momentum tensor. Is there some other tensor related to the physics which would give $R$ instead of $G$? $G$ itself is not curvature...but from $G$ I guess we could calculate $R$ so there should be some equation that gives $R$ directly?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The formulation you are looking for exists. Starting off from Einstein's field equations: ($R\\_{ik}$ Ricci tensor, $R$ curvature scalar and $T\\_{ik}$ the stress tensor and $g\\_{ik}$ the metric tensor, $\\\\kappa\\=\\\\frac{8\\\\pi G}{c^4}$ with $G$ gravitational constant)\n\n$$R\\_{ik} \\-\\\\frac{1}{2}g\\_{ik} R \\= \\\\kappa T\\_{ik}$$\n\nOne can alternatively move one index up in all tensors:\n\n$$R\\_i^k \\-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\delta\\_i^k R \\= \\\\kappa T\\_i^k$$\n\nand then taking the trace (we put the indices $i$ and $k$ equal and sum over it according to Einstein's summation convention):\n\n$$ R \\= \\- \\\\kappa T$$\n\nwith $T \\= T\\_i^i\\\\equiv\\\\sum^3\\_{i\\=0} T\\_i^i$. We substitute this expression for $R$ in Einstein's original field equations and bring the term with $T$ on the right side:\n\n$$ R\\_{ik} \\= \\\\kappa\\\\left(T\\_{ik} \\-\\\\frac{1}{2} g\\_{ik} T\\\\right)$$ \n\nand if you like with the Riemann curvature tensor according to the definition of the Ricci tensor $R\\_{ik}:\\=g^{lm} R\\_{limk}$\n\n$$ g^{lm} R\\_{limk} \\= \\\\kappa\\\\left(T\\_{ik} \\-\\\\frac{1}{2} g\\_{ik} T\\\\right)$$"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In an alternative formulation of Einstein's field equations, the Riemann curvature tensor is directly related to the stress-energy tensor.

So, it is likely to coincide with the center of mass.\n\nBut, the gravitational field varies as we move away from earth or as we go high.

The center of mass will move as if the net force were applied there, according to the principle of motion of the center of mass.

It first checks if the customer is not logged in using !$this->customerSession->isLoggedIn(). If true, it creates a redirect to the login page. If the customer is logged in, it returns the result page. This approach ensures that unauthorized users are redirected to the login page, while logged-in users can access the intended page. Options A, C, and D either have incorrect logic or do not properly handle both logged-in and non-logged-in scenarios."}, "42": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/01/18", "source": ["https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/379121", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/5858851/"], "docs_id": 379121, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Consider the following scenario:\n\nA well written question with an MCVE is posted that asks why a piece of code isn't working.

In this case the solution you can provide is some combination of:\n\n> You need to upgrade to v2\\.1 to use `bar`\n\nand\n\n> You need to use library `foobar` to replicate this functionality in v2\\.0\n\nand\n\n> You can use this code to accomplish the same task \n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> function magicbar(x) {\n>     return x * somemagic;\n>     } \n> \n> ```\n\nThe reason multiple solutions are important (assuming they exist) is because it may help someone.

The issue is that the function they're trying to use is only available in a newer version of the software. Another user comments with a link to the documentation confirming this. What is the most appropriate course of action?\n\nA) Vote to close the question as off-topic, since it's about software versioning rather than programming.\nB) Convert the comment into an answer, stating only that the function is not available in their version.\nC) Post a comprehensive answer explaining the version issue, providing upgrade information, and suggesting workarounds or alternative solutions for their current version.\nD) Delete the question and advise the user to contact the software vendor's support team.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate action is to post a comprehensive answer (option C). This approach is best because:\n\n1. It directly addresses the user's question about why their code isn't working.\n2. It provides valuable information about version compatibility, which is crucial for understanding the issue.\n3. It offers multiple solutions (upgrading, workarounds, or alternatives), which can help both the original poster and future readers who might face similar issues but have different constraints.\n4.

It aligns with the StackExchange philosophy of creating a repository of high-quality questions and answers that can benefit many users over time.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they remove potentially valuable information from the site.

Then $f(x) \\= (x\\-r\\-c\\_1\\) (x\\-r\\-c\\_2\\) \\\\cdots (x\\-r\\-c\\_d)$ for some subset $\\\\{ c\\_1, c\\_2, \\\\ldots, c\\_d \\\\}$ of $\\\\mathbb{F}\\_p$. So the coefficient of $x^{d\\-1}$ in $f$ is $\\-\\\\sum (r\\+c\\_i) \\= \\- (dr \\+ \\\\sum c\\_i)$; we deduce that $dr \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}\\_p$. If $d \\\\neq 0 \\\\bmod p$, then $r \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}\\_p$ which is plainly false, so $d\\=0$ or $p$ and the factorization is trivial.\n\nIf I were to try to turn this proof into a general technique, I suppose I would frame it as \"prove that the Galois group is contained in a cyclic group of order $p$, and observe that it can't be the trivial group, so it must be the whole group.\" \n\n---\n\nI can also prove the generalization. Define a $\\\\mathbb{F}\\_p$\\-module endomorphism $T$ of any commutative $\\\\mathbb{F}\\_p$\\-algebra by $T(u) \\= u^p\\-u$. Set $F(n) \\= \\\\mathbb{F}\\_{p^{p^n}}$. Observe that\n$$T^r(x) \\= \\\\sum\\_{k\\=0}^r (\\-1\\)^{r\\-k} x^{p^k} \\\\binom{r}{k}.$$\n\n**Lemma** $T$ is an $\\\\mathbb{F}\\_p$\\-linear endomorphism of $F(n)$ whose Jordan\\-normal form is a single nilpotent block (of size $p^n$).\n\n**Proof** Obviously, $T$ is $\\\\mathbb{F}\\_p$\\-linear. Observe that\n$$T^{p^n}(x) \\= \\\\sum\\_{k\\=0}^{p^n} (\\-1\\)^{p^n\\-k} x^{p^k} \\\\binom{p^n}{k} \\= x^{p^{p^n}} \\- x$$\nso $T^{p^n}$ is zero on $F(n)$ and we know that $T$ is nilpotent. Finally, $T(x) \\= x^p\\-x$ so the kernel of $T$ is one dimensional, and we see that there is only one Jordan block. $\\\\square$\n\nNow, let $p^{n\\-1} \\\\leq r \\< p^n$. Roland's polynomial is $T^r(x) \\= a$ for $a$ a nonzero element of $\\\\mathbb{F}\\_p$. Using the Lemma, the image of $T^r: F(n) \\\\to F(n)$ is the same as the kernel of $T^{p^n\\-r}$. In particular, since $a \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Ker}(T)$, we see that $a$ is in the image of $T^r: F(n) \\\\to F(n)$. Using the Lemma again, all nonzero fibers of $T^r$ are of size $p^r$, so there are $p^r$ roots of $T^r(x)\\=a$ in $F(n)$. Since Roland's polynomial only has degree $p^r$, we see that all roots of $T^r(x)\\=a$ are in $F(n)$.\n\nAll proper subfields of $F(n)$ are contained in $F(n\\-1\\)$. But, since $r \\\\geq p^{n\\-1}$, the Lemma shows that $T^r(x)\\=0$ on $F(n\\-1\\)$. So none of the roots of $T^r(x)\\=a$ are in $F(n\\-1\\)$.\n\nWe conclude that all the factors of Roland's polynomial are of degree $p^n$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider the polynomial $f(x) = x^p - x + a$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$, where $p$ is prime and $a$ is a non-zero element of $\\mathbb{F}_p$.

The polynomial $f(x) = x^p - x + a$ is always irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ for all primes $p$ and non-zero $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$. This can be proven using the following argument:\n\n1) Suppose $f(x)$ has a root $r$ in some extension field of $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\n2) The other roots of $f(x)$ would be of the form $r+1, r+2, ..., r+p-1$.\n3) If $f(x)$ were reducible, it would factor as $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$ where $g,h \\in \\mathbb{F}_p[x]$ and $\\deg(g) = d < p$.\n4) The coefficient of $x^{d-1}$ in $g(x)$ would be $-(dr + \\sum c_i)$ where $c_i$ are elements of $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\n5) This implies $dr \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$. However, if $d \\neq 0 \\mod p$, then $r \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$, which contradicts the fact that $f(x)$ has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\n6) Therefore, $d$ must be either 0 or $p$, meaning the factorization is trivial and $f(x)$ is irreducible.\n\nThis result holds for all primes $p$ and all non-zero $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$, making C the correct answer. The other options are incorrect: A is false as $f(x)$ is never reducible, B is false as irreducibility doesn't depend on $a$ being primitive, and D is false as the result holds for all primes, not just Mersenne primes."}, "51": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/07/03", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/503794", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/352348/"], "docs_id": 503794, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For example:\n\n> A well thought\\-out system streamlines operation, improves work\n>  process, reduces data redundancy.....\n\nIf ***can*** is added to the sentence, should the following verb be singular or plural? \n\n> A well thought\\-out system can streamline operation, *improve* work\n>  process, *reduce* data redundancy.....\n\nor \n\n> A well thought\\-out system can streamline operation, *improves* work\n>  process, *reduces* data redundancy.....\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The verb \"can\" is modifying all three verbs, not just the first one (all three verb\\-object pairs are predicates of \"can\").

Had the authority also grown like the size of ulcer had?\nOr the ulcer also gave a twinge to his authority as an interpreter like it dit to him?\nFor what is *preposition to* after America? What's the grammatical function?\nIt's so confusing and I can't guess even the least of its meaning.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Well, it's great that you're learning with Vonnegut but you have to go in knowing that he's going to be playful with language and frequently ironic.\n\n> His ulcer gave him a twinge...\n\nThis should be straightforward.\n\n> ...the ulcer that had grown in size and authority over the years...\n\nHere, the *authority* is an odd word that catches the reader and personifies the ulcer. It gives it the aura of a parent, a teacher, a policeman, a pastor, or governor, which is odd. At the same time, it's understandable: as the ulcer becomes stronger, it exerts more control over the man and his life.\n\nThe man's authority didn't necessarily grow: the *ulcer's* power over his life did.\n\n> ...over the years of his career as an interpreter of America to provincial and ignorant notables from backwaters of civilization.\n\nThis section has nothing to do with the authority, except by ironic contrast. \n\n...*of his career*... modifies the *years* and, given the timing, indirectly states that his ulcer is due to his career.\n\n...*as an interpreter*... modifies the *career* and explains what it is. \n\nYou seem to be taking it literally, though, and ...*an interpreter of America*... is obviously not a translator of languages but a tour guide, cultural professor, \\&c. who metaphorically acts as an interpreter.\n\n...*to provincial and ignorant notables from backwaters of civilization* explains to whom he is interpreting America. On the surface, it's a very jingoistic way to phrase it that may make the author seem to be very pro\\-American. In fact, given (a) that this is Vonnegut, (b) the content of the rest of this book, and (c) the content of the rest of this sentence (the man's job is so unhealthy as to have taken control of his life via his ulcer), it is unquestionably ironic and anti\\-American.

The phrase \"grown in size and authority\" is a playful use of language by Vonnegut to personify the ulcer. While the physical size of the ulcer has increased, the \"authority\" refers to the ulcer's increasing power and control over the man's life, not the man's own authority. This interpretation is supported by the context of the sentence, which suggests that the man's career as an interpreter has been detrimental to his health, leading to the growth of the ulcer.

You are not experiencing any memory issues in your screenshot above. What I suspect is happening is that OS X is creating some placeholder of sorts to enable swap memory, rather than actually using swap memory here. I have never seen a zero in the swap memory section, unless I have just restarted and open the Activity Monitor window fresh, and even then, I rarely see zero. \n\nWith Mavericks and Yosemite, the way the OS uses memory changed a bit. Essentially, the OS takes all the memory, and then manages it out as needed. So, our traditional way of looking at the memory report in Activity Monitor is not really valid. Due to this, Mavericks added the 'Memory Pressure' gauge, to give you an idea of when you have a limitation caused by memory. In your screenshot, you have a green memory pressure.

The system creates a placeholder for swap memory, which doesn't necessarily mean it's actively using that swap memory. This is part of how macOS manages memory, particularly since the introduction of Mavericks and Yosemite. The presence of swap memory, even when free memory is available, doesn't indicate a problem.

changes below paths.\n\n**Path** : `vendor/magento/framework/DB/Adapter/Pdo/Mysql.php`\n\n**Look For** \\-\\-\\> `public function prepareColumnValue(array $column, $value)`\n\n> **Replace below old code:**\n\n```\ncase 'longtext':\n    $value  = (string)$value;\n    if ($column['NULLABLE'] && $value == '') {\n        $value = null;\n    }\n break;\n\n```\n\n> **With new code:**\n\n```\ncase 'longtext':\n    if(!is_array($value)) $value  = (string)$value;\n    else $value = '';\n    if ($column['NULLABLE'] && $value == '') {\n        $value = null;\n    }\n   break;\n\n```\n\nLet me know if this one resolve your issue."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: When encountering a network error in Magento 2 related to saving payment information, which of the following modifications to the prepareColumnValue function in the Mysql.php file is most likely to resolve the issue?\n\nA) Add a type check for array and convert to string only if not an array:\n   ```php\n   if(!is_array($value)) $value = (string)$value;\n   else $value = '';\n   ```\n\nB) Remove the type casting to string entirely:\n   ```php\n   $value = $value;\n   ```\n\nC) Add a null coalescing operator:\n   ```php\n   $value = $value ?? '';\n   ```\n\nD) Change the condition to check for empty string:\n   ```php\n   if ($column['NULLABLE'] && empty($value)) {\n       $value = null;\n   }\n   ```\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct modification is to add a type check for array and convert to string only if the value is not an array. This addresses a potential issue where an array value might be passed to a column expecting a string, which could cause errors in saving payment information. The solution ensures that array values are handled gracefully by converting them to an empty string, while non-array values are cast to strings as before. This modification is most likely to resolve the specific network error described in the original post without introducing new issues."}}
