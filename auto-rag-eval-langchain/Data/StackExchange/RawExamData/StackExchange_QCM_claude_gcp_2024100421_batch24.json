This requirement makes it difficult to work with allocators that itself contain state, rather than indirectly point to state.\n\n**Note:** The reason this may have worked for `vector` is because an allocator of type `T` doesn't get rebound on a `vector<T>`, since it only needs to allocate `n` instances of `T`. This is not true for more complex data structures like a `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, etc \\-\\- since there may be nodes of objects or other contiguous sequences internally used.\n\n---\n\n\\[1] Stateful allocators are stored directly into the containers that use them. This means that a `vector<T,MonotonicIncreasingAllocator<T,N>>` will now also store the allocator itself, containing an `array<T,N>`, directly inside of the `vector` class, in addition to its own data \\-\\- which is wasteful. Copying or even moving a container with this allocator would be an extremely expensive operation.\n\nAdditionally, by storing the data directly inside of the allocator, conversion\\-construction requires a copy of the entire internal `std::array` object, which means that the rebinding constructs a *new* object that refers to a different monotonic structure than the allocator that was being rebound \\-\\- which isn't ideal.\n\nYou should look into the architecture that's used in [`std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/polymorphic_allocator) for better inspiration. The `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator` holds onto 1 data type: a `std::memory_resource` pointer, which makes rebinding cheap, and storage of this allocator cheap. The `memory_resource` is type\\-ambiguous and passed by indirection, which allows for allocators after being rebound to use and refer to the same memory pool."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: When implementing a custom allocator for use with STL containers like std::unordered_map, which of the following is NOT a correct approach or consideration?\n\nA) Implement a rebind template to allow the allocator to be used with different types.\n\nB) Provide a conversion constructor that can construct from MonotonicIncreasingAllocator<U, max_size>& for any type U.\n\nC) Store the allocation data (like std::array<T, max_size>) directly inside the allocator to ensure efficient memory usage.\n\nD) Consider using a pointer to a memory resource, similar to std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator, to make rebinding and storage more efficient.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct because implementing a rebind template is essential for custom allocators to work with different types, as required by complex containers.\n\nB is correct as providing a conversion constructor allows the allocator to be rebound to different types, which is necessary for containers like unordered_map.\n\nC is incorrect.

Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, there seems to be no thorough discussion of this particular algorithm in the literature. In place of a reference, let us clarify how/why it works and test it a bit.\n\nThe `luq` routine inputs an $m$\\-by\\-$n$ matrix $A$ and outputs an $m$\\-by\\-$m$ invertible matrix $L$, an $n$\\-by\\-$n$ invertible matrix $Q$ , and an $m$\\-by\\-$n$ upper trapezoidal matrix $U$ such that: (i) $A\\=LUQ$ and (ii) the pivot\\-less columns/rows of $U$ are zero vectors. For example, \n$$\n\\\\underbrace{\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\& 1 \\\\\\\\\n1 \\& 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}}\\_A \\= \\\\underbrace{\\\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n1 \\& 1\n\\\\end{pmatrix}}\\_L \\\\underbrace{\\\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 0\n\\\\end{pmatrix}}\\_U \\\\underbrace{\\\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\& 1 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 1\n\\\\end{pmatrix}}\\_Q\n$$\n\nPoint (ii) allows one to construct bases for the left/right null spaces of $A$.\n\n*Bases for Left/Right Null Spaces of $A$*\n\nLet $r \\= \\\\operatorname{Rank}(A)$. Suppose we can compute the exact $LUQ$ decomposition of $A$ as described above. Then,\n\n* The $n\\-r$ columns of $Q^{\\-1}$ corresponding to the pivotless columns of $U$ are a basis for the null space of $A$. This follows from the fact that $\\\\operatorname{null}(A) \\= \\\\operatorname{null}(A Q^{\\-1}) \\= \\\\operatorname{null}(L U)$ and that the pivotless columns of $U$ are zero vectors by construction.\n* The $m\\-r$ rows of $L^{\\-1}$ corresponding to the pivotless rows of $U$ are a basis for the left null space of $A$. This follows from the fact that $\\\\operatorname{null}(A^T) \\= \\\\operatorname{null}((L^{\\-1} A)^T) \\= \\\\operatorname{null}( (U Q)^T)$ and that the pivotless rows of $U$ are zero vectors by construction.\n\n*LUQ Algorithm*\n\nAssume that $m \\\\ge n$. (If $m \\< n$, then the `lu` command mentioned below outputs a slightly different $PA\\=LU$ factorization. Otherwise the LUQ decomposition is almost the same, and so, we omit this case.)\n\nGiven an $m$\\-by\\-$n$ matrix $A$, the LUQ decomposition calls MATLAB command `lu` with partial (i.e., just row) pivoting. `lu` implements a variant of the LU decomposition that inputs $A$ and outputs: \n\n1. $m$\\-by\\-$m$ permutation matrix $P$;\n2. $m$\\-by\\-$n$ lower trapezoidal matrix $\\\\tilde L$ with ones on the diagonal; and,\n3. $n$\\-by\\-$n$ upper triangular matrix $\\\\tilde U$\n\nsuch that $PA \\= \\\\tilde L \\\\tilde U$. Write:\n$$\n\\\\tilde U \\= \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\tilde U\\_{11} \\& \\\\tilde U\\_{12} \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& \\\\tilde U\\_{22} \\\\end{bmatrix}\n$$ where $\\\\tilde U\\_{11}$ has nonzero diagonal entries, and hence, is invertible. \nAlso, let $e\\_i$ denote unit $m$\\-vectors equal to $1$ in the $i$th component and zero otherwise. The algorithm then builds:\n$$\nL \\= P^T \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\tilde L \\& e\\_{n\\+1} \\& \\\\cdots \\& e\\_m \\\\end{bmatrix} \n$$\nwhich is an $m \\\\times m$ invertible matrix, and\n$$\nU \\= \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\tilde U\\_{11} \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& \\\\tilde U\\_{22} \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}\n$$ which is upper trapezoidal, and\n$$\nQ \\= \\\\begin{bmatrix} I \\& \\\\tilde U\\_{11}^{\\-1} \\\\tilde U\\_{12} \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& I \\\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nwhich is an $n$\\-by\\-$n$ invertible matrix. To summarize, we obtain:\n$$\nA \\= L \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\tilde U\\_{11} \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& \\\\tilde U\\_{22} \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} Q \n$$ For the most part, that is all the algorithm does. However, if there are any nonzero entries in $\\\\tilde U\\_{22}$, then the algorithm will call `luq` again with input matrix containing all of the nonzero entries of $\\\\tilde U\\_{22}$. This last step introduces more zeros into $U$ and modifies the invertible matrices $L$ and $Q$. \n\nTo understand this last step, it helps to consider a simple input to `luq` like\n$$\nA \\= \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first call to `luq` with this input trivially gives $U\\=A$ with $L$ and $Q$ being the $3$\\-by\\-$3$ identity matrices. Since $U$ has nonzero entries, a second call is made to `luq` with input $1$, which outputs $L\\=U\\=Q\\=1$. This second decomposition is incorporated into the first one by making the second column of $L$ the first one and moving all the other columns to the right of it, and similarly, moving the third row of $Q$ to the first row and moving all the other rows below it.

In the first pass through `luq` the algorithm again sets $U\\=A$ and $L$, $Q$ equal to the $5$\\-by\\-$5$ identity matrices. Since $U\\=\\\\tilde U\\_{22}$ has nonzero elements, `luq` is called again with input matrix\n$$\nB \\= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \na \\& b \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& c \n\\\\end{pmatrix}\n$$ This is incorporated into the first decomposition by permuting $L$ and $Q$ as shown:\n$$\nA \\= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \n0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n1 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \n\\\\end{pmatrix} \n\\\\begin{pmatrix} a \\& b \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ \n 0 \\& c \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ \n 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ \n 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \n\\\\end{pmatrix}\n \\\\begin{pmatrix} \n0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\\\\\\\\n1 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \n\\\\end{pmatrix} \n$$\n In general, the columns of $L$ and the rows of $Q$ are permuted so that the the zero columns/rows of $\\\\tilde U\\_{22}$ are moved to the end of the matrix. An LUQ decomposition is then performed on this nonzero sub\\-block.\n\nA full explanation would be notation heavy (requiring index sets for the zero/nonzero elements) and not much easier to understand than the code itself.\n\n*Simple Test*\n\nIn reality, the algorithm computes an approximate LUQ decomposition and approximate bases, i.e., with rounding errors. These rounding errors might be significant if some of the nonzero singular values of $A$ are too small for the algorithm to detect.\n\n[Here](http://www.crab.rutgers.edu/~nb361/mysoftware/demo2.m) is a MATLAB script file that tests the `luq` code. The script is a slight modification of the demo file that the software comes with. I modified the original file so that it inputs a sparse, random, rectangular, rank deficient matrix and outputs bases for the left/right null spaces of this input matrix. \n\nHere is a sample output from this demo file.\n\n```\n elapsed time = 0.011993 seconds\nInput matrix:\n size = 10000x500\n true right null space dimension = 23\n true left null space dimension = 9523\nOutput:\n estimated right null space dimension = 23\n estimated left null space dimension = 9523\n error in basis for right null space = 0\n error in basis for left null space = 2.2737e-13\n\n```\n\n*\"Extreme\" Test*\n\nThis example is adapted from Gotsman and Toledo \\[2008]. Consider the $(n\\+1\\)$\\-by\\-$n$ matrix:\n$$\nA\\_1 \\= \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\& \\& \\& \\& \\\\\\\\\n\\-1 \\& 1 \\& \\& \\& \\\\\\\\\n\\\\vdots \\& \\-1 \\& \\\\ddots \\& \\& \\\\\\\\\n\\\\vdots \\& \\& \\\\ddots \\& 1 \\& \\\\\\\\\n\\-1 \\& \\-1 \\& \\\\cdots \\& \\-1 \\& 1 \\\\\\\\\n0\\.5 \\& 0\\.5 \\& \\\\cdots \\& 0\\.5 \\& 0\\.5 \n\\\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nand in terms of this matrix, define the block diagonal matrix:\n$$\nA \\= \\\\begin{bmatrix} A\\_1 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& A\\_2 \\\\end{bmatrix}\n$$ where $A\\_2$ is an $n$\\-by\\-$n$ random symmetric positive definite matrix whose eigenvalues are all equal to one except $3$ are zero and one is $10^{\\-8}$. With this input matrix and $n\\=1000$, we obtain the following sample output.\n\n```\n elapsed time = 1.1092\nthe matrix:\n size of A = 2001x2000\n true rank of A = 1997\n true right null space dimension = 3\n true left null space dimension = 4\nresults:\n estimated right null space dimension = 3\n estimated left null space dimension = 4\n error in basis for right null space = 9.2526e-13\n error in basis for left null space = 5.9577e-14\n\n```\n\n*Remark*\n\nThere is an option in the `luq` code to use LU factorization with complete (i.e., row and column) pivoting $PAQ\\=LU$. The resulting $U$ matrix in the $LUQ$ factorization may better reflect the rank of $A$ in more ill\\-conditioned problems, but there is an added cost to doing column pivoting. \n\n**Reference**\n\nKowal, P. \\[2006]. \"Null space of a sparse matrix.\"  \n\n[https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11120\\-null\\-space\\-of\\-a\\-sparse\\-matrix](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11120-null-space-of-a-sparse-matrix)\n\nGotsman, C., and S.

In the LUQ decomposition, the columns of Q^(-1) corresponding to the zero columns of U form a basis for the null space of A. This is because null(A) = null(AQ^(-1)) = null(LU), and the zero columns of U correspond to the basis vectors of the null space.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's the inverse of Q, not Q itself, that relates to the null space basis. \n\nOption B is incorrect because it refers to L instead of Q, and to rows instead of columns.

The most likely cause of the issue is that the user-theme extension is not installed, which is necessary for applying custom themes in GNOME Shell. \n\nThe correct solution would be to install the user-theme extension from the GNOME extensions website (https://extensions.gnome.org/) or using the method described in the provided links.

Just with these options alone I end up with nearly 10,000 simple products for a single configurable product. Each of these options effect the price, weight and image of the product. Excluding finger size, where it only changes the price and weight after a certain point, for example finger sizes between 3 and 8 (US) or F and P (UK) are one price and weight, and sizes between 9 and 13 (US) or Q and Z (UK) are another price and weight.\n*I plan on having about 4 configurable products around this size, and another 100 or so with slightly less options.*\n\nThe main issue I run into is the page size and load time, which I can only assume is down to the large amount of javascript that is on the page, containing all the prices and image locations for each combination of options, to allow for the price to be updated. Currently using the blank theme with only a single image per product option I get page load times of between 4 and 6 seconds and a page size of around 800kb, but ideally I would have three images per product option, so I can only imagine these will get worse. This is also when the page has been cached, if I refresh the cache the page load time drops to over 30 seconds.\n\nAs a side note, I have also changed the way Magento fetches the product images when an option is changed, by default it performs an ajax call to get the data, but this was taking around 10 seconds to complete. So I rewrote the javascript to fetch the image urls from the large pool of javascript already on the page, just like the way it fetches the price, which allows for instantaneous image updating.\n\nAnother issue I am facing is when trying to make a change to the configurable product in the admin panel, my browser tends to crash which I can only assume is down to the 10,000 simple products that are trying to be loaded in to the configurations panel.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how else I can create these products, or any way to improve page size and load time with such large configurable products?\n\nThanks in advance,\nChris.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We've open sourced our solution for using configurable products with an extremely large amount of associated simple products; <https://github.com/elgentos/LargeConfigProducts>, which has a workaround for this issue."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A jewellery store built in Magento 2 is experiencing performance issues due to complex configurable products with numerous options.

With the 'on grid' option, the .center anchors of the nodes are used for distance calculations instead. This changes how relative positioning works, as measurements are taken from different reference points on the nodes depending on whether 'on grid' is used or not.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while 'on grid' does affect alignment, it doesn't force perfect alignment with a background grid.

Usually revolution refers only to celestial bodies. Since the Earth travels around much bigger sun in an elliptical trajectory, it is a revolution. Both phenomena, the rotation and the revolution, are described very thoroughly [on this website](http://www.differencebetween.info/difference-between-rotate-and-revolve)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which combination of statements about Earth's movement is most accurate?\n\nA) The Earth rotates around the sun while spinning on its axis.

It correctly distinguishes between revolution (Earth's movement around the sun) and rotation (Earth's spin on its own axis). It also accurately states that both \"revolve\" and \"orbit\" are acceptable terms for describing Earth's movement around the sun, while \"rotate\" specifically refers to Earth's axial spin.

Can it be considered either?\n\nThe simple answer was this:\nLoved is still a verb, but it's the past participle, so it plays a similar role to an adjective.\n\nMy question is why is loved here classified as a past participle and not simple past. If the sentence was:\nHe was loved.\nIn that sentence would loved still be a past participle or would it be simple past?\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It may help to straighten out some terminology. *Loved* is always a past participle. That's because the past participle of a regular verb adds the suffix *\\-ed* to the regular form (i.e., the form used in the infinitive), with the proviso that the suffix replaces a final *e*. This means that past participles are always verb forms.\n\nPast participles have a role in the predicate of indicating tense and voice:\n\n* With the auxiliary *have* for the present perfect tense (\"I *have* always **loved** you.\")\n* With the auxiliary *had* for the past perfect tense (\"I *had* **loved** you before I hated you.\")\n* With the auxiliary forms of *be* for the passive voice. (\"You *are* **loved** by me.\")\n\nPast participles have roles outside the predicate. They can modify nouns. Consider Evelyn Waugh's novel *The **Loved** One*.\n\nThey can head noun phrases. We don't use *loved* this way, relying on the now\\-defective verb *belove*, which appears only in the passive: \"My **beloved** is like a gazelle....\"\n\nAnd they can appear in absolutes, associated with main clauses: \"**Loved** by all, the general bowed to the cheering crowd.\"\n\nWith these uses comes a syntactic ambiguity. When the past participle (e.g, *loved*) follows the third person singular, present tense of *to be* (i.e, *is*), are we to interpret *is* as 1\\) an auxiliary forming the passive voice or 2\\) a copular verb followed by a nominative predicate? To rephrase, does\n\n> He is loved\n\nmean that he is 1\\) an object of love or 2\\) a recipient of loving? That's a matter of semantics. We can only tell for sure if an agent is identified in a prepositional phrase with *by*:\n\n> He is loved only by his mother.\n\nThat's case 1\\), the passive voice, because we can transpose to active voice:\n\n> Only his mother loves him."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In the sentence \"He is loved by everyone,\" which of the following statements is true about the word \"loved\"?\n\nA) It is functioning as an adjective\nB) It is a simple past tense verb\nC) It is a past participle used in passive voice construction\nD) It is a present perfect tense verb\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) Incorrect. While past participles can sometimes function similarly to adjectives, in this sentence \"loved\" is part of a passive voice construction and maintains its verbal nature.\n\nB) Incorrect. \"Loved\" is not in simple past tense here. The simple past would be \"Everyone loved him.\"\n\nC) Correct. \"Loved\" is a past participle used in a passive voice construction. The presence of \"is\" (a form of \"to be\") followed by the past participle \"loved\" and the agent introduced by \"by\" (by everyone) clearly indicates passive voice.\n\nD) Incorrect. The present perfect tense would use \"have\" or \"has\" as an auxiliary (e.g., \"He has loved\"), which is not the case in this sentence.\n\nThis question tests understanding of verb forms, particularly past participles, and their use in passive voice constructions, as well as the ability to distinguish between different tenses and verbal functions."}, "35": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/04/21", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/190553", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/71305/"], "docs_id": 190553, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am using `gdalogr:merge`in Python console in order to merge to rasters (.tif) But I don't really understand the first parameter, where I have to put two variables.\n\nI get the following error:\n\n> Unable to execute algorithm  \n> \n> Wrong parameter value: ras1; ras2\n> \n> \n> None\n\n```\nimport processing   \nfrom processing.core.Processing import Processing\nfrom qgis.core import *\nfrom qgis.gui import *\n\nras1 =QgsRasterLayer(\"H:/pyQGIS/DATA_U6/mdt_483.tif\",\"MDT483\")\nras2 = QgsRasterLayer(\"H:/pyQGIS/DATA_U6/mdt_508.tif\", \"MDT508\")\n\nQgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayers([ras1])\nQgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayers([ras2])\n\nmerj = processing.runalg(\"gdalogr:merge\",'ras1; ras2', False, False, 4,\"H:/pyQGIS/DATA_U6/mdt_mosaico.tif\")\nprint(repr(merj))\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The algorithm expects (in the first argument) the input raster paths using a semicolon as separator.

Under what conditions is it true that for every $x \\\\in sX\\\\setminus X$ there is a uniformly discrete set $Q\\\\subseteq X$ such that $x\\\\in \\\\overline{Q}$?\n\nI believe this is true for $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ and any space that is 'uniformly locally compact' in the sense that there is some $\\\\varepsilon\\>0$ such that every closed $\\\\varepsilon$\\-ball is compact and for every $\\\\delta\\>0$ there is an $n$ such that every closed $\\\\varepsilon$\\-ball can be covered by at most $n$ open $\\\\delta$\\-balls.

The documentation explains that the furnace is responsible for circulating air and does not inherently know the air conditioner exists. When the thermostat calls for AC, it should also call for the furnace fan to run. The fact that the fan works in heat mode but not in AC mode suggests a communication issue between the thermostat and the furnace specifically for AC operation.

In quantum mechanics, an electron in an atomic orbital does not have a definite speed or velocity. Its state is not an eigenstate of the velocity operator, so the speed isn't sharply determined.

Do you feel there are any issues with the relative amount and types of participation on ServerFault of long\\-term, high\\-rep users compared to newer, lower\\-rep users? If so, what would you try to do as a moderator to address these issues?\n\nI think it's unfortunate that many long\\-term, high\\-rep users have largely stopped participating on ServerFault, there are fewer highly experienced sysadmins posting excellent answers than there used to be. I don't think there's much that a single moderator can do to either bring back the users who left or to develop new high\\-rep users.\n\nFor example, I've tried a few times over the years to focus on voting for new users who were fairly active to see if that encouraged them to stick around, but I didn't see any sign of it working. I don't think a single person or a single moderator can do much to encourage people to stick around and become long\\-term users.\n\n> 2. What time zone are you in? If different, what time zones do you think you will be able to be active in for the purposes of moderation? ([HBrujin](https://serverfault.com/users/37681/hbruijn) will be stepping down as a moderator after this election, which leaves [Sven](https://serverfault.com/users/8897/sven) as the only coverage during active CET hours)\n\nAs mentioned in my nomination, I'm in the Pacific (UTC\\-8\\) time zone, and tend to stay up late. \n\n> 3. Moderators see the review\\-queues a little differently. How do you see yourself handling answers from a new user that could be great with a little clarification, yet has earned at least one `not an answer` flag?\n\nThe ideal thing to have happen with an answer that could be improved by a bit of cleanup is for it to be edited, and moderators can do that as can many regular users. But the whole point of review queues is that it *shouldn't* be just moderators handling that sort of clean up, so I think most of those cases would be better dealt with by comments \\- suggesting what could make it a better answer.\n\n> 4. What do you believe a moderators role is, in cultivating good content for the site? With the decline in both new content and votes, do you believe as a moderator this should affect your behavior?\n\nAlthough moderators have some tools for eliminating bad content, I don't think they should be soley responsible for it; regular users need to be involved as well. When it comes to encouraging good content, I think moderators should lead by example to some extent (e.g. by editing and leaving constructive comments), but they can't be expected to do all the editing and commenting.\n\n> 5. How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?\n\nI think the usual tool for dealing with this \\- a temporary ban \\- is the right way to go. Explain to the user what the problem is and use the banning system to give them a chance to cool off.\n\n> 6. How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?\n\nIn order, I would: talk to that mod and try to come to an understanding, discuss it with other SF mods, and finally bring it up in the mod\\-only discussion room if necessary. Somewhere along that path, I'm sure there'd be an understanding of how it should/shouldn't have been dealt with.\n\n> 7. In your opinion, what do moderators do?\n\nI think moderators *should* mostly deal with the bigger problems: with accounts that are spamming, with voting irregularities, with comments getting out of hand, etc. I think the second special thing about moderators is that because their words carry somewhat more weight, they shouuld try to maintain a desirable \"tone\" for the site \\- leaving good comments, etc.\n\n> 8. A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?\n\nI'm comfortable with everything I've posted on SF, on meta.SF, on other SE sites, on Chat... I don't think there's anything that would look bad with a diamond after it, and at this point in ServerFault's life cycle it's unlikely that anyone is going to find much that's interesting in *any* 7 or 8 year old post or comment.\n\n> 9. In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?\n\nModerators have a few tools that even a high\\-rep user doesn't: unilateral close or open voting, comment cleanup, banning... Those could all be used to greater effectiveness."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: As a newly elected moderator on ServerFault, you notice a high-rep user who consistently provides valuable answers but frequently engages in argumentative behavior in comments, resulting in numerous flags. What is the most appropriate course of action?\n\nA) Immediately ban the user permanently to maintain a positive community atmosphere.\nB) Ignore the flags, as the user's valuable contributions outweigh any negative behavior.\nC) Implement a temporary ban, explain the issue to the user, and allow them time to adjust their behavior.\nD) Remove the user's ability to comment but allow them to continue posting answers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach, as outlined in the moderator candidate's response, is to implement a temporary ban and explain the issue to the user. This allows the valuable contributor a chance to cool off and adjust their behavior while still acknowledging the problem. It strikes a balance between maintaining community standards and recognizing the user's positive contributions.

This implies that the save is more critical and difficult, hence the \"epic\" designation and higher point award (60 points instead of 50 for a regular save). Regular saves occur when the ball is stopped further from the goal, where the threat is less imminent.

This means your model will be really close to your training data. \n\nThe variance is high, because optimizing on only 1\\-nearest point means that the probability that you model the noise in your data is really high. Following your definition above, your model will depend highly on the subset of data points that you choose as training data. If you randomly reshuffle the data points you choose, the model will be dramatically different in each iteration. So \n\n> expected divergence of the estimated prediction function from its average value (i.e. how dependent the classifier is on the random sampling made in the training set)\n\nwill be high, because each time your model will be different.\n\n**Example**\nIn general, a k\\-NN model fits a specific point in the data with the N nearest data points in your training set. For 1\\-NN this point depends only of 1 single other point. E.g. you want to split your samples into two groups (classification) \\- red and blue. If you train your model for a certain point p for which the nearest 4 neighbors would be red, blue, blue, blue (ascending by distance to p). Then a 4\\-NN would classify your point to blue (3 times blue and 1 time red), but your 1\\-NN model classifies it to red, because red is the nearest point. This means, that your model is really close to your training data and therefore the bias is low. If you compute the RSS between your model and your training data it is close to 0\\. In contrast to this the variance in your model is high, because your model is extremely sensitive and wiggly. As pointed out above, a random shuffling of your training set would be likely to change your model dramatically. In contrast, 10\\-NN would be more robust in such cases, but could be to stiff.

E.g. you might estimate the effect of color on sales or something similar.\n\nBut what if some predictors only make sense for some of the product types? Like a \"leg length\" feature might make sense for shorts if people have preference for how far above or below the knee they like their shorts, but not for pants which are always full length. And it may make yet less sense for shirts, since the do not at all have a leg length.\n\nIn that case, is there a way to handle that or is it best to have different models per group? For the features that are shared and are expected to be drawn from the same distribution, I guess we lose some benefit there, so that's why I'm wondering if the models can be done as a single model.\n\nI've thought about a number of things (e.g. for products that don't have the feature, setting it to a constant value, or to a random value drawn from a distribution of feature values from products where the feature does make sense, etc) but all seem to have very obvious problems.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There's a pretty sensible way of doing this if you centre all your predictors by subtracting the mean value.\n\nUsing your example, say you have athletic shorts, shorts, and jeans, and your numeric predictors are a) brightness (defined for all categories), and b) short length (defined for shorts only, `NA` for trousers). Now, if you centre your both your numeric predictors, you get measures of a) whether the items are darker or lighter than average, and b) whether the shorts are shorter or longer than average. You can safely say that the trousers are $\\\\pm0$ cm shorter or longer than average, and so impute a value of 0 for this predictor for all items that aren't shorts (they're neither shorter nor longer than average). You can then fit a multilevel as you normally would, allowing all predictors to vary across categories:\n\n```\nlmer(sales ~ 1 + centred_colour + centred_leg_length + \n             (1 + centred_colour + centred_leg_length | category),\n     data=sales_data)\n\n```\n\nSince this predictor only varies for the different kinds of shorts, only sales of those items will have an effect on this parameter. Since it's set to 0 for all other products, this predictor won't affect inferences or predictions about them.\n\nIf it happens that you end up with only one category of shorts in your data,\nif won't be possible to include it as a random effect, and you'll have to change your model accordingly:\n\n```\nlmer(sales ~ 1 + centred_colour + centred_leg_length + \n             (1 + centred_colour | category),\n     data=sales_data)\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A retail company is analyzing sales data for various clothing items including shorts, pants, and shirts.

Which approach would be most appropriate for handling this scenario in a single model?\n\nA) Create separate models for each product category to avoid issues with irrelevant features.\nB) Use the raw values for all features, setting leg length to 0 for shirts and pants.\nC) Center all numeric predictors, impute 0 for leg length where not applicable, and include all predictors in a single multilevel model.\nD) Randomly assign values from the shorts' leg length distribution to pants and shirts.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate approach based on the information provided. By centering all numeric predictors (subtracting the mean), we create measures that represent deviation from the average. For features like leg length that only apply to certain categories (e.g., shorts), we can impute 0 for other categories, indicating they are neither shorter nor longer than average. This allows us to include all predictors in a single multilevel model while ensuring that irrelevant features don't affect inferences or predictions for categories where they don't apply. This approach maintains the benefits of a unified model while appropriately handling category-specific features.\n\nOption A loses the benefits of shared information across categories. Option B uses raw values, which could lead to incorrect inferences. Option D introduces random noise that could skew results. Therefore, C is the most statistically sound approach for this scenario."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/10/27", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/1749861", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/217441/"], "docs_id": 1749861, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm using a Mac Pro (2019\\) with the newest OS X available.

The documentation explicitly states that \"The problem with cloning the Windows partition, is that it has no boot code. The boot is handled by bootcamp, which is not part of the Windows partition.\" This means that simply cloning the partition won't work (eliminating option A), and it's not impossible to create a portable installation (eliminating option D). The fact that Boot Camp asks to remove external drives during installation doesn't mean Windows won't work with other drives later (eliminating option B). The key issue is the boot code, which requires additional steps using tools like Hasleo WinToUSB to create a bootable external Windows drive from a Boot Camp partition."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/08/22", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/321417", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/150477/"], "docs_id": 321417, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the following passage, I know here the word \"authority\" should not be the meaning: \"political or administrative power and control\", it's not suitable in this context.\n\nMay be, I think the meaning of it will be \"tradition or rite and ritual\".
